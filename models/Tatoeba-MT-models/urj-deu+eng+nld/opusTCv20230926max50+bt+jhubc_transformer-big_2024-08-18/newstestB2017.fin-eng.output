28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
A 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead on the steps of a local shopping mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his business in order."
The body found at the Westfield shopping mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, according to the San Francisco Forensic Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he became the chef of San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small and close team, like a family. We miss it big," the spokesperson says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells Frank that he first lived in hostels, but he had finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was the brother who walked with the river.
In spite of all the wrongs happening in the world, he was a rough diamond that shone every day,” he says.
Anyone with any information about the incident will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline number 415-575-4444.
Striking junior doctors call for new industrial action
Representatives of British junior doctors (mainly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade unions and asked for permission for new collective action in the dispute over the new employment contract.
The junior medical committee (JDC), a member of the British Medical Association (BMA), is asking its entire government to support further industrial action as of early September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not solved the problems related to the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with the BMA in a vote in July.
The agreement was rejected by 58% of the votes cast.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the junior medical committee, tweeted Thursday night in a letter to JDC members saying the government had "persevered" on issues that McCourt said led to the deal being rejected.
The letter reads: “In light of this, the JDC government has voted against an entirely new draft treaty and demands that all of our concerns be re-negotiated.
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC government has today made an official request to the BMA government to request permission for progressively expanding collective action from early September.”
As a result of the controversy, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete shutdowns in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawia, the director of BMA’s junior doctors, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms and conditions recommended by BMA.
At the pre-vote meetings, Malawi told BMA members that the agreement was a good one and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would enter into force and concern doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and formally end an eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of his St. Petersburg Palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
Both sides shook hands,
But Putin’s smile looked thin, and there was little warmth from him, not even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his “good friend” Mr Putin – according to one report, five times.
Personally, I didn’t keep up with the calculations.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country reported that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I understood his enthusiasm quite the opposite.
But the constant coolness from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction to the incident was horrific.
Putin attacked Ankara in harsh terms and accused him of stabbing her in the back.
The insult was all the more serious because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain true trust.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
Most serious were the accusations of top officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in IS-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has denied the allegations.
The official message from St. Petersburg, however, was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only held so that Putin could receive the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia might have won some sort of victory.
The benefits of a severe ceasefire are clear.
Above all, Mr Erdogan needs all his possible friends after he was almost ousted last month in a failed coup d'état.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic impetus for reconciliation.
Russia’s sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter ban, as several million Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly sigh of relief when air traffic can finally be resumed.
They put their faith in the late-season raid on the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall when Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
“Tourists go there, tomatoes go back here,” Vedemosti wrote in an article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
He is angry with the West because he thinks the West has reacted softly to the attempted coup.
Without forgetting the old resentment about Turkey’s EU accession negotiations at a sluggish pace and Putin’s interference, who is eager to exploit the cool ties and break Turkey’s ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when he expressed his support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident for Moscow, which is deeply concerned about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey were able to pass on a picture, described by one analyst as a “coalition of outsiders”, in a magnificent seaside palace, with a summit: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West are joining forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It says a lot that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents said at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue at all.
The Turkish president deliberately refused to answer the question about the differences between the two countries, while Putin emphasized them.
There is no clear consensus between the two countries as to where they can seek a consensus in Syria.
Given the possibility of a total disaster caused by the shooting down of a Russian fighter plane by NATO member Turkey, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostilities, the two heads of state are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside of Scotland
According to the President of RBS, the Bank's activities outside Scotland will be reduced to provide only business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the bank’s global goals.
The bank was forced to backtrack when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored international sports for millions of pounds, including Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to let more national brands into the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be abbreviated as RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWest, except for head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain more weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “RBS will become an investment brand and the one that our staff is working for because we are now becoming a much more diverse brand bank.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our aspirations are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands.”
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sport sponsorship.
"Now is the right time to switch to a bank with different brands, because the fundamental question is how we can make the bank better for our customers," said the bank's president.
“Three years ago, it would have been very scornful if we had said we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced the brands.
But the work we have done and the focus on customer needs instead of our own has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.”
Frankie Dettori rides Predilection to win at Newmarket and wins 3,000th prize
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, which meant him a 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone by riding his horse, Predilection, twice to win the same night on the track of his locality, a horse trained by John Gosden.
Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the races on a flat track.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Triple Master Jockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayjar, says, “This is special.
My feelings are overwhelmed because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The event is not big, no Royal Ascot, but a perfectly ordinary Friday night with a 20,000-strong audience.
I am relieved and feel great humility.”
Dettori receives cheers with Predilection after winning
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in barrier hockey competitions, and they are master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of his time, and it's no surprise that he is the one who has reached this milestone that few have ever reached.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical excellence is what sets him apart from others.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, and his enthusiasm and qualifiers have brought supporters to the sport for years."
“I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races if he hadn’t just raced on weekends and in big races!
Frankie’s racing career in the UK has been winning for almost 30 years, and it’s been amazing to watch.
He is a vivid person, which is good for British racing, but above all, he is an incredible jockey.”
Frankie Dettori aired her achievements in a distinctive way by flying off her horse.
"From aeronautical landings to aeronautical landings, Frankie Dettori has been an example of British racing for two decades.
There have been ups and downs along the way.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 as the "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a plane crash and been banned for drug abuse.
When the ban came to an end three years ago, he initially had startup difficulties, but he showed admirable character strength, showed his doubters and returned to his best.
And he won’t be finishing his career for a while – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue his racing career until he’s at least 50 years old.”
Putin sacked Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been Putin’s trusted insider for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that President Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but did not state the reasons for his dismissal.
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov’s deputy manager since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later headed the president's protocol department and the government's office, according to the Kremlin's Russian-language website.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State, which means drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are implemented."
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for his resignation and recommended the persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, has a KGB past.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on Russian state television, both said Ivanov would resign at his own request.
Despite the smiles on the cameras, the explanations convince only a few, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Are they the result of some sort of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been extremely suspicious of the official claim that a man who has been praised as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin's website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, in which he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
I have now served as the President's Chief of Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service (KGB).
When Putin served as the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy head.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin’s election for a third term.
The task, however, went to another of Putin’s close associates, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, after which he returned to office just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds FBI investigators star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producer
Gibson was involved in a violent quarrel at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios announced the sacking in a joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner had apologized on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
“We had creative differences.
I am sorry that this happened,” he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson’s character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be released later, according to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old Gibson, who previously starred in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement.
"I was hoping to see the series through, but it's no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and most importantly, the best fans the show could have ever hoped for.”
The 12th season of the series begins in the United States on September 28.
The Mysterious Landing of Fish in the Banff Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are wind turbines that have landed in the wake of a hurricane.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the seashore, released footage of the vision on Periscope and hoped to get a response to the appearance of these five-centimeter fish.
Queensferry Bridge is now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Bridge and the land bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four sections between the "decks" that are now almost complete around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tow ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Finance Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
Brown says: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, which has been built with more than 30,000 pieces of concrete and steel alone.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete deck molding in Rosyth today, which means the deck is ready to be lifted into place.”
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors Project Manager, says: “The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant pivot in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, this proportion represents the top of the road and civil engineering industry.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and connected to the road deck of the North Tower column, we then had to close the remaining north (i.e. land-side) gap.
This was done by pulling the north-facing land bridge 700 millimetres southward.
This was a massive and at the same time demanding operation.
Massive because the land bridge is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an angle of about 3%.
And it requires a lot of precision because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very low – just a few millimeters.
Thankfully, everything went well.”
Moelfre Bay Rescue Department Reports Three Men's Miracle Rescue
Three men stranded on a fishing boat near Anglesey were miraculously rescued.
The Moelfre RNLI sea rescue station issued an alert on Friday at 13.20 local time after its crew spotted an accident in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a pilot.
"We saw the boat circling right next to them and imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives Moelfre's lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had happily driven the boat away from them."
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, while a third, aged 60, was found exhausted, clinging to a buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all taken on board a coastal rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says, “It’s a miracle that these three men in the water are still alive and in perfect health.
The engine of the boat had an emergency fire-extinguishing rope, but for some reason it had been detached from the man who was driving the boat during the crash.
They were really lucky on their way.”
Pokémon Go Hunt Brings Health and Happiness
It’s fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Initially, screen time was limited to watching TV, then video games and, most recently, smartphones.
It is amazing to see that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude each other.
Pokémon Go is a game app with characters from a video game created in the 1990s (which was later also made into a series of cartoons, playing cards and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also paused shortly before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to huge interest, which overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go’s number of users surpassed Tinder and was almost as high as on Twitter.
So how does the game work?
In short, players go out on their smartphones in search of Pokémon, which are tracked by GPS. When a Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (via a screenshot of the phone) or "captured".
Wildness has captured the younger generation of video games and lifted their asses off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps a “average person” takes in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported, from the Cardiogram app on the Apple Watch smartwatch, which found within two days of the game’s launch that the number of people moving for 30 minutes a day rose abruptly from 45 percent to 53 percent. The Cardiogram tracks 35,000 users.
The company doesn’t know which users are playing Pokémon Go, it only sees raw data on the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move around for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
The importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
People who move regularly are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic health benefits – exercise, fresh air and sun and pleasure.
During the hunt, it is possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also disapproves of the cheerleaders.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door while playing.
What's the big deal?
The breakthrough is complete.
Because while smartphone apps like Fitbit could have tracked your activity before, they didn’t give you a reason to start, like Pokémon Go does.
The appeal of novelty disappears, and use decreases over time.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games where apps and virtual reality will be combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of people on a yacht and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortless on the boom.
Jaws shaking on the floor.
Brilliant in everything.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast won the multiplayer championship and increased the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
His overall score of 62.198 was clearly better than his silver-ranked "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will perform at the barrier in the women’s gymnastics singles multiplayer final on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth in a row and the fifth in a row to win the multiplayer championship, consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation, or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his total points in the final came to light and his long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to a whole new dimension and elevates him to the same category as other sports superstars like Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superior in his sport for the past three years, having won 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold medals, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest gymnast of all time".
In Brazil, there was one last race, which took place primarily between Biles and himself and the burden of over-expectations, rather than between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas for less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States are hugging after winning gold and silver in the women’s multiplayer at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won his first gold medal on Tuesday as a point for the farewell party of Martha Karoly, who coordinated the national team and is now retired.
Although Biles claimed to have never thought of anything in advance while at the top for a long time, that is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program—which includes a series of volts known as his trump card—is adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Adopted by her grandparents as a child and found by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother, Boorman found her on a daycare trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching.
He has not lost a single multi-match race since summer 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a small lead with two threads, it was like a canvas.
There was a boom and a permanto, where Biles is the defensive world champion.
He regained his leading position after scoring 15,433 points and crowned the final result with 15,933 points from the perm.
Raisman gently hugged him as they waited for the final points – which was a mere formality – and tears began to appear around the glittering tint of Biles’ red, white, and blue, as the dream he once wrote in his clipping book came true.
Raisman's performance was a small revenger to the race four years ago, when he first split the third place but then lost to Mustafa in the re-run.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader that the Americans call the team's "grandmother" was clearly ahead of Mustafa.
He sent air kisses to the audience after his permanto program and thus emerged from a losing position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
When it comes to Biles, this 19-year-old’s previous week and widespread tweeting now has a whole new meaning:
Police report three serial killers listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in the most devastating massacre in Phoenix in ten years. The victims were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, a police statement said Thursday.
On June 12, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead in a car parked on the street.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, from where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then fled in another car, the statement said.
Police suspect that the triple murder was not caused by the robbery, because the attacker did not take the handbags or the <0x24>2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said police are now investigating whether the death was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks that have taken place in predominantly Latin American-populated areas within four months.
"What the events have in common is that they have happened in residential areas outside the home," Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that the perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital for her injuries, where she later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died instantly at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police issued a statement saying that the shooting at an empty van had taken place just half an hour before the triple murder, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
Researchers found shells and recovered a bullet from the car seat and fragments of a bullet from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "Things are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital microcephaly, due to a genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto that he was unaware of when he was pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I wouldn’t get away with this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm not committed to this.
Which is not at all true – of course you’re committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them or survive at all.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t think there was any such practice anymore,” says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a rollator.
Edmund got up to sit down and didn't even start talking until he was three years old.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund’s invention of a sign that means “sing for me.”
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean ordinary sign language, but also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different diseases: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or zika virus.
Symptoms and predictions vary widely.
It is still too early to assess how it will affect the lives of those affected by the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
“I kept thinking about what would happen to us,
What will happen to us.”
And he still doesn't know.
“I haven’t asked for a prediction in a long time because I don’t think anyone will be able to give it.”
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the zika virus.
“Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you.”
Heavy rains and floods trigger massive rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi
The governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency on Friday due to heavy rains and widespread flooding. More rains in the state are still expected on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi are flooding and spreading over a large area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on its way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Office of Governors for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the agency received requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, only Tangipahoa County has asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain in force until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
According to a statement issued by the Weather Service, an additional 76–127 mm of water may enter the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile area.
Over the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record highs.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along the rivers could be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that flooding downstream in Ascension County poses a threat as flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, had risen higher than ever at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue work continued in the Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 meters away from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other son who lived nearby had warned him.
"We got up, and the water came in with a constant feed," Hansford says.
"It reached to my waist."
His wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family members are all injured, and he is the only one of them who is able to swim.
Rescue workers had rescued all three of them in a large military-style truck and taken them to a fire station in Gloster, where they held shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of information from an observer near Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was heavily wet after the rains began on Wednesday.
The authorities say that due to heavy rains and flooding of streets, residents of Tangipaho County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be canceled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipaho City Council had told WWL, a subsidiary of the television and radio company CBS, that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both of them.
Robby Miller, the county's chief, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been captured by the flood.
The evacuated people have been given shelter in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They can go back to their homes when the water starts to withdraw," he says.
In the town of Hammond, in Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets were closed due to flooding, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we experienced a major flood was in March," says City Council Member Lacy Landrum.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, steady rains continued along the Gulf Coast, says Harrison County Rescue Director Rupert Lacy.
Lacy said Thursday that a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded, but so far no reports had been received on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has lived in the Amite region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and it's raining all the time."
6-Year-Old Mahaj Brown Survives Philadelphia Shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, and he is the second six-year-old to have been shot in the city this week.
His grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that his son was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents said the boy had multiple gunshot wounds to his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television station.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family tells the television company that the boy is expected to survive.
He was about to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
The other 29-year-old was reported to be in critical condition and the other two were stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded may have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The scene was full of assault weapon-type shells from different types of assault weapons.
“It is clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shells on both sides of the street.
Several armed fighters have been present, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance videos.
Another 6-year-old girl who was shot dead in the city this week was struck by a stray bullet while playing outside her home in West Oak Lane on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering, and police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call the women's gymnastics olympic team, and there's more than one reason.
First of all, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as superior as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latino women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in 1st and 2nd place.
This is awesome.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became a surprise winner, and all of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as well as surprising and masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women’s singles multiplayer.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
The views are at the top of the sport, but the same does not look the same in gymnastics classes nationwide.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same trail as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They will be the final five, as there will only be four gymnasts for the next Olympic team in rack gymnastics, and this will be Marta Karoly’s final year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private gymnastics clubs maintained by their parents. The parents pay the training costs, facilities, trips, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
The facilities of most rack gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support activities.
The training of the gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it means a costly and long-term commitment for the families of the gymnasts.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both been coaching sports enthusiasts since they started rack gymnastics.
We need to organise more affordable and more accessible gymnastics classes for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered free or inexpensive facilities for gymnastics to more than 15,000 young people in the city (mostly blacks and Latin Americans), some of whom have achieved national and international championships.
In September, we will expand to my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality rack gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this awesome Olympic sport.
Artistic gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings life-long benefits and supports good health and success at school and at work.
This team has aroused the enthusiasm of thousands of young girls who now want to start gymnastics, and that is absolutely amazing.
Participating in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the true "girlpower" you showed when you won the Olympic gold medal, and for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to begin their journey to becoming well-being, strong and successful young women.
Junior Doctors Reject Jeremy Hunt's Proposal and Prepare for New Strikes
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over changes in pay and working conditions by approving a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the 37,000 so-called junior doctors who voted rejected the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt announced plans to force the agreement, saying the UK’s public health system was “on nobody’s land” and that any further delays would be damaging to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moving to a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve health care in anti-social times.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA's junior medical committee, issued a statement last night in which she said: "Junior doctors continue to have great reservations about the proposed agreement, with particular fears that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
There are only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move on, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has reacted reluctantly to attempts to discuss them, sometimes without even reacting in any way.
Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, the junior doctors will be ready for new industrial action.”
The last strike at the end of April postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support the strikers on strike guards.
Ministers hoped that the dispute over the changes would be brought to a conclusion by concluding a renewed agreement with British medical union officials.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be covered by the contract.
NHS chief of staff, Daniel Mortimer, urged junior doctors not to strike again.
Mortimer says: “The industrial action achieves very little or nothing, but it puts pressure on already marginalized teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption to patients, nursing staff and their families.
Over the last two months, we have been negotiating with the Committee on Junior Physicians, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the disclosure of malpractices.
The employees were hopeful that their continued positive commitment to other important issues – such as development, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from work breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector – was a sign of how seriously the employees, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health want to stick to the November, February and May agreements with the BMA.
A drug that costs about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about to receive the drug for about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 a day, as authorities recommended giving it to more people and for longer-term use.
Ticagrelor, an anticoagulant medicine, reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a member of the British public health system (NHS), has advised that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now, NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), a member of the UK’s public health system (NHS), has advised that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack every year, with a quarter of them having a heart attack or having a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot, which prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot is released, it can travel through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca in the UK and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
The draft NICE guideline published today recommends that ticagrelor be administered at a dose of 90 mg for the next 12 months, followed by a dose reduction to 60 mg, followed by aspirin twice daily for a further three years.
Carole Longson, a professor at the Center for the Adoption of Treatments (NICE), says: “While effective treatments are available to effectively prevent disease progression and the development of symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have had a heart attack have a new attack or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of recurrence can have a very negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
We have evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it.”
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular with regard to the risk of bleeding, are limited when used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period.
Due to a climate of political correctness, voter fraud flourished in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was sacked last year for corruption, resulting in a government report
A climate of political correctness led to the closing of eyes for widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, according to a government report released today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles severely criticized the police, election observers and city councils for having closed their eyes to electoral fraud “for sensitivities to ethnicity and religion.”
According to Pickles, a former Minister of Regional Administration and now an anti-corruption force, intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside the polling stations in order to protect the intimidated voters.
He proposes that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, all the voters have to do is give their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes dipping your fingers in indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He calls for better access for journalists to Government documents and to the decisions of informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and the culture that favours them more broadly in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the Tower Hamlet vote in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, to be dismissed due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court ruled that Rahman “sarcastically distorted” the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to be “using the religious duty of every Muslim to vote for him as the basis of his campaign.”
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or given in a fraudulent manner, with the person voting by pretending to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about post-election fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring an identity card at the polling station.
The report states: "There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of older members, especially in communities with a Pakistani and Bangladeshi background."
"There was concern that ... state institutions had closed their eyes to such actions because of the "politically correct" sensitivities to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballots, in order to prevent the "gathering of votes".
The report currently under consideration by Theresa May also calls for stricter checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the register of voting rights for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to present an identity document before voting.
Dipping your fingers into indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition on the handling of filled-in postal votes and postal voice envelopes by political activists.
The police have the right to form guard chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the Act to make it easier to prosecute intimidation under the 1983 Representation of the People Act.
Prohibition of photographing at polling stations.
Enable only English at polling stations (except Wales).
Reinforcement of training to ensure staff control of the rule that only one person may enter the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticizes the London police and finds it “astonishing” that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The Electoral Court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from office due to corruption and numerous illegal practices," he said.
"He was found guilty without serious suspicion and the threshold of criminal probation was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticised the ineffective "racial checks" carried out by the city council's electoral register departments.
"Last year's ruling in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call," said Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert electoral fraud and banning of it by some."
The resemblance of the Olympic cyclist to Duchess Catherine and other doubles in the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week with the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to discussions on social media, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the title who has a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all the Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the American male archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to the double character of Duchess Catherine, who was seen on the cycling tracks, many people have commented on social media about how one of the archers could be the actor's favorite twin brother, Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, the American men’s archery team, caused a storm after posting pictures of him on Twitter, in which he reminisces strikingly with the star of the film Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the social media noise and admitted that she had heard from a child that she resembled DiCaprio.
"I personally don't see the resemblance so great, except perhaps a beard and a mustache," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
At the 2012 London Games, the similarities between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were highlighted, which will no doubt be highlighted even more in these competitions.
The big-eyed Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been described as the twin of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison from the Glee television series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is the "athletic version" of the actor in the movie Inception.
Similarly, the similarity between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has long been noted, underscored by their strong eyebrows and lips.
Swimming silver medalist Yulia Efimova of Russia resembles actress Annalynne McCord, not only because of her beautifully tanned skin and light hair, while the US team Nathan Adrian is, according to his fans, an "atletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
The two iron women, football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in face shape and eyes.
Not only that: this Twitter user was delighted when others saw the resemblance as well.
This user wonders if there is a good reason for the couple's similarity.
A tweet recently expressed its delight when “others on the internet agree on the similarity between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter.”
The American football star and actor in the Dexter series really look strikingly similar in their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also found similarities in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and in the wide smiles of Gabrielle Union’s gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna Burns!
CBC Olympic commentator apologises for saying Chinese swimmer “dead like a pig”
Byron MacDonalds’ analysis of Ai Yanhan’s fourth place in the women’s 4 x 200 m freestyle message shocked viewers of CBC’s live Olympic report on Wednesday.
Canadian public broadcaster CBC has had to apologise after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “disappeared stinking” and “dead like a pig” during the race.
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started shooting his own opinions at the end of the women’s 4 x 200 m freestyle final.
MacDonald, who was taken to the CBC comment team to bring color, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese dick, baby.
He was too excited, he went fast, and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam in the second part of the message at 1:57.79, and was left with 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck in Canada, allowing Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????????????????????????????????
The idiot didn't realize he was on the air yet."
Ai Yanhan, a Chinese woman who slept in the finals of the women’s 4 x 200-metre freestyle message, was described with the following words: “This little 14-year-old Chinese dick, baby.
Twitter quickly overwhelmed Byron MacDonald with critical comments, and many demanded that he be fired.
The tweeters did not hold back when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
Sarah Paradis tweeted, “Wau <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly apologised for MacDonald’s remarks: “We apologise for the comment about the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this has happened."
CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued its apologies to more than 90 other tweeters’ comments complaining about MacDonald’s speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they were broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers last night, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the record, Byron’s comments related to the swimmer’s performance, not to him personally.
Nonetheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron deeply regrets what he said."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his regrets in the broadcast and tried to justify his speeches by saying that he did not mean it to be personal.
"I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's communication swim," MacDonald said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Needless to say, I didn’t mean anything degrading in my words, and I’m very sorry.”
In Primark, a woman who unblocked lingerie in the middle of a shop shocked customers
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman stripped in the middle of Primark to fit her underwear.
He made the situation worse by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually tried out four pairs of underwear at a shop at the Bouverie Place in Folkestone.
Primark chain shop at Folkestone’s Bouverie Place where a woman tried on underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two at the same time, says that after trying on lingerie, an unfamiliar woman dressed herself and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He said, “People couldn’t believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the shop, took her underpants off the shelf, took off her own shirt and underpants and put them on.
He did not try to do it discreetly, but did it without any shame.
Everyone was staring at him as he took off the underwear he had tried, and apparently he didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn’t like them, got dressed and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about the looks—and he didn’t think about the person who would eventually buy the underpants he’d tried on.”
Davidson, a 33-year-old living in Kent Town, continues: “How disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has worn and hasn’t washed.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
“I understand that the store staff tried to remove the clothes after the woman left – which is right.
It would be terrible to take your new underpants home and find that someone else has tried them on without washing them afterwards,” adds Davidson.
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the situation in its Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from sale.”
How to defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Grand Master Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Association in New York and asked for advice on how to cope with a robber or assaulter waving a gun at close range.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against an attacker, depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or from behind.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing to do is to turn around to see the attacker and get off the shooting line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your elbow and upper arm and hit the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker with his knee in the groin, and when he goes in pain twice, slap him in the face with the barrel of the gun and retreat by holding the gun pointed at him.
The technique is similar if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You need to move away from the shooting line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and hit the attacker with your fist in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun aimed at the attacker.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of a robber is to hand over your cash – unless you’re the Grand Master of Krav Maga.
World traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and his choking reflex to the test by licking the dirtiest and most repulsive places in Europe.
The Suffolk host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his strength of resistance by licking the euro banknote, handrail in Piccadilly Circus, the toilet flush button on the train and a Russian public telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects on a luminometer to see for himself and to show the viewers where his tongue was pushing.
The experiment was made into a documentary film about Ian Wright’s Inner Power, and the results were surprising.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train toilet may be disgusting, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals on how to confirm good bacteria in the gut and on his own health.
Luckily, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad taste in his mouth.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel program, where he tested his gut endurance by traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
The licking of railroad handrails and toilet flush buttons undoubtedly challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the documentary, "I've been pretty carefree about my health since I was a kid, and I've been putting things in my mouth, like dirt, worms, and mud."
In the film, he proved himself worthy of his reputation.
The border was only met in a filthy public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample.
For comparison, the number in newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border was met in a Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to lick, when a luminometer measured 4,000 units – the same number in newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright adventures in the documentary film Ian Wright – Intrinsic Power, produced with Valio, where the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom, is made visible.
Wright says in the documentary: "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright – Tracing Inner Power in collaboration with Valio.
From Valio Wright received Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut’s good bacterial strain and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of category for Valio’s snack, juice and novelty products, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time inventing something crazy, and eventually we came up with the idea of asking Ian to come along.”
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
“Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a broader context and tell you about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The movie also tells us about our sense of humor!”
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say I would have lost respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, licking some items was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licks on tape."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of the respondents attributed lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said that they used products with lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Disrupted family destroys city-owned apartment building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family left behind <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 of damage to the city’s tenements after they were evicted due to terror in the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forcibly removed from the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company said in shock that the apartment was undergoing renovation.
There were gaping holes in the walls, the floorboards were torn off, the debris was spread on the floors and the walls were stained with graffiti.
The couple has now moved and is believed to be living in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, said she feared the apartment could no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a complete nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is a lot to consider, as the property is likely to become known as a less pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, just like its name.”
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to police, the family’s tyranny included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use and transmission, and loud shouting, quarreling and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received an anti-social behaviour order in June.
In several rooms of the house under threat of demolition, old waste was found.
In the past, drugs had been sold from the house, and floorboards had been torn apart.
Neighbors said the family was fighting on the street and the police had to call regularly.
Cornwall’s Housing Agency forcibly expelled the couple this week after giving them an additional 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction —they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors said, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door for 20 years, and that whole time has been hard.
The police have been here an incredible number of times.”
“This morning we couldn’t sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of enforcement at the Cornwall Housing Agency, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were called in regularly.
Trash and old toys had been thrown on the wild wall of the rented house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, as eviction is always the last measure to be considered by the Cornwall Housing Agency.
This case was very difficult, as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking for the neighborhood to watch.
I am grateful to my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and community members who took part in the work and offered courageously to provide us with information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated."
Fitzpatrick reports that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
Dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Housing workers now have to clean out the garbage heaps around the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other supplies, as well as <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for being found guilty of possession of a Class B drug with the intention of selling it.
He claimed the money was for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband are reported to have moved to a private home in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were stained with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding evictions for tenants who violate lease rules.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police Department says this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they want without charge, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior," Crow says.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and anti-social behavior, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying, beach-like military jet frightens tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion crashed at a stunningly low altitude.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows a moment when tourists were panicked when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army plane comes close to touching the sandy beach with tourists sunbathing in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers got up on their feet, understandably worried about the jet engines that started to sound before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the people who shot the dramatic by-pass and posted videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, “It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing down.”
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would crash on me."
The tourists on Aveiro Beach were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a staggeringly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which required the plane to fly at such a low level.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires impeded visibility, but the Air Force said this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that due to heavy fog and poor visibility caused by smoke, the pilot had to fly at such a low level.
The aircraft was on a training flight, during which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Eksote's first half of the year results better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made a better result than planned in January - June by EUR 3.4 million.
Eksote's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has made it possible to dismantle institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the action queues.
The exote covers a previously created deficit with a surplus.
What is left over may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Eksote Board will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border guards have sworn a military oath in Immola
The 70 officers of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military casting ceremony for the guards of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The tenth special border striker course was held at the garrison’s sports field.
A 70-year-old soldier was sworn in.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border management, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special border guards.
250 of them were invited to the exams.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces during the war were involved in the veteran meeting.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
A bit of robbery ahead - criminal intelligence helps in the investigation of crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has had a criminal intelligence and analysis unit (RTA).
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
In the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by a sergeant stationed in the Bay.
The Chief of Staff is the Inspector in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
They all work in civilian clothes.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
It has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to make it less common for the police to go to the swamps only when they receive an alarm.
With the help of information collected and analysed by the unit, day-to-day police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, with less than three national units and a separate criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR centre, which operates in connection with the Central Crime Police in Vantaa, manages its operations nationwide.
According to their name, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Inquiry extends beyond your own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is the task of the RTA unit to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one’s own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, an alert task database and observations, the unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
A handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method, a certain image of the author is formed.
Serialization can be done either on the basis of the method of the act or on the basis of the person, depending on which of the police has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not completely public.
The methods used by both criminals and themselves are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities in order to prevent police efforts to combat crime.
The police will announce the methods publicly if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the way in which empty dwellings were marked, which was reported in early summer, in apartment burglaries.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin, or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were really traveling.
The preliminary investigation material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest people order the minutes of the district court, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, the thieves go with their gloves on.
Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppää from the Häme Police Department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärve from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department have been interviewed for the case.
The police collect and analyze information that is used to plan practical activities.
Against the background of the decrease in labour and financial volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was a three-step reform of PORA, which ended at the end of 2013.
National co-operation gathers information from outside the borders of the institution and Finland.
London Schoolgirl Joined by ISIS Killed in Syria
One of the three British schoolchildren who joined IS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the girl’s family had heard that Sultana had died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the ISIS base in Syria, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, was planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and testament so that people will understand that this is a real risk when entering a war zone – and that it will make people give up on the decision to leave,” says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana boarded a plane to Turkey with two other East London schoolgirls and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and had been widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland’s appointment to the Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Republican Senators have refused to confirm Garland's nomination since he was appointed by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose the person to fill the post of the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a teleconference on Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland with “relatively high confidence.”
Reid’s spokesman later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton about whether she was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton’s team didn’t want to “swing the boat” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Reid says the Republicans blocking Garland's appointment are "commands" and "assistants" to Presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars belong to women as well as men
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and launches a 1970s-style calendar inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of celebrity secret models, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his nudity-ridden magazine is different from the old-school Playboy magazines because, according to him, “Playboy is for men.
I do this to women.”
Apparently, he thinks the same about the calendar.
“We need to bring back a timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, can enjoy and be inspired by these images that praise the female body without the hassle,” Shaw said in a press release.
"Women will definitely want to participate in this project, because it will be a beautiful work of art."
Those wishing to use the calendar as a template can post their photos online or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The charm of vinyl: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you can write your angry objection in the comments section under the nickname NotAllLonelyMen of Middle Ages, this statement is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov research company, the much-discussed new arrival of vinyl records is not the result of a millennial-generation boom, when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead is the result of middle-aged nostalgia.
A person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, people between the ages of 18 and 24 are the least likely buyers.
It’s also not just the hobbyists’ desire to get records, but the significance is emotional: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to hide their emotions (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results correct?
If this blog were a TV newscast, the camera would follow me as I walk along the lively Soho Street, wearing a jewelless gray suit. I would lively, bend my hand to a cup and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
While Soho has slowly lost its charm and roughness as hotels, Eats, Prets, and Paperchase chains have taken over former privately owned spaces, there are still a handful of specialty record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment as I look very close to the men visiting these shops and try to assess their age and temperament by observing.
Stuart, 55, Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (at the time two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (at the time eight middle-aged men, one probably 20-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spends his extra time exploring the shops.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These boards fill her living room wall, as you can see from the photo. (Stuart sent me the photo by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly due to his disposable income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared, and re-buy things that he had had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I get a lot of late '60s and early '70s stuff that popped up when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get it," she says.
He agrees that people who buy vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds, “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed a new kind of flow of people affected by media hype. These people have heard about the re-entry of vinyl records and now feel compelled to buy back their old records.
"Based on my conversations, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
"Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he said.
This may explain the boom in vinyl arousal at a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the recordings?
In just a few seconds, a movement like Phonica realizes that they provide a comforting community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
The digital world may dazzle some vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar record cases means permanence and reminds them of the happy days of their youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a gap or acquires material possessions for some kind of consolation," says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I think so many others.
It’s an easy way to get your mind off.”
"We're like social workers!" whispered Wez's colleague from behind the pile of records.
An ICM poll conducted in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The poll also found that 41% of people have a turntable that they never use, and 7% of those who buy a vinyl record do not have a turntable at all.
At this point in the newscast, I would probably show a serious face while looking at stacked bossa nova collections.
The re-entry of the vinyl albums is also accompanied by the "pokal phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, a salesman for the Sounds of the Universe (currently three middle-aged men).
"A customer recently came to the store and said he doesn't have a turntable, but he wants to buy a Radiohead disc so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny said.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don't have a record player yet.
They’re younger, not older, mostly teenagers who’re just starting a hobby.”
The customer base is much more varied at Foppi, where I'll be arriving next. The shop has dedicated a whole layer to the vinyls.
The guests include seventy-something couples, photo-taking tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers is delighted, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous stores: instead of rocking jazz, the newest sex-filled synthesizer pop from Wild Beasts is from the speakers.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect a nagging psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and watching various discs on sale.
He's more interested in watching than in shopping.
He says his income is low, so it is not possible for him to collect records.
“They cost a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from the computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine is ...”, he sighs and continues:
"I can't explain it, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would imagine jumping in jeans shorts, but instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a while. I see a father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley disc player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key records for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just a decorative element and some are so high that you can’t even reach them.
They are pure "art vinyl" interiors.
But considering that any way to get attention to these records might mean more money for the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little to complain about.
It’s no surprise that the population group most likely to have more time and money than most is also the group that spends the most money on luxuries like vinyl records.
While my research shows that YouGov’s results are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they don’t rule out a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
They certainly won’t spend their Thursday mornings snorting at Berwick Street record stores, browsing through records, and avoiding a 30-year-old television host staring at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest-living vertebrate – video report
According to scientists, the longest living vertebrate on Earth is the ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest shark in the study was between 272 and 512 years old —a female of five metres in length.
French court rejects application for dismantling of jungle camp
A French court has rejected an application from the Calais authorities demanding the dismantling of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
During the trial this week, Calais authorities raised claims that the state should be allowed to break up 72 temporary stores in a refugee camp, which sell people in the refugee camp various items, ranging from tobacco to energy drinks, and offer haircuts, and that temporary restaurants can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to the prefects of Calais, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because of the fire and hygiene risks involved.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants were essential for the camp, as the free meals offered by the state-sponsored organization and others were not enough for the camp’s ever-growing population.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expulsion of 72 temporary dealers, but considered the concerns of the prefect of Calais "fully understandable".
According to Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla, the camp's grocery stores, cafes and restaurants are of far greater importance than just providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says they provide peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the sites under threat of dismantling was the Jungle Book Kids Cafe, a non-profit that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum advice to the camp’s hundreds of unaccompanied minors who are in the most vulnerable position.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition requiring the children's cafe to be preserved.
According to a letter to the Guardian, its closure “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
The two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, said Friday that after a sharp increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has reached a record 9,000 people.
Food prices in Finland fall significantly faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are drastically lowering to the delight of consumers and to the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries the price of food fell by 0.9 per cent on average.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food has fallen the second most in Finland in those EU countries that have the same wage level as Finland.
In comparison, only in the UK the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article by Statistics Finland’s Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then came a turnaround, after which food has become cheaper every year.
The price is now weighed down by Russia’s bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” says Lehtinen.
Intensified price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as a spectacular advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not a place of cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food in Finland was the fourth most expensive of the EU countries, which had a wage level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the comparator countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the same level as the old EU countries when it comes to food prices, we need to halve VAT to the EU average and continue to compete on prices," Lehtinen writes.
Mr Lehtinen points out that his calculations of the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
When you return to school, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced in all primary schools at the beginning of the semester.
This is the rule that all schools in Finland operate.
The details are decided by the schools themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New guidelines have been being prepared for several years, and they differ from the old ones in many ways.
For example, learning to write fiction will be abandoned, and instead, coding will be practiced in schools.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social studies begins at the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
In the past, it was thought that a teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make schooling more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found: Ice shark can live up to 400 years
At least the known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until he is 150 years old.
It may live for another 250 years, according to a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrates in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, only the Icelandic clam, whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507 years old, bypasses it.
Greenland sharks swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch longer than the males, they can grow up to more than five meters long.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to the surveys, only about a centimeter per year, adult individuals have been forcibly living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon timing of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-inch amazone mammals, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that glacial females only reach sexual maturity when they are more than four metres in length, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at this stage.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann is fired to nearly 300 – no sales cuts
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the troubled company ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs will be cut, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of retailers will not be reduced so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, some 80 employees of the support functions are offered new jobs as a salesperson.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
When they started, the need for reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The aim of the demographic reduction is to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised in the course of next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme that aims to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in making the department store profitable are behind this.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store transaction is still making losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Managing Director of Stockmann, the sales in the department stores have not reached the targets set by the company.
"Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure a positive operating result for Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The result improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best-ever second-quarter net sales and results.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group had a loss of EUR 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales this year will decline from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather on a rainy Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona L<0xC3><0xA1>ng.
There will also be rain showers in the central parts of the country, but there will be troughs to the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees.
Kenya athletics team is shaken by doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's rap
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah performed as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The athlete that Anzrah tried to play is the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Kenya national team leader Stephen Arap Soi said Anzrah’s identity had been revealed after he had given a sample as Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials reported to the Anzrah authorities.
Anzrah was sent home “for committing a crime against the Kenyan national team.”
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kenyan Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino told Reuters.
The Olympic athletics starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is one of Rio’s favourite winners.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah travelled with the athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officers confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him to a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he feared they would be exposed,” the source said.
Where's everybody?
Rio’s athletics stadium is empty
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio to watch athletics.
The competition for athletic medals started in Rio on Friday, but the world’s top athletes were able to show off their skills to a confusingly empty spectator.
Rio organizers said Friday that only 58 percent of the first-day morning and 65 percent of the evening tickets had been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was buzzing with cheerleading crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The loss of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
Thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding, for example.
When Brazilian medallists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the grandstand was full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only about 30 per cent of the 12,000 seats were filled.
The bad sales are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is far away for European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not able to complete the stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the organisers, said that 82% of tickets had been sold at the time, a much lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost nearly half as much as those in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio, this has not yet been allowed because the organizers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for lesser-known sports such as golf and rugby.
Rio Stadium was full of empty seats in the morning.
Not even the beach volleyball on the Copacaban sand has interested the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private individuals, companies and entities can use the money to claim ownership rights in the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of ownership for a fee.
The holder will have the right to veto its 187 square meter block, which means that in practice, not every holder will need approval if the use of the land is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
Acquisition of the right of domination is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or a gift.
You don’t have to go carrying banners or shackle yourself somewhere to protect nature,” Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired control of his company, explains.
The owner of the block receives precise location information from the block, which makes it possible, for example, to visit the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of the holders of the rights appear on the same map where the land block information can be found.
Leviäkangas sees the risk of its procurement of nature conservation as only that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation was established as a non-profit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation would operate in some way unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be left untouched and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of proprietors' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims beyond Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square from 13 to 19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turku the most in big cities - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torture Turku the most in Finland’s big cities.
This year, more bicycles have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the other nine major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat determined, based on the reported bike thefts, how many bicycles and bicycle parts per thousand inhabitants were stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police, there were four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
That's a big difference.
"In some cities, there are double the number of thefts relative to the number of inhabitants," says Police Inspector Tommi Reen of the Police Board.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is very difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The prevalence of thefts can be affected by how much people move around the city on wheels and how many bikes there are," says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in the comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts depends largely on the number of study and cycling towns.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and lots of bikes for thieves.
"Estonia, for example, is a completely different type of city, where city centres are far from each other and a bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, slightly fewer bike thefts have been reported to the police in January-August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police report slightly more than 20,000 bike thefts each year.
That means 50-60 fillers every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They're big," Reen says.
In reality, thieves steal more bikes, as only a part of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a crime report for bike theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are discovered.
A typical solved bike theft is one in which the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in the blood.
"Cases are also discovered in connection with other investigations, for example, when a drug case may contain stolen bikes in an apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or during a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from bicycle racks, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars in shopping centres, i.e. virtually everywhere they are normally stored.
As in previous years, most of the individual bike models are stolen from Jopo.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
For example, some thieves take a bike for short-term use, but a large proportion of the stolen bikes end up for sale, for example, via the internet.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the attention of the police that stolen bikes go abroad very much," Reen said.
According to police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a concealment crime or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if a good bike is sold at a clearly lower price," Reen says.
Special library clerk Severi Hirvi always carries his colourful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He's had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, says Moose. "He's never been taken, he's been a good monk in that regard."
"Perhaps this isn't so attractive to thieves, it doesn't necessarily have hipster value," Hirvi says.
Siiri Valve, who had a quick visit to a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike nodded against the wall of the kiosk, but Valve usually locks its bike in something solid, such as a bicycle rack.
"It's going to be a lot of thought, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about her white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
“You keep hearing from your friends that bikes have been stolen.”
"Mostly bad bikes, such smurf-Jops."
A bicycle was stolen from the house owner a year ago.
However, the bike was unlocked, so Valve was waiting to seize it.
Under 15-year-olds to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki to test US-famous peer-to-peer wrestling crews
In Helsinki, a so-called peer-to-peer jury is being tested to prevent young people from becoming involved in a criminal spiral.
Initially, the experiment will apply to children under 15 years of age, who will now be exempt from criminal liability.
The jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the perpetrator and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator can join a peer-to-peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Youth Executive Director Tommi Laitio says the model is not strict.
We have other conciliation models that are used side by side.
“Everything is directed towards a more responsible way for a young person so that not everything is ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
The peer-to-peer team has taken a model from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young person does not face an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with people of about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, service designer at the service design agency Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault, which was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes committed by people under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It has been a message that you should continue on the path you chose," Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, backed by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to all those in need, not just immigrant young people.
More than 70 Republican Influencers Want Party to Stop Funding Trump Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter calling on the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, which had received a sketch of it.
The letter is addressed to President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to be channelled into congressional elections instead of Trump’s campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his negligence, incompetence and record-breaking dislike threaten to bring a wave of vote to the Democrats in this election," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are declining day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from “people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress” and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials said in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton pledges relief for U.S. families with children
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced details of her economic policy on Thursday.
I am running for president so that the U.S. economy is doing well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy will go well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a statement.
At the heart of the Clinton Plan is a massive <0x24>275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure — roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a handshake for the American Dunarits, who are suffering as factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We are the builder people, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to ease the situation of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he insisted that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States to become a tax fugitive, it will have to pay departure tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the free trade agreement in the Pacific, which he previously supported.
"As President, I am opposed to any trade deal that works against workers or wages," Clinton said.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program that Republican Donald Trump announced on Monday that it “favors only this kind of millionaires.”
Trump’s proposed cut in corporate taxes, Clinton has previously called Trump “a loophole.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded audiences of small business owners whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
These are Rio’s ratings: The competitions have not glued the Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions appear as sharp mountain peaks in TV viewing statistics.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached huge numbers of spectators.
At one time, the games have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens at best: on Tuesday evening, the swimming was followed by 615,000 viewers from Yle’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparison: the European Championships in athletics one month ago attracted almost 800,000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships attracted well over a million viewers.
The most interesting Olympic sports so far have been cycling on Sunday evening and gymnastics that opened the fifth day of the competition, both of which reached almost half a million spectators at a time.
Sports manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the number of spectators and reminds that for the first time at the Rio Olympics, spectators will be divided into several instruments.
In addition to television, Finns are watching the Olympics in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the proportion of TV viewers who choose the Olympics in general.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympic Games in Rio are the first sports competition to which Yle has dedicated a whole channel.
When it comes 24 hours a day, and there are 20,000 to 500,000 viewers all the time, that’s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s broadcasts come to Finland at night.
Another reason for the weak interest - if anyone considers it to be weak - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the opening competition, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other sports of Finnish interest: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When athletics starts, the ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the Games on the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I guess we're already about 200,000 chargers.
"We will not get the network's ratings until later," Pokkinen says.
The Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the defects have been corrected.
The use of the Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been received, which should correct the errors.
The Olympic Games in Rio appear on Yle’s canals and in the arena more extensively than any other sporting event ever before.
You can watch some sports on the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Speech broadcasts competitions every day.
The Olympic Games are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only from Yle’s channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports will be shown on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which is 95.3 metres deep in Risinselkä.
It might be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found about 20 square meters of deflection in Ristiselkä, the depth of which was shown by the dive computer to be 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by echo-probeing.
The method does not necessarily find a small recess in a hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Lake Saimaa, Lake Toisvesi and Lake Pääjärvi reach more than 80 metres.
They haven't been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been accurately mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela wonders.
If the deepest lake is determined by the average depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
When viewed this way, Päijänne does not reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the top.
Correction 12 August at 14:29: The last paragraph where the deepest lakes were wrong was corrected.
Ihalainen on tax cuts: Taxes on pensioners still tighter
Taxes on pensioners are still tighter than those on employees.
Ihalainen says that the complaint was raised in the run-up to the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal with that of wage and salary earners.
The government’s proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises given should be kept after the elections, he says to Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received reductions in their income, which reduced taxation.
The matter was warmed up in Parliament by opposition representatives, who cheered the then Finance Minister Alexander Stubb on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, in the policy on tax reductions presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Econ.), it is mainly a question of safeguarding purchasing power rather than increasing it, as next year wages will not be raised.
He says tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s insecurity.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages from Prime Minister Juha Sipilä and Orpo about their willingness to honour the hard-won competitiveness agreement.
He says that keeping to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be undermined by questioning.
This will be necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people’s own belief in the future.
Prolonged Unemployment on the Barrier
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget debate, at least to stop its growth.
There were approximately 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in attacks in Thailand
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finnish time.
The embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and avoid the most busy tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the embassy for caution, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish Thailand travel season dates to the turn of the year.
The vast majority of tourists from Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finnish residents in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to get information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador thinks that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand’s divided society and last week’s referendum on a military junta constitution.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, an ethnic-national conflict over the Muslim population is brewing, Westphalen said.
Muslims want more self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks will affect the course of the day so that the authorities will be very careful about security.
Thai police say attacks are not about international terrorism
According to police, the attacks are “local sabotage” and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police said.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand in 24 hours after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including in tourist-loved Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded at night on a holiday island in Phuket, which is also popular among Finnish tourists, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was wounded.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded in Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination.
At least one person was killed in both double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and the city of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists, as it is used to travel to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the Thai military junta, said the attackers were not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic any more, he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators had intended to destroy the country’s tourism because all the attacks had taken place in tourist areas.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the large dispatch office for caution,” Westphalen says.
Vulnerable Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the Finnish night and the victims.
We have received a bit more information about last night’s attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the second attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
Surat Thani's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the provincial governor.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
The police chief, who was interviewed by CNN, said that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Thani, which detonated every half an hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quarter-final
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for scaffolding titles in Rio with platform, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to the best of his ability over the last few years.
He has won eight personal world championships in the previous three seasons.
He has won the quarter-final and permanto championships three times in a row, and last year and the year before.
In the U.S. team, Biles has won two World Championships.
The lighter World Cup medals Biles has a jump and a boom.
Thai entrepreneur: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency and a children’s play club in Phuket, Thailand, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don’t think that this will result in anything more amazing,” Huovila, who has been working as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years, says.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies near Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then there was a bird flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If they haven’t expelled tourists, this is hardly the case.
The Huovila company’s office is located a few hundred meters away from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about 9 a.m. local time and said that it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere in Patong was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
On the beach, many had never even heard of the attacks.
At half past three o’clock in the day, traffic in Patong had normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila, who visited the site, says.
The car was later seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
The patrol found two men with symbols hiding in a nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately arrested.
One ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of motor vehicle theft, theft and serious harm.
The police thanked those who gave the clues.
Research Director on Russia’s leadership change: Clearly set aside
Russia’s highest-ranking change in leadership in years was made on Friday, when President Vladimir Putin sacked the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is a former diplomat and served as Ivanov's second man.
“The reason for Ivanov’s expulsion may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that the recycling of leadership roles is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov may have had trouble with other leaders or may have screwed up.
Station drop at Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s inner circle, will take on special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer and proposed to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
In Russia, environmental and transport issues are not very high on the agenda.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but was elected president by Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guards, such as governors, have recently been exchanged in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place that Putin changes his immediate circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters use civilians as human shield in Syria
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them,” said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were deployed in hundreds of cars in which they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish militants seized about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to IS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we erroneously reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, ISIS fighters abducted civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: Ministry of the Interior’s document publicity policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office and the fact that the information had been recorded in the minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry’s Communications Director tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt has been running against time.
He was injured in the early season and had to skip the Olympics in Jamaica.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
“I’ve been practicing well and that’s the key,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and fan-turned journalists.
Porina around Bolt underlines the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the 2004 Summer Olympics was in Athens, where he was eliminated in the 200-meter increments at a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, shattering the world record and competitor self-confidence in the time of 9.69.
It's harder.
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the peak of his career by measuring the clock.
The world records of 9.58 metres and 19.19 metres in Berlin are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-metre world record and a 19-second record, but no one believes in it except Bolt himself.
One of Bolt’s biggest challenges is Justin Gatlin, the Olympic champion of 2004.
In the Beijing World Cup final last year, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt hasn’t lost a single time in the finals, if he’s ever made it.
In Daegu, Bolt missed the <0x24>100 World Cup final in 2011 due to a fraudulent start.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He's an old man in the young men's league, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year’s World Cup in London as his final goal.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But whenever I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
Chinese state news agency Xinhua said Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, had given a positive doping test at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping test found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping test on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the epo hormone.
She finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100m butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has filed his doping case with the International Court of Appeals for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua says evidence of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide was found in a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday.
There are also other suspected doping incidents in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the hormone epo.
Kenya has sent an athletics coach home from Rio for doping.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete and had given a doping test for him.
According to media reports, it is the Kenyan runner John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-meter Ferguson Rotich race pass.
There's nothing to stop Phelps - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam his 22nd Olympic victory in a 200-metre men's tournament in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold in the same sport in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps's winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second before Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, the BBC's Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton is laughing in the evening magazine's quick interview.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t stress much if there’s a little noise on social media or in the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he said.
Skelton wears high-heeled shoes and a short dress that is sure to have at least enough revealingness - at least for the eyes of many conservative British spectators.
There are no hindsights, however.
It's important to look good, and small arguments are just a funny thing.
Skelton is sure to want to frighten you, and maybe even startle you, but he insists he doesn’t want to be in the lead.
It’s not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn’t matter how I dress.
Can you imagine the turmoil reaching all the way to Finland?
I can’t, but all that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay with me, Skelton grinning.
You know what, man?
It's a fuss from nothing, if it comes from dressing up (the presenter).
I'm a little amused if this one hits someone's radar.
Rio Police Arrested Two Due to Terrorist Suspects
The Rio Police Department said on Thursday it had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The police arrested him during the security inspections.
At the same time, police arrested five others and questioned two people before they were released.
All the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that police arrested in July.
The detainees are believed to have links to ISIS.
The detainees were reported to have incited violence on social media.
Violent messages had been circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police detonate a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first-team game in the empty hall of the Rio basketball tournament on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed it to the public.
The police let the public in after they had detonated the package in a controlled manner.
This is the third time since the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled blast mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public was allowed to enter after the police had detonated the package in a controlled manner.
The audience did not make it to the auditorium by the start of the match, as the police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police detonated the package and let the public into the hall only after that.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that started the race sleepily.
With two defeats, Spain defeated Nigeria with 96-87.
In the last two races, Spain won silver.
The police carried out a controlled detonation mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last Saturday, police had to blow up a suspicious find near the road cycling finish.
Spain and Nigeria started their first-team matches of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty spectators.
Argentine lady slaps Petäjä-Siren - Finn reflects on protest
Wind Petäjä-Sireni had a colorful race day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a hard time on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady kissed Tuuli Petäjä-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening of the women’s surfing day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He got stuck in a car accident, and the others escaped, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete had long considered protesting.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund,” Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
After the crash, the Finn was ranked 27th.
The London 2012 Olympic silver medallist is the eighth overall.
The car accident did not have much effect.
Friday is an important day, when we have race departures from 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Unusual Things That Scientifically Extend Your Life
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to add years to a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life gets longer.
Sometimes, things that a person has no control over can add years to his life.
These include, for example, a predisposition to core obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don’t always have to worry, just picking up a can of milk is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored through various studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all of these things can lead to more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “reduced risk of death,” especially from neurological or cardiac diseases.
Studies have shown that moderate consumption -- from one to three daily doses -- can prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who didn’t drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can prolong a person’s life by more than six years, according to one study.
This claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can also contribute to the spread of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected a person’s lifespan.
The project, which lasted seven years, was monitored by more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years in his life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings additional years, there is no denying that.
However, reaching longevity does not require unconditional solidity.
A study from the University of Oxford found that women with a big butt had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it’s an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bun.
Many studies have attempted to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his or her life.
On the other hand, some researchers suspect that longevity is due to a person's social status - which in turn makes it possible to pursue recognitions such as the Nobel Prize, for example.
A study of the shopping behaviour of people over 65 found that people who shop daily are less likely to live as parents who shop.
This is because rotating in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may precipitate death.
So count your credit card from your hand - online shopping will not have the same effect.
Drunk driver crashed into truck
On Friday evening, a serious frontal collision between a truck and a passenger car took place in Kotke, Southwest Finland.
The accident occurred in the middle of Koskikentie and Sorvastonttie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when the passenger car on the way had run into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck stood upright in its lane, but caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The car fell into the ditch and then over the ditch onto the roof.
A woman, born in 1972, who was driving a car, was squeezed into her car.
Rescue services removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to the Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The woman's breath test score was 2.02 promille.
He's suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Posti sends candy to the wrong city
There were deficiencies in Salon K-Citymarket’s selection of bulk candies, because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the cargo to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was shopping for candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in the loose chocolates, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the cargo delivered!
Unless there was traffic in the lawn, the sign said.
The merchant’s foxing sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
Lawn mowing is available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
I was shocked by the popularity of the update.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention that has been drawn to this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favourites in a candy bag, even though a few larvae were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for Posti’s Corporate Transport Services business, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages went to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we did not go to make a partial delivery (Saloon) with three, but we only took five stages today,” Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomi.
This was first reported in the evening.
Teija Haltia was not angry with the sign, because she found all her own candy favourites in the selection.
Thirty pounds lighter Lotta Backlund posted a photo of her change
The comedian-producer has shrunk dozens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a life change.
Lotta shared a photo of her change on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aiming for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian and television producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss project in 2009.
He has a comprehensive lifestyle change and has slowly lost about thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of photos of his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund’s before and after photo pair has collected a number of praiseworthy comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous, aren't you?
We’re on the same road, motivation is strong!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I travel the same way, another says.
In the spring, Lotta lost the last few pounds with the Let's Do It Now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which was then ten kilograms away.
During the three-month period of fitness, the pounds eventually dropped to five.
The family wish of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Commemoration of the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered with a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and petitions.
Sipoo Veterinary Hospital has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked as a substitute at the veterinary clinic in Sipoo and also completed her nursing training there.
The vet remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous, and unafraid of work.
Dear friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbors told the newspaper that the victim was very fond of animals.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old suspect did not know the woman and had no connection.
The murderer was tracked down by police dog Börje, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Posti for violating the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise a temporary agency worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court ruled in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the withheld salary and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only a part of the instructor’s salary that corresponded to the share of the instructor’s work throughout the day.
According to the District Court, the employee was placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the decision of the Union of Postal and Logistics Industries PAU on the induction ban.
During the November Postal Strike last year, PAU made a decision that Posti employees would not familiarise themselves with temporary agency workers who violate the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalist Association.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Federation of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concerns about freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland has repeatedly highlighted to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
Putin sacked the head of his administration in place of the Estonian-born Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has sacked Sergei Ivanov, the head of the presidential administration, the Kremlin said.
Anton Vaino, grandson of the Communist leader of Soviet Estonia, Karl Vaino, will replace him.
He is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax said.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to the Kremlin's press release, Ivanov, a close-knit insider of Putin, will take on special tasks related to the environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a second assignment and suggested that the persecution be replaced, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB's espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to office in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's big buyout for ban - won't be seen in Premier League opening
The world record holder of football transfers is not seen on the field when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba was banned from playing in England.
Manchester United’s Paul Pogba is on the sidelines due to a ban on the opening of ManU’s league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
According to British media, ManU paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million for Pogba to Italian club Juventus.
However, the FA Football Association of England keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was under a ban from Juventus.
He received two warnings at last season’s Italian Cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
The ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next match will be in the league's second round on August 19, when ManU faces Southampton.
In Flow, greatness is a virtue.
Strict criteria and ambitious visions of enjoyment have established Flow Festival as an internationally respected event starring the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival goers have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival’s event area is decorated with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to just have a main stage and a beer tent,” says Artistic Director Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The question behind this success is simple: what kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It is quite different in the event production to think this way.
The goal is often to reach the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities,” says Artistic Director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 people by 5,000 last year.
This year, the festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because the activity has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle guided by huge passageways.
That's not what we want.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been swelled with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant and drink bars in the partially artificial grassed area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, a tent for 15,000 people will serve as a venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little magnificent, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work that has been done is that today even big visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki’s support of approximately 20,000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the company operating Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "cruise-like things", such as the construction of the 73-metre-wide tent.
Visitors to Flow have typically expressed themselves in distinctive clothing.
Alongside the music event, one can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event is not consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and a desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival, which combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's done damn good gigs in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flowerpots - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Since 1989, wildlife protector Edwin Wiek from Asia tweeted an eloquent picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the TV properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Shortly after that, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was also popular among Finns.
No one reportedly died.
At the same time, there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken a heated interest in the activities of criminal organisations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new preparedness forces will first go to battle in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are ordered to combat duties only after several months of swearing a military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the chief of training of the Finnish Defence Forces, who was interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are capable of fighting, for example, of conscripts serving 5.5 months in a war situation.
According to the Head of Training, first reservists will be assigned to the reservists.
No conscript or reservist is assigned to a task for which the required training has not been provided, Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer, it became clear that the Finnish Defence Forces would start training conscripts for the immediate readiness units starting next year.
Units may, if necessary, be used in military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola receives huge compensation from a mould house
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over an apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330,000.
However, after the transaction, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, which caused microbial vegetation that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in dismantling condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in court and in the court of appeal.
The court ruled on the matter on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the district court, which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 in price reductions.
In addition, the seller has to reimburse the couple’s litigation and settlement costs totalling EUR 47,344.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly, because the buyers had already known about the need to repair the apartment at the time of the purchase.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the defects in the construction were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a good home because they did not want to do the repairs.
He had come to the impression that the building had been renovated and in good condition, and that there was no harm from the elements mentioned in the condition check report.
The inspection report mentioned the risks and malfunctions of ventilation and the inadequate management of rainwater and meltwater flowing along the rock surface.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that there was any urgency.
Tola and Waroma maintained the idea that rainwater coming from the cliffs should perhaps be controlled a bit within a few years.
The transaction took place in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial vegetation in the building, which, according to witnesses, was caused by both rocky rainwater and capillary soil moisture.
On the western side of the house, the inspector estimated that the air contaminated by microbes could also enter indoors through the porch.
Mold or yeast exceeding the limit values, which poses a health risk, was found in brush samples in the utility room, the basement staircase, the windowsill in the living room and the washroom in the basement.
Terraces were built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been enlarged in violation of the building permit.
The court ruled that before the sale, Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision that changes had been made to the apartment contrary to the permit.
Among other things, terraces had been built, even though there were no proper permits yet.
However, home problems were a central issue in the court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma had no particular reason, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, to carry out a wider inspection than usual.
The buyers have not neglected their duty to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - also Finns on the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter that the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., has microfilmed records of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards are from the National Bureau of Breeding in Nazi Germany.
The National Board of Breeds operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of women, who were supposed to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were undergoing gynecological examinations to find out.
The National Board of Racial Affairs investigated women’s backgrounds by, among other things, examining church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to renounce their Swedish citizenship and give handwritten biographies and good recommendations from close relatives to the National Board of Breeding.
The racial agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving," "smart," and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The case does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program stipulated, among other things, that every SS man should have four children, either married or out of wedlock.
The Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the US Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and supporting children.
A German mother’s Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, according to the museum's website.
Sixth in Petäjä-Siren, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first race of Finnjollie’s day at the Olympic Games in Rio, but remained the top of the team’s tail in the second race of the day.
In the overall situation, he rose to eighth after five departures, but his failure to finish second dropped him to 14th place.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren took 17th and 3rd place in the RS:X class.
In total, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In 470, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the opening round.
In total, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: “I was so stunned”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite Finnish artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who has grown from the bartender of the cruise ship to the tango king of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dance stages and festivals, continues to thrive, and is currently in a state of extreme agitation.
Jari Sillanpää, a book by Mari Koppinen about the life of a favorite singer, was published today.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career rose to an absolute high when he won the crown of the Tango King at Seinäjoki Tangomarket in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a slightly different kind of music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The song Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape with a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so fucked up!
Sillanpää remembers in the book.
You wouldn’t immediately guess from recording a song that became a huge hit that was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the print was still good.
I learned that you don’t have to demand perfection and excellence all the time.
The second incident related to one of the most popular songs of the man, described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with his partner at the time, and the case eventually ended up in the lyrics for the song You Deserve Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record telling the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the separation were not true, instead it was written based on the news from 7 days magazine.
The newspaper reported that Jari and his ex-lover broke up because of Jari’s excessive partying and alcohol use, but Jari said it was complete nonsense and it wasn’t true.
Jari was furious with the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their empire out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the divorce and 48% would have stayed in the Union, even though polls during the voting week predict the opposite.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the separation, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of former U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid," flew to the ground in a UK Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics asks professionals for answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economists’ explanations for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's the right British.
Many people also have the impression that a decline in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist Party, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly struck by the BBC’s fairness, which allowed just a few percent of the economists in favour of the EU divergence as much room as the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested in explaining what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic capital letters think about the consequences of the split.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt, and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not think they have a common interest.
The academics of the big cities, like the economists, would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and in rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is an Economy
The overwhelming argument for victory in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant congests your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments work.
There are foreign workers in every cafeteria.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get doctors if they didn’t exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the children of the real British to get a place at school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners in every town.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer waiting lists for health centers and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK's public finances, and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepares for Brexit in Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, in Aberdeen, preparations for Brexit were made in time by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, more detailed preparations were made for Plan B, the victory of the EU-leaved camp, in case the result was a leave.
There was concern that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We're going to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says about Aberdeen’s only daily open-ended real estate fund that the news covered.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
At the time, the fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at or below 10%.
So the real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed the trade.
When the EU-leaning camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they robbed the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good situation because of the cash raised, but it also had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worth pulling out the money in a panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you don’t have to take your money out now, it’s not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and the majority withdrew the notification.
Since then it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in the Aberdeen Continental European Funds.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closures of real estate funds received unreasonable attention.
The open funds affected by the closures control about 4% of UK real estate.
The Aberdeen closure lasted six days and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its funds closed for the 2017 half of the year.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts are downgraded, but the situation does not seem "worse" for Aberdeen.
The main questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound/dollar exchange rate is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of buyers, he said.
Brexit brings down on London property market
At two o’clock in the morning, the situation didn’t look very good.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments at the UK’s Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word in your head.
I realized that this is now going to plan B,” Vanhanen says in her second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
The city of London was still alive in the morning.
The TV screens in the office, which were normally set to be silent, frustrated the news, and usually the noisy crowd quieted when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell them he was different.
When the market opened, the screens flashed only red.
It was a morning you never thought you could live, he said.
Not because Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, which is why the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit Vote Begins Correction
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership switched.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the UK real estate market, especially in London.
London office spaces were projected to have up to 20% downsides in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trades one after the other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not show its last summer holidays on the face of Vanhanen, who was in Helsinki this week.
It is too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference will occur and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first reported.
CBRE's data on price developments cover about a third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 percent from June to July.
In the City of London office buildings, a negative figure of 6.1 per cent was accumulated, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only in five months there have been worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All the same drops occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared to the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
Mr Vanhanen thinks that the comparison is not entirely appropriate, as this is a domestic crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different too.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like this at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is found normally.
The repair could have been done anyway.
In fact, he doesn’t think the price adjustment is a miracle – it could have happened without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that property prices in London and other top cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City and especially the offices are overpriced, Vanhanen says.
The fall started really high.
London’s prices have risen for four reasons, according to Vanhanen.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of property that is becoming globalized, Vanhanen says.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for profits in new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, price rises stabilised last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net salesman last year.
There was a turnaround, and now it came.
What about from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not dare to judge much of the future, but says that there is hardly any chance of a surge.
The atmosphere indicates that there is a descending or steady going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that you can work through the pits.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much of a victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S-Group starts registering purchase information more accurately than before
S Group knows what you are eating, as the retail group today announced that it will start collecting more accurate information about its loyal customers’ purchases.
When information on the total amount of the receipt has been collected so far, the group will begin to collect it at the beginning of May also from purchased products.
S Group will follow Kesko here, as data on the goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years already.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing purposes subject to consent.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomi.
According to him, Kesko will not react to the change in the registration of the S Group.
Kesko categorises its loyal customers into ten groups according to their grocery purchases alone.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and is not currently planned to do so.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Loyalty Program, which can be joined at Valintatalo, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product group level information, we remain at the level of the total receipt.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on which day and the total amount of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to the same level as K-Group or S-Group,” says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty program is planned to be renewed in the future, but the local store will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially an experiment
SOK’s customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic data also include the profession, education, form of residence, as well as the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the payment method are recorded from the S-Etukortti purchase.
In addition, the data of S-bonus partners have been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In S-markets, Prismo, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains, however, the data are recorded at product group level.
For a long time now, customers have had hopes that marketing could be targeted more closely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Ownership and Partnerships.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
They may object to the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored on the cash registers anyway, whether you like it or not.
The interested party can check their stored data on the S Group website.
For example, cash registers cannot access information, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs’ newest dog reinforcement – puppy becomes first explosive dog
A black labrador puppy sniffs vigorously at five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t be long before it sits resolutely next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing with his favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of gunpowder gas-smelling shells was discovered.
Gunpowder gas is the first odour that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Tull’s first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be assigned to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may take Heila and Sunti to other border crossings and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be the main place of work for Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures at Customs, and after the attacks, supervision has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
Another main reason for training a weapons and explosives dog for Customs’ tasks is the postal consignments passing through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increase in internet sales, up to 40 million mail items pass through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made about 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapons components, ammunition and explosives, as well as their precursors, among online purchases, luggage of passenger planes and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the hound, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio and Heila are also training with experts from the police and the Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport include Customs’ six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include flickering and hunting, as well as calmness, because the dog is involved in weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntie’s home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without a snail at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle commands go to Heila from a one-time lap.
The cameraman in the Evening Messages loses the camera mic cover for the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-looking cam cover immediately after the "delete" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still some proficiency tests ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding jobs.
You can see Heila on assignments at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes as planned.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron a dog wearing a work vest, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten years, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, ranging from eight to ten hours, but active work sessions only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a fierce competition for working dogs in Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied to become the owner of Heila.
Lucky hit Sunti, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and surveillance tasks in Tull.
Mini-state wins its first Olympic medal – people get a day off
Fiji’s Olympic gold in rugby, with a population of less than one million, is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
Fiji's public broadcaster said the Fiji government confirmed the case after the championship was settled.
The day off is the day after the team returns home.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country watched the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen was set up at the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheering," Maikele Seru, a Fiji Times reporter, told The Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish Buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kg after a tough fight.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted several times.
No one really knows why.
In Rio, Tokola was pushed to 175 kilograms and swept to 145 kilograms.
His total weight was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get his last push of 175 kilograms, as did his second.
At the third attempt, the weights rose, accompanied by a fierce roar.
The body was shaking under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The joy of the Finnish lifter was accompanied by the fact that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian forward Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Football Club has signed a long-term contract with the Estonian forward Albert Prosa until the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player with power and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through more than 50 players from all over the world with more than 10 player agents.
Little by little, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored 51 goals in 109 games.
He also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to accompany RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where Rovaniemi residents will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season’s Country King Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The gorgeous Modern Family star once again shouts: teenage star's shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, known as Alex Dunphy in the comedy series Modern Family, shows off her gorgeous body once again.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that leave little to the imagination.
Shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his buttocks.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behavior considerably bolder.
The star has posed in very few outfits in her social media photos and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce clothes.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has also recently posted several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
She has learned that the more she looks naked, the more publicity and attention she gets in Hollywood, Palmer told Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when she was only 11.
The actor has outraged some of his long-time fans with his image change.
“It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years’ time when the downturn is already so strong,” one woman on Winter’s Instagram post said.
Some of the women’s fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her to ignore criticism.
You look great!
It doesn't matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, glows a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the northern lights: in autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to entice the Japanese to start their Northern Lights journeys already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter travels, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
There is great demand for winter Northern Lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season begins early in the autumn and continues until late spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, in which the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the sight twice as fairytale, says Anne Lind, Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see clearer unique sights from Finland, and the Northern Lights have enormous potential here, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>183 a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby 7 after Fiji’s champion team won gold
The UK’s impressive success in the seven-player rugby match was crushing when Fiji defeated it in the final at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio on Thursday, 43–7.
Fiji taught the champions in ball handling, transfers, sideshows, support games, running lines and brutal force, winning gold – if it was the country’s first Olympic medal in its entire history.
The loss meant silver, which was a little bit more consolation for Britain, as it was the country's third silver on the same day. They can be proud of their success as an Olympic sport in the first-ever rugby 7 tournament, where the team defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A close 7–5 victory in the South African Boxing semi-finals earlier that day may have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, Fiji’s team in this form would have defeated the British even if the 15-member team had been in full strength.
It may be comforting for Britain that at least one British will be awarded a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, a former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It has been quite an experience for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all games in the Adelaide Sevens in Ryan's coaching.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Defeat hurts, but progress is staggering.
Fiji started out excellently and presented his tackling skills to the UK for fun.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had run into a group of moving buses, and the world champions took the lead 5–0 when Osea Kolinisau made a dive into the corner.
When there were four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
The score was 12-0, and the UK had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's spectacular tackle prevented Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it didn't slow Fiji for long.
After seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored a goal in the right corner, after which the UK lost 17–0.
Nakarawa scored a second goal in the first half, with more than a minute left.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvouou plunged through the more powerless tackles of the British team and plunged over the finish line.
The opening period ended with a score of 29–0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British were still in the game as apprentices.
Which is pretty much true.
The United Kingdom made extensive changes in the halftime and managed to hold back the Fidschi team for a full four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored a goal thanks to the excellent team play of the Fidschi team.
Dan Norton succeeded in narrowing the score to 36–7 by scoring the UK in the left-hand corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea archipelago, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the grandstand.
Fiji’s purely cheerful attitude was hard to ignore.
Mata Viliame finished the Fijian cake by scoring a goal at the last minute.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell on the pitch, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won Japan in the semi-finals by 20–5, and the UK had skipped South Africa in the tight semi-finals, where the match was solved by the UK goal kick.
Kyle Brown took the lead in the South African Boxers in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and plunged from under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15-player rugby player Anthony Watson, seals the victory and eventually the silver medal.
Coach’s battle against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
Gold couldn't be more emotional in this race.
From the first bet to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 winning bets into history and found an additional purpose for their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were two oarsmen, the third voice in the boat was the voice of coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to play their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's duo, making them the first women in British sports history to achieve a similar feat.
Their superiority was undeniable, their victory was already 39th in a row and once again a record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes joining the water surface like swans age, does not fully match the nature of success.
Behind every rowing gold is a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed towards the achievements of the two. However, the most important assistant is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who then did not know if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tough at the time.
“I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be removed.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the mindset a bit.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start their treatment outside the high season of the sport in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little inconvenience as possible, if you can say so now in conditions like this.
“I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around section 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's where it starts.
The rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger.”
Immediately after the win, the twins' thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and had spoken a little more than normal in an attempt to overcome their own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: “On a sentimental level, I have been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a little extreme, but it means so much.”
“It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we’ve worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years, Helen and Robin's cash register has been fantastic.
“Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anything, so a huge thank you to him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better person to train with, or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the last five years.
The duo have found an overwhelming rhythm that their rivals have not been able to match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
“We were so caught up in the moment.
Helen said, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It’s very important not to get off the track.”
“We were very successful in leaving, and at the same time we weren’t trying to do anything amazing.
We didn’t go for the skies today, we just wanted to do a good rowing and win the race we did.”
The two have a year to think about their future.
Next month, Glover will be celebrating his wedding with Steve Backshall.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
That would have put too much pressure.”
“After London it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to realize.
It feels so much better,” he says.
Iceland to change government plagued by Panama leaks
Iceland is holding an early parliamentary election in October, which was demanded by protesters raged by the Panama leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians evaded taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election day is now set for October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the rage of the people last spring will affect the election result in the autumn.
In the June presidential elections, criticism of those in power was clearly shown, and Gudni Johannesson, a non-political candidate, was elected president.
Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled his last speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would also be involved in the founding of the organization.
The Democratic Party was furious and demanded an apology from Trump.
“Nobody should ever be allowed to go down so low as a commander-in-chief,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the Muslim-favored use of a burkini swimsuit on beaches, according to the British newspaper The Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that it is forbidden to go to the beaches and swim for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which broadly expresses religious ties, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice after a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two ISIS-affiliated men attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest who was over 80 years old.
The quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed a sieve - Pyykösjärvi bluish algae clouding
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only at the Pyykösjärvi beach has blue-green algae decay been observed.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environment Department took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu Region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters were below the action limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococcus concentrations in Meriniemi beach water were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae sediment found at the Pyykösjärvi beach does not yet make the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue-green algae blooms, resulting in the formation of blue-green algae mass on the water surface.
The environmental action monitors the situation with frequent inspections.
If the bluish algae sediment turns into bluish algae blooms, this will also be announced separately on the beach notice board.
See the results of the bathing water here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance’s budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal for forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote the generational renewal of forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest farms and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational change of forest holdings is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Forestry Director of the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Mr Hakkarainen finds something to be criticised in the tax reform proposal.
A forest gift reduction is proposed for the forest owner’s clean capital income.
It is capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
In the opinion of MTK and Hakkarainen, the effect of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales result of the wood.
The proposal of the Ministry of Forestry starts from this, by making a deduction from the net capital income of forestry prevents that it would result in a loss in the capital income of forestry, which would be deductible in other taxes.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit even if he did not sell the wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
In the proposal, the tax deduction bound to the value of the forest is EUR 40,000.
It has been pulled too high in Hakkarainen's mind.
As such, according to him, 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners will be excluded from the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing the farm size.
In forest policy, forest gift reduction has been carried out for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A heavy hailstorm surprises drivers in Himanga - two cars crashed into a ditch and crashed into each other
The Himanga in Kalajoki had a special collision on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Board, two cars that were driven in a row escaped into a ditch, after which the driver in the rear collided with the driver in front.
According to on-call fire chief Harri Pyähtä, it is suspected that the descent into the ditch was caused by a heavy hailstorm.
There were two people in the back of the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident happened on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometres to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research by researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments to be more effective.
The findings of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research team show that the hardness of a cancer tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, it was possible to prevent the growth of cancer in laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing not only on cancer cells but also on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home killing continues in court, prosecutor demands murder sentence also for another perpetrator
The murder of Muhos family home continues in court for both convicted offenders.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for the murder of a family home in Muhos.
The second was sentenced to eight years and four months for murder and robbery committed as a young person.
The other is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of the killing was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of road safety as a young person and of transporting a vehicle without a right as a young person.
The District Court appealed against the judgment by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received a harsher sentence.
The prosecutor is demanding that a man with a lesser sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time.
According to the District Court, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as a director of a child welfare unit in a school in July last year.
The 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder allegedly attacked a director sitting from behind on a sofa in the living room.
The director had let go of the grip and led the young man to his room, when one of the youngsters hit him with a vacuum tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the mental state survey, both convicted offenders were fully understood at the time of the deed.
According to the court, the young people had planned to escape from the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrates in the world, growing only at the age of 156.
The world’s longest living vertebrate has been confirmed by an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark or holker can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156.
The life expectancy of an ice shark is increased by only one centimeter per year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists found out the age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The eldest was estimated to be 392 years old - though the throw in one direction or the other can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Wisdom - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
As much as a third of the state’s total tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump’s proposed change in corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease, especially with tax relief for the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
Corporate tax would be reduced from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount of money left uncollected, <0x24>1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump’s proposed reduction of 33 percent.
Inheritance tax would be abolished.
Trump blamed the state for over-regulation of business and bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on in a hurry must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Barack Obama’s health care reform needs to be revisited.
We need to appoint "experts" instead of "bureaucrats".
"Destructive" trade policy is one of the main causes of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements would be abolished.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty rate of 45% and those from Mexico to 35%.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers across the country.
Contrary to his habits, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by his assistants, despite the fact that it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists – including those close to the Republicans – see Trump’s program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her first show on Friday.
Tsunami from the past - People's News
The sea is turbulent, but the actual tsunami strikes in the middle of Madrid’s street turmoil – a reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var's novelty story.
Almodovar’s previous directing work Travel Lovers (2013) was a fun and rhombic satirical comedy, the predecessor of Iho, where I live (2011).
Julieta (2016) takes place somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene drama of love, relationships and family, with the mother-daughter relationship at its core.
The story is simple and seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be the same for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of an occasional encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be astounded until the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before the birth of his daughter, the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher from the TV series Time Between Ommelte (2013-2014), will be starring in the second female role.
Julieta’s aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a lump, but I would say it’s pretty funny and literally a one-time sweep.
There is a fair distance between Julieta and the often so characteristic blasphemy of Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var films, down to the humor.
It is an equally strong, discreet film, with good music in some places and quite sad, with elements of elegance as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of a Spanish director is still there, and it slowly starts to catch on as a pure form factor rather than a working dramatic effect.
People in the film suffer from illnesses, deaths, or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains just as cool.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a name person, the costumes change from scene to scene, and the same is true for eye-catching earrings.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the mechanics of the current scene, does not improve much on this.
When recurring mechanically, the impression is external and a bit unspiritual.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has written a manuscript based on three novels by Canadian author Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The novels have been published in the book Karkulainen: Stories.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly even literary filmization.
The material would have been emotionally incomparably strong for the drama, so much of the big stuff - especially the gnawing guilt - the theme of the movie deals with.
Written and directed by Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres on 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - People's News
No new cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the Finns in the Base will not collapse altogether.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be made in bulk.
There will be no further cuts.
The <0x24>4 billion savings already made are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Central) say during the budget meeting.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the proposal of the Ministry of Social Affairs, since the cuts in social security were already decided on in the spring spending limits session.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pension Index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Training cuts continue.
Municipal elections are haunted
Why are ministers so eager to emphasise precisely that no further cuts will be made on these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the result of the municipal elections, which leads the government parties in different directions, ruins the mood of the government for a long time.
However, the Gallup report that the Government Party expects the Finns to lose their cigarettes, even though the result of its previous elections was modest at 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, Perussuomalainen received 752 new delegates, most of whom will realize the price of influencing the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the government of three parties of approximately equal size depends on the ability of the Finns Party to endure.
Now it has not lasted, and more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the fermentation status of the parliamentary group of the party have also surfaced.
The 'no new cuts' rhetoric, on the one hand, obscures the fact that they will be done violently next year and, on the other hand, tries to soften the blow that is waiting for the Finns.
Big cuts in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set itself the goal of declining debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will take out <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the election, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt is not bending or even slowing down.
The second is to stick to the program.
That means even tougher cuts on top of the previous ones in the 2017 budget meeting.
The budget would be squeezed at least close to balance in 2018, and then in the spring, in the parliamentary elections, what comes next will be accepted.
With these measures, the debt will not be broken
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not bend, even if Juha Sipilä tries to incite a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki at the press conference on the budget prove this unmistakably:
The growth forecasts of the global economy have repeatedly proved to be overly optimistic, i.e. there will be no pull from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not risen much since the collapse in 2008, except during the temporary stimulus policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has lasted on average from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent by the middle of the next decade.
What is Responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, it will cost around six billion euros to maintain unemployment, which will in practice be covered entirely by taking out new debt.
This is the opinion of the Centre Party, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
Survey: We want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four believe that the organisation of childcare, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by TWO - The Municipality Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also delegates responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic schools, building supervision, upper secondary education and waste management.
The responsibility of the county is most clearly to be given to provincial planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities.
There is no desire to delegate any of the municipal tasks to the state.
Juvenile drunk driver flees police after chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran a police patrol in Joensuu on Friday night at half past one.
A police patrol attempted to stop a motorcycle that had not been lit, but the young man evaded the police at a reasonable speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantantie, from where it continued to Sorronahontie and to the smaller forest road where the motorcycle got out of the way.
After this, the young man ran away, but the faster-legged policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
A blow test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
A truck that was loaded with stones crashed into a ditch
A truck in a rock load crashed into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday evening at 21.15.
The truck had slid out of the road in a bend to the left and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver through a door above the crashed truck, along with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
It was up to the car owner to lift the vehicle.
The crashed truck spilled hydraulic oil on the road, which the rescue service absorbed into the peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki Lahdenkylä in southern Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman, about six feet tall, slim, and with white hair that extends under her chin.
Findings and clues about the missing person’s movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre’s hotline number 0295440513.
Elements of a major disaster in the air - see photo gallery of the devastation of Parafest
The flooding of Parafest’s tents caused massive damage.
The chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will recover financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed on the market stage at the end of Friday evening.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1 pm to 3 pm.
The program is arranged as planned.
The surge flow is generated in a thunderstorm cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a declining airflow.
Changes in the state of the thundercloud’s water bind heat, and thus the declining air mass cools down and accelerates its pace towards the ground.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
The trajectory of surges is difficult to predict.
The flooding hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where Parafest took place, on Friday afternoon before five o’clock.
Three of the tents fell over, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people slightly injured themselves in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported to further treatment with minor injuries.
Air pollution ages Londoners
Research shows that Londoners’ skin ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
According to the Evening Standard.
Caci, a British skin care company, analyzes the most toxic particles in London’s air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than the skin of, say, a peer living in rural areas.
The fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollutants that come from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk commuting near busy streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed, pushed man in front
The man had moved rocks in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor fell on the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor pushed him enough that he was transported to the central hospital for further investigation, seriously injured.
The tractor could not run any further, as it collided with the stones in front of it.
Renewed strength for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship League, will start the series in October from a better starting point than men’s memories.
The team has been together for three weeks now.
The common tone is sure to be found better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säis, who will continue as the head coach of Rienno, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni starts his second season in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwandan national team, is a 205-inch hacker.
Garchet is a passer-by, the Brazilian has a size of 198 cents.
Through Josban, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all of the indoor bandy world championships since 2003.
Now Tampere has its sixth competition, only 2013 was missed since Canada was better in the North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. formed the national football team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumpanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in Elizabeth, near New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such sport as floorball yet.
Sähly was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoki in Finnish Championships, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university in the Finnish Floorball Championship 1991-92, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls of the club for the championship.
Women’s Finnish Championships culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the Finnish Championships, with a balance of 51+34<0x3D>85 in 169 games.
The last season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen named to national team
Josban from Joensuu was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen from Enola was chosen to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Republic’s Brno EFT tournament on November 6-8.
25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men’s national games before this, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4<0x3D>13 points.
Tatu Väänänen, a 32-year-old defender from Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, has recovered from a thigh problem and is part of the national team’s standard fleet with 117 national matches.
Mika Kohonen was also named to the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Championships in December.
Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti is the head coach of the national team.
Beach volleyball player Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold is missing from the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volley Championships will be held at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
For three days, the medals will be played in both adult and adolescent series.
In cooperation with the Finnish Volleyball Federation and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the six best pairs of each series will qualify for the Finnish Volleyball Championship.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, raised by Elimäen NMKY, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volleyball team for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be on the lookout this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the Pesis Stadium.
I haven't played in the adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu says.
The Kouvola region lit a spark in Hasu’s sport and gave good food for a great hobby.
I have good memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 at Elimäki NMKY’s E-girls.
The top is too big a shirt, knee pads on the ankles and amazing ace screams and choreographies after the point,” Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was fun to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of the teammate coached us and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasu beach volleyball was already a natural choice during the junior season as a counterweight to indoor volleyball.
The beach of the curved pond has been played since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also watched the junior SM-tour competitions myself, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki in the Finnish Championships.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the duo ranked second in the tournament is clear.
The realistic goal is a medal.
We're still missing the SM-gold from the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
This weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await in the field of civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament.
The toe slippers are put on the nails, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Salomon Koli boldly started as a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Koli started working together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli as the successor of their home farm two years ago.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come in handy from agriculture.
This has been my thing ever since I was a little boy.
I’ve always enjoyed working on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I’ve put everything on the line.
If you want to start something, I think you need to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yard-tower, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I joined the project with great courage and I have been fully involved in it,” says Salomon Koli and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would turn out well again.
The goal of Salomon Koli, who breeds meat trucks, is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the contest of the young food producer of the Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
He will be able to vote on the magazine’s website until August 21.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation was 1% in July.
This is the highest value in many years (since June 2012) and the first time it has risen above zero since October last year, when the country reported a positive inflation rate of 0.2%.
The average annual inflation rate measured by CPI over the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016: 1% compared to December 2015) has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, an increase was observed in the prices of the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and scheduled maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat Anime Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers find it racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, approximately 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are unpretentious, feature-distorting tools that create over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All false steps quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized for favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin tones as a beauty idea.
So when it offered some of its users a filter this week that made their eyes diagonal, distorted their teeth, and made their cheeks plump, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these recurrent contradictions point to a bigger problem the company has with diversity.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday and was written by online publications such as The Verge and Motherboard on the day after Snapchat said it had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some of them vehemently denied the anime parable.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet about the images was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was “at least offensive and embarrassing.”
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the equating of a very tasteless Asian caricature with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but a demeaningly extreme one."
Snapchat is not the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, there seems to be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, ranging from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s large audience consists of young people who are more diverse by ethnic background than their older counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more delicacy.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, this type of thing is no longer very easily overlooked, as it used to be," 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer on the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to remove his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article published in Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s mostly white and men-only leadership and concluded his essay with the hashtag: <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that their one-sided staff don’t have colored people, so they can make decisions like this, or they have colored people as employees, but their position isn’t such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily,” Zhu said.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the allegation.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, citing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but its spokesman said the company has recently hired a recruiter whose goal is to focus on underrepresented groups of people and promote inclusion within the company.
Zhu, for his part, says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds, “I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this isn’t OK.”
Congressional Expert Group Says Military Officials Distorted Intelligence on ISIS
A group of Congressional experts released a report Thursday that officials in the U.S. military, the Central Command, altered intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what happened on the ground.
The Republican chairs of the House Armed Services Committee, a subcommittee responsible for intelligence and defense budgets, set up a working group to report on the "public discontent" of military intelligence analysts, who said senior military officials were embellishing their assessments of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, in short Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence findings approved by Centcom’s senior executives generally gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism activity than the facts on the ground showed, and were invariably more positive than what other intelligence services had analyzed,” the report said in a press release.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable – our soldiers are suffering when high-level policymakers are presented with false analyses,” California Republican Ken Calvert said in a statement.
“Centcom’s management errors extend to the top level of the organization.”
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems encountered in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command’s descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi troops.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that reports commissioned by the Obama administration have been falsified, it does give analysts the impression that Centcom executives would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than what actually happened," the report said.
"For example, a Centcom official made a public statement that a major military offensive to recapture Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under Islamic State control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," Kansas Republican Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
“From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top-ranked intelligence leaders in the U.S. armed forces manipulated the intelligence obtained to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq.”
Republicans set up a task force after they learned of the analysts’ suspicions that intelligence on ISIS had been manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, will be followed by more detailed results, as the studies continue.
In addition, the Department of Defense’s Chief Inspector has launched an investigation into Centcom’s intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which were in part consistent with the Republican working group’s conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process to evaluate intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democrat on the committee.
According to Schiff, this process “delayed the publication of intelligence results, violated the morale of analysts” and “insufficiently pays attention to divergent views.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats said there was no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust its conclusions to a “predetermined or political official line.”
The Daily Beast reported Tuesday on the preliminary results of a congressional study.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's Chief Inspector, which began as a result of lawsuits filed by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Inspector General's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: “Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a wholesome dialogue on these key national security issues.”
The investigation has other repercussions besides attempting to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (accused by an increasing number of defence authorities).
However, the allegations made last year cast doubt on President Obama's ability to rely on the Central Command and its ability to make honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of intelligence about IS responds to disagreements that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that found that, despite protests by many analysts, the government of President George W. Bush supported only small troops in Iraq and spent little time pondering the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against intelligence on ISIS.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker team came to the conclusion that, despite public statements to the contrary, the air strikes on IS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group, as it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the study were not passed on outside the Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators had judged the testimony given to the Senate to have been too positive about the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of the Central Command.
U.S. wins fourth duel in women’s hockey and establishes position in a confrontation with Britain
After scoring three goals in a 6–1 match against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's national hockey team on Thursday, when the U.S. defeated India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam wasn’t sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I'm not one of those people who keep track of the goals they make."
However, he knows this: The Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and share first place in their group with the British, who continued their winning streak by winning Japan 2–0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States will play each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams made it to the final, which determines which of them will be the first and which will be the second in a group of six teams.
First placer avoids long-term confrontation with the hard-hitting Dutch team that won the second block.
No matter what happens in Saturday’s game, Americans have already stirred up riots about their surprising success in these games, four years after it was the last of the 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took up the field hockey bat for the first time at the age of three (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel).
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to make the final list of players.
After that came the 2012 Games, where he and his team saw little success.
The following year, English coach Craig Parnham was appointed, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental, and physical," says Bam.
“The pace of our work in London was not what it is now.
We've made a complete turnaround."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal score in the first half by hitting the ball close with a knuckle-knuckle in.
India had entered the game without any tournament wins, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1-0 position until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, twisted to the midfield, hit the ball to the finish line, and thus took the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored her final goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first in the tournament to be played by American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who managed to keep the goal empty.
Briggs is now on his way to success.
Same as Bam.
"Our position is good now," Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympics, the trampoline brings zen
Regardless of the time and place, the Olympics will inevitably happen.
Events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to follow as a passionate message, constantly and everywhere.
It’s as if the Olympic fire itself is a flaming stick that moves from archer to swimmer, from swimmer to gymnast and from gymnast to triathlete.
You can’t turn on your TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in a café queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first time Olympic athlete, charms with his smile and could well be the name on everyone’s lips that would be visible and belong to the best time to watch and listen, would be favored by sponsors and would appear in good-will TV ads if he were just a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic light does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Farther from the center, partly in the shadow are less well-known sports such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a modest story about my own special favourite, I'd like to draw attention to the subdued charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so limited that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
Athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never reached the medals or reached the finals until 2012.
In the men’s trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women’s side, the medals are won by Canadians.
Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan will defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
The trampoline, however, has the charm of an underdog. Partly because of its uncivilized ear, it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I admit that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The sport has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoons in the characters’ endless bouncing scenes, but it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming, i.e. the sports that are essential to the trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n, which means "springboard".
Ambitious masters jump on a huge trampoline, which throws them to an altitude of almost 10 meters. Before descending on their feet, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as threads, folds and folds.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged by performance, difficulty level and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the trampoline gymnastics championship, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of Olympic sports is straight ahead.
In pursuit of gold, medalists must go further, faster, up and over the finish line, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal that they pursue in televised reports, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical —and enough to bring the spectator to tears.
But I also find this a bit exhausting just watching the games.
This trampoline offers a respite.
The trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down and slingshots back up effortlessly.
Of course, there is also a competitive aspect to the sport, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve a hectic rush to the finish line or a long jump, only a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to zen as an Olympic competition can get.
Women’s qualifying matches and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and men’s matches on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of their afternoon broadcast, which will start at 2 p.m. local time on both days.
In the midst of Olympiamania bring a peaceful and wonderful moment, which in the midst of the general hustle and bustle might go unnoticed.
And if awareness can only be raised by offering attractive male athletes and objectifying them – as recently suggested by U.S. male gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his sizzling new fan base.
An entire generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have forcibly dispersed protests calling for political change across Ethiopia.
Witnesses say several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government protests that are spreading over ever wider areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
The videos of the demonstrations, supposedly at the end of last year or early this year, show how security forces beat young people with sticks who have been forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The UN chief human rights officer is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"Holding the country together has always been difficult, and moving forward is all the more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group of the Horn of Africa project.
Ethiopia is the second-largest country in Africa after Nigeria, with the West contributing to its stability.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are closely supporting the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, particularly in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive this much help from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, with the capital city of Addis Ababa even having a new urban train.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, is still far from being a model country for democracy: human rights organisations have been constantly reporting on the repressive policies of the government, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are repressed and have no choice but to protest, they will erupt," said Seyoum Teshome, a University Lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
“All the young people are demonstrating.
A whole generation of protesters.”
There are many reasons for dissatisfaction, ranging from the use of land to the government coalition’s stranglehold on power.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat previously held by the opposition, with the result that they now rule the entire parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing on the Eritrean border, where the escalating situation claimed hundreds of lives in the battle in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less defeated in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People’s Liberation Front, may seek to exploit the turmoil and re-arm themselves.
There are many reasons why a bitter mood that has been smearing beneath the surface for years now erupts.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media as cheaper smartphones became commonplace and internet access improved.
Even though the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during protests, many still access the internet through mediation servers that conceal their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this is how they invited people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest population groups in Ethiopia, the Oromo and the Amharic.
The Oromo and the Amharic are not natural allies.
Amharic people, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have long dominated the country's politics and business and exploited the oroms, many of which are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
"The cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Mulatu Gemechu, oromo director.
The biggest protests have been in the Oromo and Amharic regions.
Many Amharic and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by the tigre tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population, but still dominates the army, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
Analysts said he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors to mediate between opponents.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into the shoes of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn’t have the trust of security forces run by the Tiger tribe.
Many fear that this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time such riots took place in Ethiopia was in 2005, when thousands protested against elections that the government, according to analysts, first screwed up and then stole.
In the aftermath of the protests, many protesters were killed, although the death toll was lower than in the previous months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the internal resentment against the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented the intensification.
And resentment is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in Gondar, Amharic city, protesters attacked companies owned by tigers, and hate speech against tigers is on the rise on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft monitoring neighboring Somalia, but the base has recently been closed, the U.S. says.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This requires a strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to retract his words in the latest controversy over his campaign, claiming that he was not serious about claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side about the presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly with the people of his country.
His supporters will also find themselves in an awkward situation, who will have to try to defend their candidate in these turbulent moments and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump made the allegation at an election on Wednesday evening and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
On Friday morning, Trump tweeted that his claim was sarcasm.
Trump tweeted the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down.
The most recent criticism storm rose as Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as the numbers fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to revisit the issue.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes, and said Clinton’s speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself against sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he appeared to be urging Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and retracts his words if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing certain messages that are resonant with his supporters. He looks at how supporters react to messages, and then “clarifies” one way or another, depending on the reactions,” says communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has been observing the language used by both presidential candidates.
“But I also believe he understands his arguments and knows they are sufficiently vague to permeate the various sieves.”
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has in recent days changed his style even more sharply as his backing has continued to decline.
A new poll published Friday by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist revealed that Trump’s support is significantly lower than that of Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is tightly balanced.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after being more and more closely watched in the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have placed his loyal supporters in an embarrassing position to publicly defend Trump’s comments, no matter how provocative.
One of Trump’s most prominent supporters, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, vehemently defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I consider what he said to be a legitimate, political speech,” Giuliani said when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
“That’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama completely mistakenly called a “lower-ranking team,” and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.”
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama administration, in which Hillary Clinton was the secretary of state, allowed ISIS to continue its actions when it failed to deal with the situation resolutely in the Middle East.
In the run-up to Friday’s election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, accusing them of sloppy speeches and discriminatory attitudes toward him.
He mocked the "unworthy and pathetic" television commentators who are trying to find out about him, but he says they can't do it.
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump’s explanation, saying it only shows more clearly that he is not fit to run for president.
Coffee shop closed due to unreasonable rent increase opens in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a sloppy café in Williamsburg, where only cash was used and there was no Wi-Fi, but which served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of its streetside location on Bedford Avenue when the rent went up unreasonably.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals find the loss of this café, which has been dodged by middle classisation, regrettable.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that the CBGB club no longer exists, the Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But even though New York is no longer the same, new things are being created.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just over a kilometre north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unrefined.
Coffee is also good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café.
He started at Verbi in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a client offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, retained many things.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-introduced even the lamps of the old Verb.
Rodriguez says that he also wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
Bacon-egg-cheese-sandwiches and capers and browned onion rings are available.
There is also a list of black currants.
You can no longer get beer from the café, but juices made from fresh fruit instead.
After nine months at the café, Rodriguez says he has noticed that old regular customers have started to visit Verbi as a steady stream.
"Also, many of our old customers were priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited a café on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verbi.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to Verbi, then in Williamsburg.
When Verb closed, he told her that he had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though that Sunday he took a chai tea blend instead of his usual iced coffee, which is also on the list.
Another longtime customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been visiting Verbi faithfully since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and ordered the same thing without exception.
“I walked into the cafe every day after 7:15, like a machine, and there they were already making my voip bagels with all the fillings,” he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to his menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he changes his bagel with bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he has no grudge against the soap shop taking the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap that was made using Verb’s own cold brewed coffee.
"We may still take the offer," Rodriguez says.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says that he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell the coffee shop’s cold-steamed coffee.
The café may also expand into the adjacent building.
However, for many customers it is enough to get their own old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the coffee shop closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home,” says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of coffee."
The Cruel Food of the Great Depression in a New Work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office in the White House.
Known as a culinary artist, President Roosevelt was fond of the luxurious cuisine of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and plum pudding for dessert.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity with the people who are suffering," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds: “It was also a message to Americans how they should eat.”
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights both work as food historians.
Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, tells the story of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman’s latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new co-production is the A Square Meal, published by Harper and published on Tuesday, depicting the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity by agreeing to meet with the journalist at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened in the same year as the big stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a sandwich filled with cream cheese and olives, while Coe, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the meatloaf, the couple said it would be suitable for a discussion about eating during a very large recession.
"The worries were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut crumbs, liver crumbs and bean crumbs.
They were made of materials that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to eat the whole meal.”
Andrew Coe is grinning.
"It must have pressed like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in the countryside, operated on the buffet principle of "eating as much as you want".
Women cooked food for farm workers, and freshly fried pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of how the people survived when abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
“This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans,” says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new low-cost diet: according to Ziegelman, enigmatic dishes such as marshmallows and stews became the main food, and stews were described as "a great way to exploit food leftovers" because chefs could cover up unattractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for years had been the central part of the American meal, became a sparingly used luxury.
We experimented with strange mixtures, where the most important thing was the fulfillment of calorie and nutritional values rather than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While conducting research for a book that also includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared peanut-butter-filled onions as a scarcity-time dish.
"It did not gain popularity at the dinner table," says Coe,
Ziegelman adds: “It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion do not go together at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.”
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who served as the director of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided citizens’ eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be precise budgeters and to meet the challenge of making crispy dishes like carrots and cream-pagates tasty.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are reports of the government's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's 'let me eat cake' attitude.
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on an Iowa farm, he himself ate like the millionaire and sophisticated gentleman he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate in a nearly gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality.”
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his belly.
As reported in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in taste, the food served in the White House was not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst prepared.”
Many of the food of the recession was abandoned as soon as the earth got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and dietary intake, and how science has been applied to cooking.
As the couple writes the book, they say they begin to understand more about Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, including why she couldn’t throw away food.
"He was really afraid of having to throw away food," says Coe.
"People even started getting sick of his food," Ziegelman recalls.
"For example, once on wind hats."
After the main plates were emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe picked up the plum dessert they had made at home, the same one President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman and adds that giving a spectacular name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly immersed our spoons in thick brown lumps.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe sacked a second and a third time.
"German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budgeter.
Gilead Full Reimbursement of Lawyer’s Fees for Hepatitis C Drug Patent Dispute with Merck
A judge in the U.S. District Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to full compensation for attorneys’ fees for a patent dispute with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co. Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of <0x24>200 million in damages for violations of two patents owned by Merck in connection with the Gilead Sovaldi and Harvoni success drugs. A U.S. judge found Merck to have committed violations, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a lawsuit filed on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says Gilead was entitled to exemption from attorneys’ fees for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90 percent of people with hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed the private ownership of sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead’s medicines, which is currently under laboratory work.
U.S.-backed forces have seized the city of Manbij from ISIS
U.S.-backed forces have seized the town of Manjib, near the Turkish border in northern Syria, after the last remaining militants of the Islamic State group left the city, a spokesman for the forces said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now raking into the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a spokesman for the SDF's Manbij Military Council, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by IS fighters have been released.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still conducting search operations," Darwish said.
The Clintons earned <0x24>10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced her 2015 tax return, showing her and her husband’s income at the time was <0x24>10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid was <0x24>34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated <0x24>1 million to charities, most of it to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly <0x24>5.3 million in speech fees, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that she had earned <0x24>3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on her term at the State Department.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife, Anne Holton, announced a 10-year tax return.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show a model for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The exact opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and cancels his promises to publish his tax records.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to always disclose their tax records, even if they are not required to do so by law.
New York-based businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the Tax Administration for an audit, calling it the reason why Trump has not released his income data.
"The transfer is yours," Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the tax information of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special counsel, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax records until the inspections were completed.
Trump critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose the information raises questions about Trump’s equity, his contributions to charity, his business relationships, and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has tackled this issue and posted a video online on Friday in which she highlights prominent Republicans urging Trump to disclose his tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in an economic speech in Michigan.
“Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and does not publicize his tax returns,” Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a key issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a bill named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than <0x24>1 million a year pay at least 30 percent tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose head office is at the same location as Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax records.
Buffett says he has also been subjected to a tax audit and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign continued to publish tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, now residing in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent of real federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, only <0x24>100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported a total of <0x24>109,000 in dividends and interest income.

Chili-powder-filled sparkling condoms to support elephant protection in Tanzania
Wildlife conservationists in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements—the elephants are swept away by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, has launched a campaign with the American Nature Conservancy to teach volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and farms without harming elephants.
Until recently, spears were used to squeeze elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"After developing the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can be confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without damaging them," Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation, said in a statement.
First, the intruding elephant is haunted by pointing to the torch and playing the horn.
If this doesn't work, throw the so-called chilipeper.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is put into a condom together with the flare, after which the end of the condom is twisted so that only the fuse is left outside.
When the fuse is ignited, the condom explodes and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually one spice cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last thing to do is to throw a candle into the air and create a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code from Arab “call” – RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin gave birth to a media rage after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not mention the Israeli area code in its country code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah documentary on the Holocaust, unleashed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
During a recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel from the list of area codes offered by the hotel.
However, it is not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the room.
“How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel will be completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?”
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility to call Israel through a separate call center.
The filmmaker asked the hotel reception for an explanation.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist’s response shocked him.
The receptionist said Israel’s removal from the list was “a carefully considered decision by the management of Kempinski hotels.”
The reason behind the action shocked the film director even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: “Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding that the Israeli area code be removed.”
Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, said the incident was “a great disgrace.”
"The incident shocks and shocks us all.
It is a great shame.
And it is all the more shameful when we consider that we are in Germany and this is precisely the hotel chain.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to come to the right conclusions,” the ambassador said.
The incident caused quite a reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to alleged demands from Arab customers.
"Shame" was said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel quickly denied the charges, called it a mistake, and apologized to Lanzmann.
"A direct order to exclude Israel from the area code list was never issued," a spokesman for the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel said.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstration of Brazilian students
The students clashed with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered together to protest the government’s public education system reforms.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The riots began when law enforcement attempted to break up a group of students, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration, who wanted to show their dismay at the government’s plans.
The governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a austerity measure to close nearly 100 public schools and relocate 300,000 students to new schools.
Some of the demonstrators made graffiti on the walls, temporarily opposing Michel Temer, who served as president.
The protests took place just a few days after the streets were filled with protesters in support of the disfellowshipped President Dilma Rousseff, while the country's Senate voted on an indictment against him.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
Since the lifting of sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in doing business in Iran has increased since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran.
“Russian companies will continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, increasing trade is one of the top priorities in cooperation between countries," says Dzhagaryan.
In the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached <0x24>856 million.
“In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5% to <0x24>697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to <0x24>158 million.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
“Last year, the Russian mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
For the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries to travel to Russia.
And it’s not too bold to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he says.
Scotsman Callum Skinner wins the British cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner claimed fame in the men's team sprint at Rio's Velodrome last night, when the British trio defended the 2012 London Championship.
Skinner, a 23-year-old from Glasgow, played the role of anchor, which he inherited from his countryman Sir Chris Hoy of Scotland. The young man made the legend proud to reach the finish line and capture the victory of a favorite New Zealand team.
Four years ago, Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing only sixth at the World Championships in London in March, despite Hoy having since left his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of the first leader.
The Hindes came at just the right time.
Hoy’s decision to end his career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
The Scotsman Skinner was a man in whom British coaches believed and where they saw the potential that he has now redeemed.
The Hindes, with Hoy winning the championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner set an Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in a duel.
The Hindes were narrowly behind after their round, but Kenny struggled to lead the team, which Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was changing the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down in a larger gear, which allowed Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep up.
Hoy followed the BBC as a commentator and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, says: “I’m flattered by the comparison.
I'm just trying to do my best and be successful.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the World Champions.
It was unbelievable.
There’s no better way to win it.”
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had fallen on purpose due to a poor start.
He later withdrew his words, and British rivals had no means of appeal.
This time there was no such problem with the sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "The feeling was like in London, all the flags of Great Britain were flying in the grandstand.
Our team has been unified over the past three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships that it feels great to win the Olympics.”
In other words, one race, one gold medal for the country, which won seven out of ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress made over the last five months, we will be facing a successful five days on the Velodrome.
As Kenny has shown with his abilities, it’s not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s achievements and winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
This would mean an account accruing with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was also born on March 23 (a magical date for British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medals would then be the same as Hoyt's.
Kenny will compete next in the sprint, which starts today and will be decided in three days.
Kenny, 28, from Bolton, says: “I can only rejoice at this moment.
Team competition is always the best.
You will enjoy the victory together with your friends.
Winning alone is a bit lonely.”
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must be knighted."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were among the fastest four-man team-back racers.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record for winning gold in 2012 was 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (at 22:42) will take place today on the second day of the race, with Wiggins definitely in the spotlight.
Yesterday, he had a fight with the race officials before the timer, when the officials invited him to measure his height.
In a similar women’s competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached a world record of 4:13,260.
The British team can now count on its mighty track cycling team to take over the middle of the Olympics and bring a bunch of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, the expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of the competitive careers of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the Velodrome on the first night show that the already legendary reputation of the UK to rise to the top at the perfect moment is once again realized.
The future of the Portland smelter is at stake due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelter in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when the power company that supplies the smelter with electricity said that one of the plant's owners is in the process of dismantling a supply contract and that it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of a decision by the Victorian government earlier this year not to extend the subsidies to keep the plant in operation.
Fixed, 20-year support will cease in November.
The Alcoan Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As many as 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk as a result of the redundancies.
The snowball effect may continue to increase, as the smelter consumes about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelting plant, which forced the Anglesea power plant to close last year.
Alcoa's Portland smeltery is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
These measures are in line with years of speculation about the future of the plant, first triggered by the strong Australian dollar and, more recently, by the factory's production price.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other owners of the smelter to also terminate their contracts.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, which is owned by CITIC in China and Marubeni Corp in Japan.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain operational, which means that physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
AGL states that the agreements are so-called hedging agreements, which were scheduled to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice period is 12 months, so they will expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue for the fiscal year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential profit effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong market prospects in terms of wholesale electricity market prices.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by <0x24>187 million “in anticipation of the termination of contracts.”
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to maintain the smelter or secure the electricity supply to the smelter".
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, although it still has to find out why it has now withdrawn from the contract.
Due to the industry’s weak financial situation, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both the smelter in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In a speech to analysts earlier this week, AGL chief operating officer Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago uses approximately 900 megawatts per year.
"If these factories leave the market, this will mean a significant drop in demand in the (electricity) market.
As a producer, that would not be good news for us,” says Mikkelsen.
Kardashian reality TV star Kendall as the cover girl of September Vogue
A model from the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s advertising face and performed at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the cover in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a quirky (or maybe just a Kardashian-style?) scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (the bartenders Rob and Caitlyn and everyone’s favorite uncle, producer Ryan Seacrest) who were planning a cover of their forgotten sister.
The plot is clichéd and used in almost every birthday episode of the graduation program (Seacrest says the words, “Did you think we had forgotten you?” as sincerely as the children’s morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to get her other daughters involved in this publicity in some way.
For appearing in the September issue of Vogue unquestionably marks a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made it to Vogue's cover before (she appeared on Vogue's cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
A number more like a big picture book than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site Fashionista calculated that last year’s 832-page opus had 615 pages of ads).
The September issue of the cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the past two years the magazine’s images have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover models for September were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has featured celebrities who work as models rather than models who are celebrities.
The Oscar winner and Dior ad face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as the success model of his generation, and even though he would rather be among the celebrities working on the model, he is still in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars, or modern-day children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all about these).
You can rightly call them talented women who are more successful in the entertainment industry than anyone else.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has had one of the strongest years of her career when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of her reality TV background, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid for calling them "bitches."
These feelings have resurfaced when the news of Jenner’s appearance on Vogue’s cover came out.
However, the constant whining of dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover of Vogue’s September issue.
She's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks in Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
She's the face of Estee Lauder makeup.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford’s daughter, whom he photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he's on reality TV, maybe just a way to meet his sister and her kids.
Legal aid centers expel 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160 000 of the country's most vulnerable people are being expelled from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact that further cuts in funding will have on centres that are already operating at an extreme level.
In Queensland, three out of five people who seek free legal assistance and legal services are already expelled – most of them elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal assistance services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, legal aid centers are at risk of losing another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Center for Public Legal Aid, says that according to the latest calculation report by the National Association of Legal Aid Centers, thousands of people are already being expelled from the centers each year.
If the federal government doesn't make a fuzzy decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public legal aid centers are constantly underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away as they seek the necessary services they need,” says Farrell.
“People leaving violent relationships, people under an uncontrollable and crippling debt burden, divorced families, unduly laid off workers – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of Queensland’s most vulnerable will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to put an immediate end to these cuts so that people can get the legal help they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average level.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clientele, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign has been sued for threatening an employee with a gun
New York: A lawsuit was filed against Donald Trump’s campaign for allegedly not taking any action after its leadership was informed that the campaign’s North Carolina leader had threatened a worker with a gun while driving in a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in a lawsuit filed by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign, in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with within the campaign before he realized, in his own words, that this was not going to happen.
Bordini says in his suit that campaign leader Earl Phillip "raised a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pressed the barrel into Vincent's kneecap."
According to the complaint, after submitting a complaint to the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Even if the weapon is not fired, it will cause damage," says Bordini in his suit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate infuriated the crowd in North Carolina by saying that “supporters of the Second Amendment” – considered gun owners and gun enthusiasts – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to elect the judges.
Trump’s campaign staff said the media took his words out of context and that Trump’s words did not encourage violence.
In his suit, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign for the indifference of the leadership, and from Phillip for the assault, assault, and the mental suffering caused by it.
Trump’s spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to a message asking him to comment.
Phillip was not reached, despite his efforts.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
No immediate response was received to a call from Phillip’s consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been running a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow is also revitalising the economy and creating prosperity – not just in local communities and in London, but across the country.
For myself, this was the thing that interests me the most in Heathrow, and as in the 2012 London Olympic Games, we put a huge amount of effort into ensuring that they benefit our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympic Games brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
Like at the 2012 London Olympics, there will always be people who think the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympic Games are concerned, I have heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will find ourselves in an embarrassing situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and boost the economy by GBP 211 billion, bringing skills and employment to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and within the budget, including the T5 terminal – voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, built in the middle of two of the world’s busiest runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, backed by a private investment of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The 2012 Olympic Games in London were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for the expansion of Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of Heathrow's board of directors and former commercial secretary to the Treasury Department.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Adblocker in Cat-Mouse Play
The attempts of companies making money from online advertising to mislead ad-blocking software have turned into a cat-mouse game, says one company that produces blocking programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking ad blockers, Adblock Plus posted a blog post in which it said users could update their blocking software filters and thus again block social media ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change its desktop site’s ad tagging codes to make it harder for ad blockers to identify which parts of the page are ads.
However, Adblock now says it has cleared the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of buzz has been going on between the open-source ad blocker community and the scammers since the ad blocker was invented” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair move again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has participated in the battle is a strong indication of how much concern advertising blockers have become in the industry.
An estimated 200 million people worldwide are using ad blockers, according to a survey conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, a figure that has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices every day, and mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company intends to invest in deceiving ad blockers in its desktop application, as the spokesperson said mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it is updating its user preferences ad tool to give users more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, saying they would also prevent some of the usual Facebook posts from appearing.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
“Ad-blocking programs are clumsy and ineffective, and that’s why we’ve invested in developing user preferences like ad tools so people can control ad targeting.”
Woman commits suicide by driving under a Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking for witnesses on the highway in the first hours of Thursday for help in an accident in which a woman intentionally crashed into several cars.
The accident took place on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud, near Morges, shortly after midnight.
The woman did a desperate thing by lying down on a dark road and was hit by several cars, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, was clearly committed suicide, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified. The police ask them or other witnesses to report the accident.
Gilles Hofstetter, a lawyer, reports in the Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
It remains to be seen, however, whether charges will be brought against the drivers involved in the accident.
"Was it impossible to avoid the collision?
It is up to the prosecutor," Hofstetter said.
In the last five years, there have been two similar incidents in which motorists are not held responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, the person walked in the dark on the highway and the court ruled that motorists cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of being charged with death for colliding with a man on an A1 highway near Paynerne on an August night in 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed a lot of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court ruled that the way the police – who were responding to the emergency call – were driving was justified, and the man lying on the road was a “absolutely exceptional and unforeseen situation.”
Anyone who knows of an accident near Morges on Thursday will be asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus Has Been Viable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study the past of Venus using the same tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The purpose of the model was to determine whether the conditions on Venus could have been similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless on its surface and its atmosphere is almost entirely made up of carbon dioxide.
According to earlier statements by scientists, the slow rotational speed of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the most recent simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and yet it has rotated slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early surface formation of Venus.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent fainter.
"In GISS modelling, Venus rotates slowly and has a half-day per sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and creates rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are up to a few degrees lower than the Earth’s current temperatures.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to the planetary scientists' earlier assumptions about its evolutionary course.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
With hydrogen karate into space, all that remained was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect —that is, Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of a new Venus climate modelling in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche’s coach and deputy general manager of the club’s ice hockey operations, citing a lack of influence in the team’s decision-making.
Colorado’s vice president and chief executive, Joe Sakic, confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have served as the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the club’s vice president of hockey with energy, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
“During the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I can improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the coach and the club’s deputy general manager of hockey operations must be in complete alignment with the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment.”
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the Year for his first season as head coach of Avalanche in 2013–14.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not made it to the next season in the last two years.
Avalanche scored 39-39-4 points in the 2015–2016 season and was five points away from the Minnesota Wild while playing for another Wild Card position at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two for the Montreal Canadiens and two for Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers to start talks and halt strike
The main negotiators say the wage strikes for oil workers in the North Sea will be interrupted as all parties to the dispute participate in the new round of negotiations.
There have been strikes against Wood Group, an oilfield service company, on drilling rigs in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the joint statement of the parties, “Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute.”
As of the beginning of next week, we will have several full-day meetings over the coming weeks, where we will discuss problems from fresh perspectives.
Trade unions justified their recent actions, which they said were the first in more than 25 years, in protest of possible pay cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut tariffs for its North Sea contractors by about 9% this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is consistent with a 10% reduction in land-based contractors' prices in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts will give it the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, aiming to streamline its operations following its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June put pressure on energy companies.
Earlier this week, Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders to discuss one of the biggest clashes that have occurred in the North Sea for a generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
“In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that benefits many, not just a few,” Anderson said.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to spend less than <0x24>1.4 billion in 2016, compared to around <0x24>7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiadian cluster
The most recent mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the speed of stellar rotation, which has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive list of the speeds of stars in the Pleiadian star cluster to date.
Based on new data, astronomers will be able to find out why stars in the same star cluster rotate at different speeds and how rotational times are related to the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star weight and age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the University of Caltech in Pasadena.
The Pleiadian star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the star cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are about to reach adulthood.
They are now spinning faster than ever.
When the rotation speed is at its peak, large amounts of star wind erupt from the stars that are growing up.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they travel through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognisable star spots (corresponding to sunspots).
The latest recorded rotational speed data suggests that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – bigger ones spin slower than smaller ones.
“We see from the Pleiadian ‘dance’ that slow-moving ones are typically larger, while the fastest-moving ones are typically very light stars,” says Rebull.
Because the Pleiadian star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of stars in relation to their rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian star cluster provides a pillar for theoretical models of rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational speeds and end their "dance."
Rebull and colleagues present their latest analysis of the Pleiadian rotational speeds in three new articles to be published shortly in the Astronomical Journal.
