I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Is your daughter feeling better?

It's not over until we're over it.
I'll take his place.
I take the train to work every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
You're better off with your sister.
That goes with the love I have for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.
Could be a problem.
Must be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all that work wasted.
I'm clearly upset.
It's not broken.
I didn't feel bad.
That didn't help much.
The snow did not stop.
The snow did not stop.
It's cold to see if you're coming.
It won't do anything!
It doesn’t matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it's been poured on me.
I slowly realized that I misunderstood him.
It was snowing the day before.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of last week.
That was on the day of our marriage, darling.
There must have been a reason for this.
It happened suddenly.
That was when he was out.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
It has its own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think every fat person should be on a diet.

I think I've got the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It was like seeing a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's fair.
It is very unlikely, in my opinion, that you will be able to do it yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think that's unfair.
That's what I think.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think you'd better leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor may have died.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone at the door.
I think something's wrong.
I find spiders cute.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about that.
I think that would explain everything.
I think, so I drink.
I think, so I exist.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think you've done a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
I think this medicine will be good for you.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom's been there before.

I think we can handle it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we're going the wrong way somewhere.

I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what Tom's girlfriend's name is.
I think you're gonna approve.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.

I think you should go in person.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your work is very good.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you weren't convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I meant Tom.
I thought going out to eat would cheer you up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was obvious what I wanted.
I thought my head was going to explode.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the mat, but it didn't turn out to be.
I thought Tom was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought it was you.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
It hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under his influence.
It really impressed me.
It's an accident.
It's a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what we're talking about.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.
I doubt it will work.
It's getting really late.
He's gone.
It's half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It’s time to start a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
Basically, it's your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
It's amazing.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to be prepared for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It is not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke detector cannot be switched off.
That's not the best way.
It's not the right thing to do.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not right to speak with a full mouth.
It's snowing.
It's still moving.
Wow, it's really bad today.
It's so expensive.
Thirty meters long.
Time to go to bed.
This is an easy task for him.
It's up to you.
This is useful information.
It's hot at night.
It is very important to wash your hands thoroughly after changing your baby’s diaper.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
He'll be ready when he needs it.
It'll be ready when it's needed.
It will take some time to get used to wearing glasses.
It's going to wear off soon.
It'll work if I reverse the polarities.
Consequently, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like you don't need me here.
You could use a shave.
Looks like you're not feeling very well here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what counts.
That could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it.
I might be late.
It needs to be washed.
It has to mean something.
It must have been love.
It must have been stolen.
It needs to be repaired.
He never existed.
It never should have happened.
I lied to him even though I didn't want to.
I told him I would do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tom not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you wouldn't listen.
I told you, I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tom.
I have a question for you, too.
I took a long bath.
I was in the tub for a long time.
I'm set.
I took the 58th.
I was sure you were on our side.
Yesterday I took my cat to the animal hospital.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It would probably be cheaper elsewhere.
It rained yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I train for two hours a day.
I traveled all over Russia.
I traveled across the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried everything to keep her alive.
I tried to forget.
I was trying to help Tom.
I'd trust him with my life.
I try to keep myself informed.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
A big-haired cat.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
It's a gray stone building.
It's a watchdog.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's completely dark outside.
It's all mine.
It's over.
That's nice and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's 7:00 already.
It's already underway.
It's ten o'clock already.
One of my dreams has always been to live by a stream.
It's always the same song.
Environmental catastrophe.
It's an ugly business, Watson, it's an ugly, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
That's too bad.
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tom is leaving.
That's a pretty big stick.
It's a rumor.
It's freezing.
This is just as much an art as it is a science.
It's a thing of the past.
He's in school.
It is a very dangerous sport, where even a small mistake can lead to serious injury.
This is a very old book.
It's a waste.
Strange question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It's been a long day.
It was an amazing journey.
It's a very tiring day.
It's a tough day.
This has happened before.

Oh, God.
Cheaper to take the bus.

Closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold in here.
It's cold, I got goose bumps.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you wear a sweater?
It is well known that bears love honey.
It doesn’t matter if Tom did it or not.
That's perfectly normal.
It's all right.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
That's really good.
It's done!
It's easier not to start than to stop.
It’s easy to be brave from a distance.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't love Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
The bus seemed to be late.
That sounds completely ridiculous.
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Nothing seems to have changed.
It looks very strange.
I guess so.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's in no hurry.
Like you don't want this to happen to me.
Looks to me like you're being honest.
Seems to me you're wrong.
Looks like we're going to have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Expensive.
It’s fair to get the same pay for the same job.
It's not even perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, it's funny.
He's falling over.
He's getting serious.
We're gonna have a rough winter.
It's not gonna be easy.
It's lucky to see a shooting star.
It's good to be gay.
Good for learning.
I'm so glad you could make it.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard not to come to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe that the weather has been clear and sunny all this time.
Difficult to describe.
It's hard to find a bench to sleep on in this town.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
Spookyly beautiful.
His head is disproportionately large.
Tall.
Children should be in bed.
Stop spreading the money.
It's warmer than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
It's important.
It is important for parents to be on the same side when it comes to raising children.
It is important to help those in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to suffocate in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to live up to your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your conditions.
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.
It's unbelievable, you know?
It's inevitable.
That's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just a few steps away.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's kind of heavy.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's late.
It's laundry day.
It's like an underwater field, and turtles, rays, and sharks are above it, like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic the way he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
That's a good idea.
This is not a bank.
It's not as crazy as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not good enough.
That's not gonna happen.
It is not your job to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negotiable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This is not the 19th century.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
What matters is not what you do, but how you do it.
There's no reason to be sad about it.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
There is no point in confessing to the priest unless you repent.
There's no point in grieving about the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
Definitely impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think you're peasants.
It's okay to be gay.
“Three months have passed, and Tom says he speaks French fluently. “Yeah, he’s at the top of his stupid arm.” “What peak?” “Dunning-Kruger effect.”
It's only three days.
He's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's pouring out like it's pouring out a jug.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
Pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these misanthropic theories is to discredit the working class, to exonerate imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars it has instigated, and to sow the seeds of the idea that the innate aggression of man is the cause of endless wars.
It's very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
That's a really big deal.
There he is.
It's rude to ask someone how much they make.
They say Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit! Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston.
It's so good to stay home.
It's still moving.
It's suicide.
This is technically possible.
This is the best book I have ever read.
It's the least I can do.
Theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
That has to be answered.
It's time to pick up our tent trees.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time! Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should get my hair cut.
Time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It is high time we did something about this.
It's Tom's birthday.
It's Tom's decision.
Tom's word is against Mary's.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's expensive to me.
It's too hot for that now.
Late grief.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical autumn weather.
It sucks to have a cold.
It's ugly, it's bright yellow and it doesn't harmonize with anything, but at least they don't run over in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think he is.
It is unlikely that anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we go there or not.
She's very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
It's very entertaining.
It's expensive to live here.
That's very kind of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed.
It's your only option.
It takes about 10,000 hours to learn a language.
You have to be bold to succeed.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It took me nearly three years to build my house.
Everyone was surprised.
It took an hour.
It took me a long time to write this book.
It took me more than a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to choose a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but in the end I managed to find it.
I turned into a small alley.
I flipped.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was fun.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was a really good meal.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was terribly strange.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was chaotic.
It was definitely very enjoyable.
We had fun last night.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot and the weather was humid.
It was just a trip.
It was just too easy.
That's what I said.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost pitch dark.
This was not long before John had an idea; he always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
This was not a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy keeping my promise.
That was a hit under the belt.
It didn't matter.
I wasn't the one who slammed the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't intentional.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't that bad.
This isn't the first time they've done this.
It wasn't Tom.
It was a joke.
I only found out his true intentions when I met him.
It didn't hurt.
It rained last night.
It was kind of weird.
That was really interesting.
It was really fast.
It was really sad.
It was a success.
That was great.
That's all I could think of.
It was the worst pain I've ever had.
Tom was next.
They kept it completely secret.
He was unsure whether he would marry her.
It was urgent.
In a few days, it'll all be over.
It'll be over in a few days.
In a few days, it'll all be over.
It will take five or ten years for the technology to be ready.
This will grow back.
That's what's gonna happen.
It's going to rain for a week if it doesn't stop tomorrow.
This will threaten the well-being of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
There's no need to do that anymore.
It doesn't take much time.
It worked beautifully.
Works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
It would be hard for me to leave.
It wouldn't make sense.
It would have been better if it had already been arranged.
That's not courage. That's stupid.
It would have been better if we hadn't.
I underestimated Tom.
