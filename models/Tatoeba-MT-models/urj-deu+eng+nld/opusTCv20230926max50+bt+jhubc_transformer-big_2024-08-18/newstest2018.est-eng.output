Four members of the Kemerovo Group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, the head of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, Slava Gulevich, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky, was detained by the police in Spain.
Gulevich, who was arrested in Spain, was arrested with the permission of a court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
It is suspected that these are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal group, aged 27-57, who commit mainly drug crimes.
In Mijas, Malaga, Spain, an alleged leader of a criminal organisation was arrested.
In Estonia, three men were arrested as suspects, one of whom, according to the collected data, is the leader of a criminal organisation and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected suggest that there was a clear division of responsibilities and roles within the criminal community.
The purpose of the activities of the criminal association was to commit narcotics offences and thereby earn criminal proceeds," said the head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, Attorney General Vahur Verte.
"We will not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement agencies in the past, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte emphasised that cooperation with his Spanish counterparts had been an important aspect throughout the investigation.
“International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week’s operation shows the success of the cooperation,” said Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said the arrests had been preceded by a criminal investigation lasting almost a year and a half.
"During the first half of the week, long-term work was realised and we simultaneously arrested suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that officials of the Central Criminal Police were helping with detention in Spain.
For years, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are another message to criminals that we can catch them from the other side of Europe," said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that, while in prison, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting to be handed over to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized in order to secure confiscation.
Pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the Bureau of Organised Crimes of the Central Criminal Police and headed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of blackmail and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world, after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, came to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s, when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at different hotels and charged a monthly roof tax on businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal proceeds and court decisions in force confirm the effectiveness of the fight against organised crime.
For example, the latest judgments, the eight defendants separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikayev Criminal Association, from whom a criminal proceeds of EUR 80 000 was confiscated, or the judgment against nine persons for the fact that in 2006 Igor Aleynikov set up a criminal association aimed at the illicit trade in secret cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in Eastern Viru and Southern Estonia.
The amount of confiscated criminal proceeds is approximately 71,500 euros.
The success of these criminal cases has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and prosecutors exchange evidence and, if necessary, carry out joint operations in any country of the European Union.
Citizens' rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group’s statement reads: “The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, valid until August 28, 2017, invites all African-American travelers, visitors, and Missorians to be particularly attentive and extremely careful when traveling throughout the state, given the suspicious race-based events that have recently taken place here and across the state.”
According to the NAACP, the group was urged to issue a travel alert by the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, as well as the fact that the state's law enforcement agencies are unequally targeting minorities.
“People’s rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the edge of the road because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had such intense complaints before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization on the state of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances at the beginning of this year after he ran out of gas while driving through the state and was arrested by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Attorney General of Missouri, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be stopped than white drivers.
"The note is meant to make people aware and alert their families, friends and co-workers to what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared, whether it’s taking bail money or informing relatives that they’re going through the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s Hate Crimes Reporting Program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state 16th in terms of the number of similar violations across the country.
The travel alert is also a response to Missouri’s new law that makes it harder for a company to sue for discrimination in its search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that forced local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to the ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
Travel alerts are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but more recently, interest groups have begun using this measure as a response to certain domestic laws and trends in the United States.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about the different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, with a malignant course, chronic hepatitis B and C can develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver crease and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, Epidemiology Adviser to the Health Board, says that the signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last symptom of the disease also comes from the popular name of liver inflammation jaundice.
In children, hepatitis can pass without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation of the liver can be determined only on the basis of data from a laboratory study.
Acute hepatitis can turn into chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without any signs of the disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Hearing Kutsar highlights different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, having sex, stooling an infected person’s hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, getting into the mouth, and consuming drugs.
The risk group for hepatitis A infection includes family members and caregivers of the affected person, people with chronic liver diseases, people having sex with the infected person, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Vaccination can be prevented by vaccination, in particular, vaccination is recommended for people who travel extensively and are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before eating.
Hepatitis B viruses are transmitted by exposure to the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattoos, piercing, use of blood-contaminated household items (toothbrushes, shaving tools), donation of blood, sex with a person suspected of hepatitis B, and from a mother with hepatitis B to a foetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sexual partners of the infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, family members and carers who are ill, healthcare, rescue workers and police officers who are in contact with blood and other body fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as people with chronic liver disease, HIV-infected, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures against hepatitis B include: abstaining from the use, tattooing and piercing of foreign means of hygiene and manicure, other sharps and needles, and the use of condoms in case of contagious sex or the prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation programme in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of a sick person, by injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household media, by donating blood, by having sex with a person suspected of hepatitis C, and by a mother/newborn with hepatitis C.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sexual partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, contact with blood and other body fluids by health care, rescue workers and police officers, persons infected with HIV, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C.
The preventive measure for hepatitis C is: abstaining from the use of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other sharp tools and needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms in case of contagious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are transmitted by contact with blood and other body fluids, by needles and syringes contaminated with them, sexually, and rarely by the infected mother to the fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with a hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are transmitted via faecal-oral transmission via drinking water and food, including eating little heat-treated beef, fish and shellfish, donor blood, shared syringes and from the infected mother to the fetus.
Travellers can be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high levels of disease.
Preventive measures against hepatitis E are the fulfillment of hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick person.
Wash fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and avoid using drugs.
Although in the last lap the competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic champion off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in 26.49.51.
Farah didn’t think long, dragging her husband Tania and children along after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being with them on the trail was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for the fifth consecutive 5,000 and 10,000 metre gold medal in London.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Dame in Gold: The Extraordinary Story of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, a Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer" delves far deeper into the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But even more profoundly in history.
Perhaps a louder axe would have been used for the awe-inspiring amount of information, and a narrower theme would have allowed the exceptional story of the portrait promised in the title to get more impact.
At present, there are two books between them: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in his painting "Dame in Gold", and a much larger and more comprehensive history book on respected Jewish families and the German occupation, with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes you through the bustling cultural life of Vienna, and anyone who has come to the Austrian capital can easily imagine how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago or how everyone turned their heads when Klimt entered the Central Café.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see the familiar name in the book, you feel more culturally than in a grammar.
However, the fact that Sigmund Freud was operating in a city with incurable syphilis and the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to add nothing to the development of the story.
Or perhaps still - every brush stroke in a few sentences adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten inhabitants of Vienna was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch twice and posed for Klimt for his famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh-largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele was not drawn to all the glamorous life she belonged to.
When you look at "The Lady in Gold," it's hard to believe that towards the end of life this majestic lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, he was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt’s order at the time cost 4000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a country house in a good location.
The fact that in some portraits the master’s affair with the model was suspected did not deter the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only definite fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist, which emerged from the work, continued for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Dame darling.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt’s masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer”, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before his work with Adele began, Klimt had visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and researchers believe that the brilliant mosaics seen there from Empress Theodora gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Dame in Gold" in Vienna in 1908 and around the same time (from 1907 to 1908) another golden painting "Kiss" was born.
Art historians did not miss the similarity of the two women.
What does this have to do with Hitler?
“To commemorate my friend Klimt, I think I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public,” Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist’s departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family’s Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of Adele.
In her will (Adele left in February 1925), she also asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four landscape paintings by Gustav Klimt at the Austrian Gallery.
He gave his jewellery to his nieces, Maria and Luise.
A year after Klimt had graduated from the Austrian Mona Lisa, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to enter the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, but failed to draw.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to the fact that he was not accepted into the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, by 1939 the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in Maria's will had changed noticeably - it had become important to find works that were pleasing to the Nazi party in Vienna's rich collections of Jewish art.
Hitler’s personal art treasures also included some of Adele’s homework, but not Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year litigation began between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauers.
If you see the "Kiss" at Belvedere Palace in Vienna, you have to go to the Neue Galerie in New York to see Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Dame in Gold".
And before the trip to Vienna, read the above-mentioned book.
Even if you don’t plan on going to see Klimt’s work, because at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish themes after the book was closed than the <0x24>135 million painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a family fate story - and a very moving story.
The Bauer family tree, mentioned at the beginning of the book, markedly facilitated the orientation of events.
17-year-old swimmer was very close to Estonian record in Canada
In pre-swimming, Gold was close to his own personal record of 200m backstroke, swimming at 2.16.62.
The top mark comes from a week ago, when the 17-year-old girl won the Canadian Junior Championships at 2.16.58, according to Priit Aavik’s swimming blog.
Gold was the last to reach the A-final.
In the final, he finished in a distance of 2.15.76 and reached a good seventh place with a new powerful top mark.
Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2.15,13) left Gold a little over half a second apart.
Gold was ranked third in Estonia’s all-time ranking and his fresh personal top mark is Estonia’s fifth all-time result.
A young hope for the future is still starting at the Canadian Adult Championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and 200 m and 400 m complex swimming.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold made a successful start there as well.
He won the 200 m freestyle silver medal with a time of 2.03.22.
This was the last time this distance was swamped by an Estonian in 2008.
Only Estonian record-breaking Elina Part<0xC3><0xB5>ka has swam this distance faster than Gold in Estonia.
The Estonian woman living in Canada also won a bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season top mark of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, one year older than him, has swam this distance only one hundredth faster.
He reached his personal top mark in the 100 m backstroke, receiving a message at the time of 1.03.69 in the opening exchange of the message swimming.
In the longest distance, he only reached seventh place when he swam in the final of 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season in four different distances.
President Trump on vacation, critics sharpen their teeth
It’s time for the holidays, which means relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
But since Trump has been one of the most vacationing presidents so far, critics are sharpening their teeth.
According to CNN and USA Today, the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation at a golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president’s holiday started yesterday, Trump’s opponents have already spoken about the holiday for a week.
They accuse Trump of having too many holidays.
It is the president’s custom to spend weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days.
For example, George W. Bush was on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama was on vacation for only 21 days less than Trump.
But things are quickly forgotten by Trump.
The days after he became president, Trump said in a 60-minute broadcast that there would be no time for long holidays during his senior year because there was so much to do.
Three years ago, he also expressed displeasure at Barack Obama’s vacation.
The current president tweeted: “While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is cutting off journalists’ heads.”
White House officials say a 17-day visit to a golf club isn’t exactly relaxing.
It’s officially called a work holiday, during which Trump doesn’t have time to read or engage in other activities.
There had to be another reason for the holidays.
Namely, the air conditioning system in the West Wing of the White House is being replaced, which is why all the staff had to leave.
The Oval Office and other offices of the President are also located in the western wing.
“I don’t think any of you would want to be on the west wing in August if it’s 38 degrees and there’s no air conditioning,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
Where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you can see in the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook Don’t Candidate for State Office if You Can’t Cope With Voters’ Criticism
The father of our country knew a lot about the unfavorable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to start babbling him out for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech may be taken away from us, and in silence and silence we may be led to slaughter like sheep."
It brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s officials have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who posted their opinions on his official Facebook page.
At the beginning of the week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The governor’s officials stamped the lawsuit null and void, and the online comments were swamped with counter-reactions in the style of “Who cares?”
“It’s just Facebook,” many said.
But it does matter.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His acceptance rate is the second best among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not an unthinking, reactive buzzhead.
He has ruled the state with a firm hand, and he has strictly adhered to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main means of communicating with his constituents quite skillfully, for example, showing off his bald head lazily for the first time after chemotherapy.
Thus, the governor's page, which is an official public forum managed by taxpayer-dollar-paid staff, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block visitors.
Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, spammers, or a hateful crowd.
The Post had a conversation with several real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's what they are, real people who communicate with their chosen leaders, teachers, business owners and pastors, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and by no means obscene.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan’s Catholicism.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Raman from Bowie, Maryland, did not incite anger, but rather hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in the commentary section of The Post.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, someone immediately indifferently calls it a collective effort, rather than admitting that it’s a lot of concerned citizens.”
What the governor’s official called a “directed spam attack” would probably be called “public support.”
The Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, when workers had to be sent out to do the same, to collect newspapers with critical editorials and burn them, or to arrest protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that’s exactly what’s happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for dismissing Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first significant judgments on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment to the Constitution by blocking a voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) after using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous writers eroded his way of managing.
And even then, Washington had to face anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, shattering Washington’s decisions.
According to historical documents collected as part of George Washington's online letter-collection project, his office was buried under petitions criticizing his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of speech, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
Proper leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty Relies on Homecoming Comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European premiere Ronan Rafferty is counting on the comfort of his home territory for the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the golf courses of the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irishman, who led the last lap of the Archerfield Links circuits in the neighborhood last year before falling for Paul Eales, is fond of the new venue and will replace the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad as the tournament’s envoy.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we can see the club shine in all its glory at this event," Rafferty said.
“The players see the trail in its best form, it’s in a brilliant state.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He is an avid supporter of the golf game and is proud of what has been achieved here.
This makes it possible to present the trail perfectly.”
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending the title for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling," said a player in Southport.
“I couldn’t defend my title at the Extremadura Open because it was taken off the calendar a year after my win.
It's magic to come back to that place.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always have in our hearts.”
Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour at the beginning of the year when he turned 50, will return to the competition again.
This is his first event in Scotland since he took part in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"Playing at home is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburgh's man Orr.
"You want to perform well, but at the same time you feel the extra tension.
I have enjoyed playing golf again and have shown quite a decent game of golf.
I am happy with the progress so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Norr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scotsmen in the race, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free of charge and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 for a car with one passenger and <0xC2><0xA3>10 for a car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
He rarely even uses the pot.
In a wooden cabin in Enarotal, the capital of the reluctant Papuan Regency, Indonesia, a housewife places a sweet potato called nota, in the local language, directly on the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken from the fire and poured into the skin eagerly with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor without furniture and does his daily chores, such as washing his laundry with cloudy water from the nearby sex.
The role of the toilet is played by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Since she is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she is not assigned to care for any of the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work can be dangerous, however, most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to visit after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse of life in the Papuan Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum that forced only 1,026 elderly people to vote in front of the occupying forces.
The movement, which has prompted the liberation of the Dutch from their domination, quickly directed its rage against the government of Jakarta, which is still holding the region under its strong control, with foreign journalists and human rights monitors away.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and Western Papua, leaving the eastern part of the island to independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is both a remote and abandoned place. To get here, you need to fly from the provincial capital Jayapura for 90 minutes to Nabir and then take a five-hour drive with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
With a population of about 19,000, the city is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by corrugated iron roofs, the rust of which has turned various shades of yellowish brown.
Very few Indonesians have travelled here, let alone journalists, and there have been hardly any foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuans of Mee Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing such clothes,” says Degei, referring to his colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse, and bright skirt.
"Before that, we wore only plant leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line and one of Asia’s worst statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy.
It is also a rich country in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153,000 inhabitants in New Jersey, Grasberg is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, a Phoenix-based company.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about <0x24>3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be boasted of a stockpile of commodities wood, estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for the Papuan people, as they require the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times found that Freeport paid local military personnel and military units about <0x24>20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to <0x24>150,000 for one officer.
Papuan aspirations for greater autonomy threaten this golden geese and are mercilessly dealt with.
Human rights activists say more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in Papuan highlands in the 1970s amounted to genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by Indonesian police in the area.
The 2016 Birsbane Archdiocese’s “We Lose Everything” report contains testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electric shocks are particularly common) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because of these incidents happening every week," said Andreas Harsono, a researcher at Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
The screws are even tighter because Papuan natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the large Indonesian islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan family canteens sell gado-gado with crispy chicken and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
“Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables on a traditional market cheaper than local beans,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old born in Pania, who moved to Jayapura, the province’s capital, for work.
"Indigenous Papuan Mama-Mama's [women] will therefore lose their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known to the public as Jokowi, pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter defeated 27 of the 29 constituencies of Papua, including Pania, on his way to the Jakarta presidential palace.
But very little has changed in Papua and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes for the restoration of justice," You said.
In fact, only two months after Jokow took office in October, Paniai struggled in a low state.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotal sang Christmas songs by the fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from darkness.
The shocked children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said drunk soldiers chased children and beat them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so brutally beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young men, women and children from Papua gathered for justice on the football field in front of the local police station and military command centre.
They wore ceremonial hunting vibes and performed the Papuan honey pago tribe’s waita dance, during which they ran around and imitated bird songs.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police and the military.
"If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," according to an official document seen in TIME magazine, but not issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame (56), elder of the district of Kego Koto in Enarotal, sensed the threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine in his bright colors on the veranda of the tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the troops.
"There were many people, there were many shots," he adds.
A local man named Alfius Youw was shot three times, according to a cousin who saw him shot.
"I ran to him and searched his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told Time magazine.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papuan Police Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only guaranteed the safety of his station as it was attacked.
“We need to protect ourselves if we are threatened with death,” Papuan police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
News of the killings came to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses in Papua.
"I want to solve this case now so it never happens again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the crimes against human rights committed.
Almost immediately came the apologies.
“Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
Speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying he had no intention of setting up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be settled by the law.”
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody 1999 independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including those in Pania.
The families of Paniai’s victims accepted such claims with gloomy mistrust.
"I've been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid they'll shoot me."
His brother, Yacobus, confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai were afraid to frame the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me," he said.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot down villagers in the neighbouring Paniai Regiment in Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, as a result of a quarrel between villagers and the head of the construction company, who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24, Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby river while fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s office at the construction site.
Police said the villagers threw stones at police officers, and the latter responded with warning shots.
But locals say a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a panic, afraid of revenge," said Dominggu Badi, 29, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured being recorded.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and for the withdrawal of the police mobile brigade from the area.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development fuels the discontent of the honey, moni, dani, and damal tribes living in Papua’s mediocre highlands.
Many of them have joined the rebel army of the Free Papuan Movement (VPL), which claims to defend Papuan rights by carrying out incidental attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "protecting the sovereignty of the state", the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in Paniai in recent years.
Some of them will never show up again.
Among Papuan people, Panias is known as a "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty fuels dissatisfaction.
The small amount of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for the locals to buy.
Bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow all their food on their own mainly sweet potatoes, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have deepened between indigenous Papuan people and new migrants, many of whom have arrived since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist will go to better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papuans themselves often lack the capital or skills necessary to run a competitive business.
"Young people aren't interested in staying here because there's no jobs or money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Panai Tribal Council.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, there are strict restrictions on external media.
By the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Bastille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not follow relevant practices," although they had been given a rare filming license.
Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch’s Asia department, said Jokow’s election pledges to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development had not been implemented.
"Journalists attempting to report on the most turbulent eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua in Indonesia face new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a persuasive look on the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations, Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of crimes" in Papua, including the Panai shooting.
These countries have also historically supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group’s allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta: “There is still democratic order and freedom of the press in Indonesia, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of cases of human rights violations.”
The local people want more foreign governments to be noticed.
When the Dutch official delegation headed by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people interrupted their silence, according to a source who was present at the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, urging: "We want freedom."
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuan people do not believe they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," said Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to be told that, in addition to the constant threat of a predatory army, the people of Pania are suffering from misery because of poor educational and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like other Papuan people, regard the vote given to Jokow as a debt he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of Paniaia's shooting victims managed to make one last symbolic revolt by burying the body of one of the victims on the ground opposite the police station and military base.
Knowing that justice may never be established, they will at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
The Dubai Torch skyscraper has been devoured by fire for the second time.
The fire hit one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of people to flee the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
This is the second fire that has ravaged a high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no damage was reported and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
“We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and the screaming of people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get off the 50th floor,” a resident told Reuters, calling himself George.
According to Dubai civil defence officials, firefighters extinguished the flame around 4 a.m. local time (00 a.m. GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident could once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
In an investigation conducted by the board of Torch after a fire in 2015, it was found that the most damage was caused by facades - decorative panels and insulation of the exterior.
British police have said they believe that the insulation and facade panels of the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, which killed about 80 people.
See: These phones are likely to become bestsellers in the fall
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone manufacturers will unveil their new top models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were released in the spring, and new hit phones are also expected to be released in the autumn.
According to Tele2’s Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Seema, this year’s flagships are characterised by an innovative design, an iris scanner, a 4K display with edge-to-edge resolution and an ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales ranking.
Autumn promises even faster fast charging, a more durable battery, a better quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that rumors can already be used to make assumptions and predict the four top models that are likely to conquer this year’s sales rankings.
These four top smartphone models will be on the market in the fall of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to be on sale in mid-September.
Rumors about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading a lot.
While the iPhone 7 didn’t bring any significant differences with the iPhone 6s, Apple’s 10th birthday is expected to set the new model apart completely from the previous ones.
There are four colours: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen that covers the entire front of the phone, the home button is lost and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
JonyIve, Apple’s head of design, wants the new iPhone to look like smooth glass.
There is also talk about the iPhone version.
In addition to an iris scanner, wireless charging and an even higher-quality camera, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
This is one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
The Galaxy Note 8 will be pre-ordered on August 23.
There are a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is said that the S Pen is designed for even more business users and allows for even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a wide angle and the other a telephoto lens with a narrower field of view.
At the moment, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung’s first test, which is definitely comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
We look forward to August 23.
While Nokia has launched three smartphones this year with the Nokia 6, there is still a lack of their flagship, the Nokia 8, which will be unveiled on August 16.
We expect Nokia to have a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge screen and a high-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminum housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Similar to Samsung, the new Nokia model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are manufactured by the company Zeiss.
While Sony’s flagship has so far been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We’re looking for a smartphone that’s a bit more modest than XZ Premium, but with at least as good or better cameras.
It has been speculated that Sony’s new model will have a screen of at least six inches.
What the reality will bring, we will see soon, as Sony has traditionally unveiled its autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair (IFA), which will take place from September 1-6 this year.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for border wall
The Washington Post unveiled transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, Trump made a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop his public declaration that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States grumbled at him for publicly denouncing the wall, saying, “You mustn’t say that to the press.”
Trump set up his presidential campaign on a pledge to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees to Australia is “laughing,” “stupid,” and “stupid.” He argued that the agreement that was made under Obama’s government would leave him as a “chauffeur” because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant speech of the day.”
The Supreme Court did not hear the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in a case in which the City of Tartu rejected their offer for bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive that rejected the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid on a bus procurement in Tartu because the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This is a public bus service contract within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court against the Tartu Circuit Court’s decision.
The Supreme Court did not deal with this.
While many people complain on social media that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their night’s sleep and the whole city is full of drunken partyers, there are also many who have nothing bad to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the guests at the store were so polite!
I didn't see any obscurity or rudeness.
I saw the kindness," says Laine.
"It's great to be here, and to be happy and to feel the joy of Pärnu, which is like a winter's sleep in winter," he adds cheerfully.
The noise from the beach doesn't disturb Laine's sleep.
While living in the city centre, he still heard music being played on the beach, but now the music has not yet reached his home walls.
"But I hope I can hear you," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who has also spoken with <0xC3><0x95>htuleht, says that the grand festival is rather good for Pärnu – it contributes a lot to the turnover of local merchants.
He is also pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
Party noise doesn't bother a woman.
Although I don't sunbathe on the beach anymore, I'm glad the beach is alive.
And it’s good that people are moving, and it’s been that way three times already,” she says.
The first time it was a little worse.
"Maybe there were complaints," he thought.
However, the noise at the beach is common for summer residents, he said.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri, who plays in the park.
Noise and fuss have not altered his rhythm of life either.
But for what?
We should all stick together.
Think about how this inter-ethnic relationship would be better.
The man of loud music is not crushed.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live right there.
"Good people can keep together and there's no trouble," he says.
The guests who came to Pärnu, he said, were polite.
“Of course, they’ve exaggerated a little with the bottles, but young people are young and, oh, my God, let’s go, but be human and we can do it!” she says.
Coastal residents have travelled somewhere far away by then, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of noise," says Tiina, who walked with children in Pärnu.
His family’s sleep is also not disturbed by the festival music, although last year it sounded even further from this year.
Last summer it was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live outside the city ourselves, so it sounds pretty good there far along the Pärnu River,” he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revive business
British education firm Pearson said Friday it would cut 3,000 more jobs and reduce its interim dividends by 72 percent, launching yet another restructuring program to address the threatening bottlenecks in the business.
The jobs that will be lost, according to CEO John Fallon, are likely to be redundant at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, adding to the 4,000 jobs that were lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut <0xC2><0xA3>300 million (<0x24>394 million) in expenses under the third cost reduction program to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House last month to its partner Bertelsmann, said their expectations for the year have not changed since a 1-percent increase in sales revenues was announced in the first half of the year at <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said the Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked "with a man-carrying self-made explosive device."
According to the statement, all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh is a source of serious concern for NATO forces in Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people, mainly in the Shiite district.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people - the most deadly military attack in the country since the U.S.-led forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
This violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country’s military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and President Ashraf Ghani in particular.
The EPA annulled the decision to postpone the Smog Ordinance after the actions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overturned the decision to delay the introduction of a Obama-era decree that would oblige states to limit smog-causing emissions one day after 15 states sued the agency for this move.
The EPA announced its decision to proceed with “2015 Ozone Detection Procedures” late Wednesday, saying it showed the agency’s commitment to working with states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue and listen to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPA to postpone ozone measurements to determine where the level should be further reduced by one year to meet the stricter air quality standard by October 2018.
Fifteen mostly democratic states filed a lawsuit together with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has tried to reverse a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, which Trump said was part of a broader plan to boost economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhaling ozone-containing air “can reduce the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases,” such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
Pigs and cattle in Germany may be celebrating as heavy rains threaten the EU’s second-largest wheat producer, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it may be that weeks of rainfall before harvesting may mean that the grain intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animal feed.
"Wheat quality is far worse than last year and worse than 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat could be used as animal feed, twice as much as normal, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, as well as their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
At first, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by a heat wave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rainstorms, which have continued in August.
Many have turned their eyes to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only 5% of the wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area has not yet begun harvesting, local harvest buyer Ceravis said.
“These are pretty difficult days,” said Frank Deckert of Rendsburg, a senior trader at Ceravis.
Consistency in everything, perhaps the cunning tricks of Finnish interior design
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of fairhouses, because through the large windows the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
Every step of the way, our northern neighbours are striving to create both crisp and perfect (energy-saving) homes at the same time.
The Finnish people’s skills in using wood as construction and finishing material, in the manufacture of furniture and beauty products deserve admiration and also follow.
Encouraging techniques and clever solutions can be found in fairhouses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It is evident that black, white and gray shadings, when complemented by wood tones and indoor plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked for another week, because the fair will last until 13 August.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
Last night, the line was drawn for this year’s Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix gave his best to be remembered as the last performer on the main stage.
At the time of Garrix's performance, the crowd was truly in a state of change - singing, chanting, dancing in a self-confessed way.
When Garrix finished, a common mass was spread from Pärnu beach to the city.
We will bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer captured during the Weeknd for three days.
You must be one of them, find yourself.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Loachenko meet for the first time to discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face off in the most exciting boxing match of the near future in the weight category of up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were at ESPN’s office in Los Angeles in separate rooms, until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization’s featherweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at the Showtime, both fighters are in the top five of the standings.
Garcia held out her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga at 7 p.m. at ESPN on Saturday night.
While the couple were posing for the photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between fighters would be a "perfect measure."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up for the Broner [63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move below the light weight.
And he has to move upwards with a light weight [61,2 kg], and then we can fight.
The fans wanted it.
So let’s offer it to them.”
Loachenko agreed.
"The world of boxing needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch it. This is part of his strategy to have Lomachenko debut 61.2 kg in the class towards the end of this year, to make it possible to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 novices) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winners of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their light weight on September 23rd.
"Watching this fight could be a payoff because fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying that he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "mighty fighter" and could go watch his Saturday match.
Loachenko, however, was modest in applauding Garcia, saying that he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this nook."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the impact strength and then box.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension growing between them to test their wealth.
“It’s a battle waiting to be realized.
No other confrontation generates so much attention and fuss.
I’m more than willing to work for it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I’ve been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
This is going to be a good fight.”
From which parts of the world are we moving to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record number of more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
When, for example, it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6,702 foreigners last year, the figure was 4,928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis is being prepared by the Ministry of the Interior.
Ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia every year, but in recent years this number is approaching 2,000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014, 1,087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier, 675.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the most in Estonia – last year 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left.
“The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and due to the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural for people to look for work and study opportunities in a country where the community and many families are already ahead of them,” said Kristin Rammus, spokeswoman for the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and since then, the number of Ukrainians who have been granted temporary residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in a total of ten years, the most temporary residence permits have been issued to the latter.
While Ukrainians come here to work, Russian citizens come here mainly for family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the biggest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the Academy of Homeland Security.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have received Estonian residence permits have moved to live, then Ida-Virumaa is immediately behind Harjumaa," he added, pointing out that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1,696 Russian citizens were granted temporary residence permits, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to extend their residence permits decreased.
"The reason for this is that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanent residence in Estonia," Rammus, a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior, said, adding that Russian citizens' interest in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia from the previous year.
Its purpose is to facilitate the stay of adapted people.
A residence permit for a long-term resident, for example, requires five years.
Because of the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has also decreased.
For example, last year, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now the Ukrainians can change jobs, and the Estonian state will no longer make a fuss about whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became hugely popular - applicants last year were still holders of gray passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people received a residence permit to settle in Estonia, among them 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
While three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 were issued last year.
They come from Nigeria to study at these universities.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian citizens has risen largely due to educational migration.
The rule also applies to them, that where a community has formed in advance, it is easier for others to come there," Rammus added.
Over the past ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as well as from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
With around 6,000 third-country nationals receiving a residence permit each year, this represents about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if we count the citizens of the European Union, migration remains at about one per cent," Maasing said.
According to Statistics Estonia, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia last year, while 13,792 migrated out of Estonia last year.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration in the second year.
Most of the expatriates and immigrants are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those who leave.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was negative with 2,000 people last year.
Estonians travel mainly between Finland and Estonia.
Mamma Couture's princess fashion charms with satchels, embroidery and tulle
For Maria Tammeoru, however, the endless idea box is history - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire the old sleeves and collars.
When you do something with passion, you study and learn about it every day.
It is a joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mamma Couture may seem alien to some, but the designer doesn’t think so.
You decide how much light you have in your life.
I have a friend who has a sauna full of haute couture dresses I've created.
Because it’s not her fault that she doesn’t live in Hollywood and she doesn’t walk on the red carpet every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and wears them!
You can make your life special!
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between the bright events and the gray everyday.
It was this reasoning that set in motion the plan to bring high fashion to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people who fashion often does not reach.
Mammu’s collection was presented in V<0xC3><0xB5>ru, J<0xC3><0xB5>hvi and Pärnu fashion hall, where a royal defile with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, people often get hung up, nod dignified, but elsewhere there are more emotions - they shout bravo, stand up, want to thank you by the hand.
Most of the audience just came to reform, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people’s expectations, they will be thrilled!
And I like the feeling of being on a summer tour with my fashion design.
In Pärnu we had a 50 meter long red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed that they would never end!
Maria also does not admit that the creation has to be presented to a supermodel, she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they are always happy to come.
It’s such a fun experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I’m so sorry that I’ve never seen my own performance, because I’m always behind the scenes to give things the final touch as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to watch the hall quietly.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who doesn’t just want to play the role of representation, but wants to be in everything by hand.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, I make most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I'm never far from my work and I'm not afraid of work.
Design is not limited to everything, also stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything has to fit into the day of one temperamental woman.
There is a lot of work for fanatics.
I don’t know when my day will end, it’s just a day full of joy for me.
I’m still very lucky – it’s like an endless chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
It's been said many times that my dresses have magic - they make me feel like a princess.
The saturated lines of tilt that made Maria’s talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp on the U18 boys: the weapon of the Estonian sub-group tournament was now turned against us
Sorry, we ran out of fairy tales.
The first thing we noticed was that we couldn't get to our table.
And if there is such a big difference at the table, there is nothing to do," commented Martin Müürsepp, BC Kalev/Cramo’s assistant coach, on Estonia’s U18 basketball team’s 61:75 defeat to the UK.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attacking table and received so many more attacks as a result.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack, either.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build a defense.
In protection, however, they managed to hold hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It knocked the crew down.
My opponent’s homework was better done.
According to Müürsepp, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to slow down the pace of its opponents.
In the last quarter, we had zero errors, but our opponents have already gotten several quick baskets.
The athleticism and intense push, which was our weapon in the sub-group tournament, now turned against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The mason was at peace with his ward in Kalevi, Matthias Tass.
In general, good words can be said about the whole team in the tournament, until today there was a single kick fist.
It's a pity you've met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been self-confident and still played out his own today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has carried quite a load.
But he made some really nice moves that I've seen before in training," added the supervisor.
Terrible numbers: the girls’ basketball team scored less than 10 points in three quarters of the European Championship...
In the U18 age class, not only the young men’s European Championship B-division basketball tournament is taking place in Tallinn, the girls started yesterday in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, caught on to the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but still after the third quarter it was 9:49, so it was only in the last ten minutes that the opponents took their foot off the accelerator pedal and that period remained in the draw at 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4 points, in the third 1 point...
At the same time, Estonian women hit two of the first four shots in two minutes, then 25 of the game, then one of the three and then 21 more shots...
Within half an hour, 47 shots were fired.
Two of the four free throws came in.
There was a reasonable number of shots at that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland scored 33 percent and Estonia scored 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two defeats, on the opening day we had to admit the best of Portugal 83:56.
NATO ships come to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO’s 1st permanent anti-mine group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit for the weekend to replenish the ships’ reserves and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare for the return to the sea and give crew members the opportunity to rest for a couple of days.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and be ready for future operations to search for historical explosives.
"The participation of the Estonians in the NATO unit and the co-operation training carried out by them in local waters clearly demonstrates our integration with the allied forces," said the Commander of the Operations and Planning Division in charge of the Commander of the Navy's Fleet, Major Arto Reinmaa.
From 29 June, NATO’s 1st permanent mine control group will be led by Latvian naval commander Gvido Laudups, who at the ceremony in Riga took over the duties of group leader from Estonian naval officer Captain Johan-Elias from Seljamaa.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian Navy support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, on which the group’s command team also operates.
This semester, the international unit also includes Sakala, a mine hunter for the Estonian Navy.
As one of the four groups of ships under NATO's naval command, NATO's 1st Permanent Mine Defence Team is a preparedness unit belonging to the Primary Rapid Reaction Force, which the Alliance can deploy to various parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Monastery will once again become the place where the Birgitta Festival, founded 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klas, will be held.
This year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joost, artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic Orchestra (36).
Risto Joost: The classics of the opera world include "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet performances from the enchanting "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson", and the production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio "Seasons" by the same international creative team who brought the same production to the stage in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre productions.
It's bigger than any musical theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival that's won't let go of again.
For the experience that the listener receives in this lofty and mysterious environment makes the human souls ring and touches the human senses in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't Maestro Eri Klas' shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been very helpful.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of my conducting career.
This may make it easier for me to continue my work.
Eri Klas has injected so much kindness into the Birgitta Festival team and of course it all goes to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things are going.
It was the great heart of Eri Klas that gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am and I can do it!
What could inspire the audience at this year’s festival, what do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet, written for the narrative of Astrid Lindgren, will be presented.
It's called "Karlsson Flying."
And one of the strange nuances of this ballet is that it was written by the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a wish to write this work.
She has probably had a Karlsson character since she was a child.
Risto, how can you handle all this?
Definitely thanks to my supportive partner.
This kind of work requires a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have plenty of that.
And I’ve noticed that my personal emotions don’t depend as much on other people as they do on me, or how I face each new day.
And this conscious tone-keeping, keeping positive, and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, significantly increased my happiness percentage.
Especially this week, when there are the most important samples, I have been particularly diligent in practicing it, and it works.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I think people don't know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them, but they're slowly discovering it for themselves.
Right now, this is an important moment.
Do you have any rituals before the conductor walks into the remote?
You have to change your clothes for more comfortable ones.
This is a small moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest or take a nap before the big show.
In fact, I even like to interact with people actively, even before I step into the conductor’s booth.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here is something to discover for a not too great opera and ballet friend!
Watch the video with Risto Joost!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers published
The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the people tested were older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing early this year.
The tests were created to further assess the age during the asylum application process after criticisms were made against the Swedish Migrations Verket for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly minor refugees.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has released a total of 2,481 test results between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated 18 years or older, and in another 25 cases, the Forensic Institute estimated that the test subject “may be 18 years or older.”
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person is "presumably younger than 18".
Tests are only used when the age of a person is in question.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
“We don’t see a big difference from previous months’ statistics, the numbers are pretty consistent,” he told The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of the cases were rated older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the Institute released the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person being studied is 18 years or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet looked at the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases the person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical age-assessment method, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints are taken and then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, whose duties include assessing the biological maturity of humans to determine whether they passed puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I’ve had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the measurement method we’re using now should be used.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say for sure, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of imprecisely categorizing a child into adulthood is low.
The highest risk, perhaps 10%, is when a person is just under 18.”

20-year-old Anna Maria Orel made her beautiful debut at the World Championships in London, getting a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female hammerman at the World Cup, and a cheerful woman confirmed that she hoped to fight for the medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
With the first attempt (64.80) I immediately scored my average result, with the second (62.80) I risked too much and with the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
The debut of Anna Maria Orel ended with a good 18th place.
The rain didn’t bother Orel, because he is training through the winter at TUT stadium.
"I'm a tempered one," he said with a little smile.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, could Orel sense people around him or could he shut himself off?
I know, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds up - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be satisfied with the debut of the World Cup and that he will have a lot of good competitions ahead of him: "I came here with the 32nd or final result of this season, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very decent result.
I’m 20 years old and that’s the only thing that matters.
I have a great experience and some days I want to compete for medals.
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Party
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a meeting with President Trump that he would switch parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," Justice said.
“Today I say to you, after much prayer and reflection, today I say to you, the West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as the democratic governor.”
There was joy at the gathering.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
“As a coach, I’d tell you it’s time to play another game.”
Trump had previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the state’s only billionaire, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
Its value is approximately <0x24>1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night that "the change of governor Justice's party is yet another blow to the democratic party that would rather prevent the country from getting better than working for it."
“With only 15 governorship seats and control over the lowest number of states in history, the governor’s Justice announcement is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is head-to-head and unable to find a positive and unifying message,” RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Not surprisingly, where there are many people, there are many injured.
Urmet, who works in a medical tent at the weekend, told <0xC3><0x95>htuleht yesterday that they had to distribute quite a lot of patches.
Wounds and abrasions are basic, twists and slight falls.
Head, back and foot pains, of course.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes and that’s how the problems come.
The medics have also had to help a few more injured visitors - there have been a few panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also done stitches when a person has broken a hand or a finger.
Smaller stitches are done here, bigger ones are sent to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if the celebrities ask the medics for painkillers to treat hangovers.
Coe apologises to Russians for doping scandal
International athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia's "honest apology for Thursday's doping scandal" but reiterated that this is not the time to allow the country to return to sport.
Russian athlete Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country’s ban on competition is correct and has a clear goal to fight doping.
He apologised to “all the athletes from whom the gold and silver medals have been stolen.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on competitions imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian sub-federation itself acknowledged that they have had quite difficult times and are doing everything possible to restructure the sub-federation."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its recovery.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and there is progress, but Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the right time to take back Russia," Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.
Following a report to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that the anti-doping controls were still inadequate and that the banned trainers were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that they will win in one place and lose in the other, smaller mining companies will not be helped.
Today, Glencore earns from coal and oil, but in the future, in the era of electric cars, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel will grow.
This year, the British, French and Norwegian governments have decided to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
That’s why Volvo has already announced that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla is launching a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more electric cars have been sold in the last two decades than cars that use oil-produced fuels.
"For some metals, it changes everything," said Simona Gambranini, a raw material analyst at Capital Economics, to Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on such metals as cobalt and lithium, the demand for which has been increasing for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, Glencore said.
More copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates it will increase copper demand by about 5% by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore is profiting from the rising trend in electric cars from rising copper prices and being the world’s largest cobalt producer, the Jefferies Group predicted.
According to this brokerage firm, the other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, the Cobalt has increased by 70 percent on the London Metal Exchange.
The price increase last year was 37%.
Copper has also increased by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore’s stock rose 20 percent in London, after surpassing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billito and Anglo American.
On the losing side are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine, who have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is batteries supplying power to car starters with petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless other uses are found to overcome the drop in demand," Michael Widmer, Metal Market Analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a statement.
The effects of the unfolding trend have not yet been noticed in the form of lead price movements.
Lead has risen 17 percent this year, making it the best metal in London among the major industrial metals to rise in price.
Investors will only see problems with metal in the distant future.
"I'm not sure it's that bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at Triland Metals.
When the demand for lead drops, it happens slowly.
This could happen in about 10 years.
In the meantime, stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depend on advanced lead-based batteries for frequent engine start-ups, is growing, according to the international research organisation for lead and zinc.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel, as a lighter car can drive farther with less electricity.
This explains the additional demand for aluminium of 1.6 million tonnes already between 2013 and 2016.
It accounts for 2.7 percent of the world’s aluminium production.
This trend is likely to worsen, Widmer said.
Aluminium has increased by 13% this year, as the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is partnering with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce lightweight car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy steel to resist aluminum.
"Transient steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
We see some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to the platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was spent on diesel-powered car catalysts, metal refiner Johnson Matthey said.
"Many of the raw materials in high demand today, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, a raw material analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers expect continued demand for diesel-hybrid cars.
Uncore CEO Marc Grynberg said that by 2025, more hybrid cars will be sold than full-electric cars.
A great hope for platinum manufacturers over the next 10 years is that Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos will develop hydrogen cell-based cars that depend on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, this technology has not yet proven itself commercially.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," Brunet of Exane BNP Paribas said.
German car manufacturers were hit hard in July after a Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the hometowns of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How Football Financial Rules Affect Neymar's Transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from making the world record move from the Spanish football club Barcelona to the French club Paris-Saint Germain.
“Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that controls the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are just waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
The Fair Play Financial Rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar’s transfer was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million (<0x24>262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar’s salary is set to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to the French club.
PSG will no doubt be able to raise this kind of money to recruit Neymar and add it to its stellar lineup, given that the team is funded by the Qatari energy rich family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players, but they have to balance this with legal sources of income that allow them to get out of the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fell into high debt in search of success actually engaged in fraud and risked ruin if banks or owners were to give up support.
Since 2011, the FFP has focused on monitoring the losses of clubs instead of their debts.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with potential and then make a big expense to improve the team and create a global brand – is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period of FFP, which will run until 2018, clubs may suffer losses of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite Platini’s disgraceful expulsion from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excess spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules in the future," said Andrea Traverso, a UEFA FFP overseer, to The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid for the Neymar buy-out clause in a single payment, it is possible for them to split this amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract, which makes it possible to show the transitional fee over the next five years as an amount of EUR 44,4 million over the year.
For the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, along with Manchester City from Abu Dhabi, received the most severe penalties.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (at the moment <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to outsmart regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies affiliated with club owners.
The Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the support from the Qatar Tourism Authority for PSG was bloated.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar’s PSG service could come from Qatar through payments made by the 2022 World Cup Management Committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador to the World Cup, and argue that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a maneuver.
Penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any attempt to disregard the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition of Neymar with PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG made more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million in profit in the 2015-2016 season, with a turnover of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
The data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymar will have a positive impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects at least a 30% increase in turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, attempted to prevent Neymar from making the transition, claiming that PSG was violating the FFP by doing so.
"This is a clear case of 'monetary doping' with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG is primarily owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports magnate, shares La Liga’s view that the state is funding the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape over the past 15 years," Wenger said.
“If the club is owned by the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as a country may have other ways or interests to represent such a big player.”

Today, 50 years ago: a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that tore the roofs and windows of houses.
Hurricane called the storm of the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August caused major damage, especially to Lääne County, Harju County and Rapla County.
During these days, the wind speed in northwestern Estonia was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and violent, like the end of the world.
The roofs were already flying from the houses, old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu recalled in 2002 in an interview given to Eesti Loodus magazine.
Linda's husband saw the garden he planted collapse.
But what do you do with your hands to support the trees, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, water splashed through the windows," said Mrs Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu at the time.
That the roads were full of trees and that the roof of the railway station’s platform had flown 20-30 meters, Linda could not see until the next morning, like most of the Haapsalu people.
Locals say the trees behind Paralepa were lying on the ground, some completely lying down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm passed through the beautiful old trees with rags and cracks like a war.
Lääne-Virumaa was not particularly badly affected by the August storm of 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was also great there, Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped off the face of the earth, but the parks around us were also severely damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speeds of up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour, were measured.
On the evening of the 6th of August, a little girl in Merivälja, Tallinn, cried: "Mama, mom!
The chickens are in the air and can’t get down!” wrote Virumaa Teataja.
The P<0xC3><0xB5>lli manor building in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm to such an extent that it was decided to demolish later.
The constructions of Türi ski jumping hill, which were not restored later, did not withstand the August Storm.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star newspaper reported that the cleaning of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches was progressing slowly, and residents could join in the cleaning work.
Grain fields were also severely affected by the storm, and the newspaper stated that "Party organisations must be the inspiration and guide for both cleaning and harvesting."
We can talk about hurricanes when the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The wind speed record in Estonia has been maintained since 2 November 1969, when the wind speed at Ruhnu was measured at 48 m/s.
On Vaindloo Island, the instrument broke, so the speed of the strong winds measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean beaches: night cleaning and poor beach weather
The colder summer weather also means less cleaning in Tallinn’s beaches.
"If there is no weather, then there are people on the beach, and if there are no people, then there are no people," says the beach cleaner.
There are gulls screaming at the Stroomi beach in Northern Tallinn.
They are offered melodic competition by a low-revving tractor that plows down stripes on the plaise.
In fact, the last one sifts through the sand from a depth of seven centimetres, picking out sea debris and people’s leftovers: bottle caps, cigarette cigarettes, and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is hot or not.
When the weather is nice, people are on the beach, and when there are no people, there are no people," says Aleksandr Usov, head of beach cleaning at Haabersti Haldus.
It's 6.30 a.m. and there's a lot of cleaning going on at the beach, because at 8 a.m. the place has to be clean for people.
Usov's on the job since 4:00.
Apart from Stroom, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakar beach.
Waste volumes have decreased.
Years ago there was much more.
People are now able to appreciate what is done for them," says Usov, who has been cleaning beaches for 15 years.
Before that, when something new was set up, it was already broken the next day.
What is on the beach is now being kept.
Price for a clean beach
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the cleaning of sea litter, or adru, washed up on the shore.
For example, at Pirita beach, 400,000 tons have to be transported during this beach season.
"That's an incredible amount," says Usov.
The second major category is household waste, i.e. all that people leave behind.
The one-and-a-half-kilometer Stroom beach has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
So much garbage.
However, the colder summer weather has meant that there is a fifth less garbage than otherwise.
The third species consists of abandoned things.
It's mostly kids' bones.
This time, Usov has shoveled a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They will be waiting for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
"Usually more of them will come out, but it's a normal harvest." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
The children come to the beach and take the toys to drown them in the sand again.
The garbage is torn apart
Erika Scholler, a representative of Haabersti’s administrative services, admits that the work of screening the tractor is disturbing the locals.
The noise, which lasts from night hours to early morning, disturbs the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
During the day, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach should be screened twice.
"If we don't do this, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
However, like Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu, the goal is to get Stroomi beach under the international blue flag quality label.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to make sure the beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We have more plums and stones and harder to sift through the sand.
There is less rubbish on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
When Martin, who lives near Stroomi beach, hears about garbage on the beach, he enters the conversation circle of the journalist and cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
Every morning there are pictures everywhere.
The problem is with the birds and bottle collectors who have pulled the garbage bags upside down,” says Martin.
While it’s hard to assume that people can change their current habits, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about the garbage cans and put covers on them, for example, to prevent at least the birds from visiting the city.
In general, however, Martin is pleased with the development of Stroomi beach.
You can see that the city is taking care of it.
With children's courts, illuminated and freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
It was once the case that you could only ride one road on rollerblades,” notes Martin.
Findings of the treasure hunter in Stromi: coins, only coins
The 40-year-old Dimitri, a treasure hunter, has had to take advantage of the morning tsunami by scrubbing the shoreline with a metal detector.
He does not believe that he will find anything valuable today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough.
"I've been working on this for a year and so far I haven't found anything of value," says Dmitri.
As a hobby treasurer, Dmitri’s treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails, which later throws them in the trash.
There are usually coins.
"There is usually no gold, no rings, no such thing," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at their previous levels, as weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish, as households’ stalled incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The policymakers of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep the 6:2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members are calling for an increase this month as slow growth has weakened support for growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household incomes will remain, as inflation is still expected to rise to close to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank also signalled that the increase in rates will be necessary to curb inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years, and a higher-than-expected rise in credit costs may be necessary in the financial markets.
Members also voted to partially withdraw the mammoth package that was launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end its fixed-term financing scheme in February, offering banks cheap financing, although it said that a bid of <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion, <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion, is now expected under this scheme.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the Bank states: "In the medium-term forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of households' real incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
With regard to rates, it was reiterated that a "slight tightening of monetary policy" is needed to alleviate inflation, and this at a "slightly higher" rate than the markets have expected.
The stock market is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that all jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for 2018 of 1.8 percent growth remained stable.
After this news, the pound dropped against the dollar and the euro.
The pound dropped 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened the growing hopes of rising GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank’s latest inflation report gave little reason to cheer households suffering from rising inflation and unfortunate wage increases, saying that the situation would get a little worse before it improved.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent a shock to incomes in the next few years, but wages are expected to recover noticeably towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by a growing demand for British production, which partly compensates for lower consumer costs.
The decision comes a year after the rates were moved to 0.25% last August after a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to suddenly weaken.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully inflate prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank’s last decision, there was a growing demand for an increase in the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on tightly-knit households; in July, three policymakers called for a 0.5% increase in the rate.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected and a rise awaits in the coming months.
The bank said the excess growth compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent fall in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more and more competitive again as lenders crave work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock market seems particularly favorable for those whose current transactions are starting to come to an end, as refinancing, often free of charge and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular."
The NHS is prescribing a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people.
As of September, patients will have access to “transformative” HIV preventative treatment after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
The NHS England reported that the National Health Service is now making pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) available to an estimated 10,000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial, a tablet administered before intercourse that has shown a reduction of about 86% in the risk of infection in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Appellate Court backed last year’s ruling that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the NHS’s own claims that the drug should be funded by local governments instead.
NHS England CEO Simon Stevens welcomed this move, which was announced Thursday, as a “new large-scale intervention,” while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as “a pivotal moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people. More clinics will be added in October before the program is deployed everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
The results of clinical trials indicate that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there is a sufficient amount of certain drugs in the human body that prevent infection with HIV.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before intercourse.
Candidates eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment.
Clinicians identify suitable individuals who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register at a local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and NHS England signed a contract to receive the drugs this week after an international tender.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence about who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in the big picture.
Stevens said: “This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the broad and increasingly successful fight against HIV transmission.
This is yet another milestone in more than three decades of combating one of humanity’s greatest health problems.”
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said: “This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high risk of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and not dependent on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives through this NHS-funded clinical trial.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “It is now essential to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is pushed quickly and that no person at risk of HIV is left out.
Now that the clinical trial drug for PrEP has been procured, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.
Public Health shadow minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and much delayed after months of delays and dragging the government’s feet.
Evidence shows how much this medicine can change to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial be implemented across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia and decreased in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference between the next day’s exchange price of electricity between Estonia and the price areas of Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the breakdown of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
The average exchange price of electricity in Estonia last month was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the system price of the power exchange Nord Pool was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12% and 7%, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75 per cent of last month’s hours in the direction of Estonia and 16 per cent of last month’s hours from Estonia to Finland.
Nine per cent of the remaining hours were spent without next-day transactions between the two countries.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity moved from Estonia to Latvia for 99 per cent of the time and 73 per cent of the hours had all the transmission capacity in use.
According to the transactions that took place on the last trading day of July in the Nasdaq OMX market, the exchange price for electricity could be approximately 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the production price of electricity rose last month, and transactions took place at a price of 5.04-5.47 euros per tonne.
Living in K<0xC3><0xB5>rgelu - Half-floor and clever design tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, switched her big Knightsbridge home to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived on a much larger surface with my ex-partner in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
“I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.”
Since its first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed in Notting Hill to take advantage of the 3.8-metre-high ceilings to create a home that was not just a development project, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-floor where one could stand upright.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
“We had to rearrange the rooms so that they were on top of each other without having to bend over.
It wasn’t just about building a platform, we used a steel structure to make sure that both the upper and lower spaces were the right height.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms on top of each other in the room, with plenty of dramatic elements.
From the half-floor, the old copper-lighted Retrouvius window offers a view of the glamorous living space below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver details and the retro Serge Mouille luminaire accentuate the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spaciousness and light saturation.
Mirrors are added at both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers storage for all Joanne’s cutlery and glassware.
The possibility to close the kitchen when not in use adds charm to the living room, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this kitchen, however, is that it is a garage-type sliding door.
“There was a bit of a design problem,” explains Erfan, a steel-strengthened MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when pushed up."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne now has an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
“After all, floor space is what you sell – or what gives value to real estate,” says Erfan.
"The real estate agent enters the room in an obsolete form and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here, they have been able to increase the floor space by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
“The materials are the ones you touch that help create an emotional bond with your home,” says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical wiring on the wall.
This is important, but it does not make the tongues of the heart ring.”
This shows that a good design and an enlarged area will help to turn a fairly ordinary apartment into something amazing.
In fact, they may even create a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
Dane Jensen is a bounty hunter from the Chicago skyscraper who competes with a colleague for promotion.
All that counts is the amount of money earned, and all ethics are forgotten.
He only sees his wife and three children early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that this is the business version of "The House of Cards" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speeches are similar.
The further the film goes, the less the frame-like element remains, and the moralizing intentions of the filmmakers begin to emerge more and more.
A life-changing experience for the protagonist will be the illness of his son with cancer.
We now have to make a choice between work and family life.
A dreamy son of an architect takes his father on a walk to the big Chicago buildings to think about things that are truly important, such as faith, goodness, love... not even the catastrophe of the twin towers goes unnoticed.
After the third scene, in which the son opens his father’s eyes, there is a feeling that the filmmakers are determined to make the audience cry, because even the most heartless viewer can’t hold back tears from seeing the suffering of a cute, cancer-sick boy.
When the son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally understands the immorality of his work and does a good deed to an old man looking for work.
Now I’m betting on myself – if the movie has a happy ending, I’ll reward my clarity with coffee after the movie, but if I’m wrong, the writer can praise me for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there’s a suspicion that I’m going to lose my coffee—when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he rushes slow-motion down the hallway toward the room.
The son, however, has been miraculously healed, and although his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be a positive one, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good about myself - I can already predict the end of the American drama quite well!
To be honest, the film is well-designed, and all the necessary elements are in place.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morals are beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I think this movie will do well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to cut the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new White House chief of staff plans to curb the flow of information reaching President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in smoother water.
Here's an excerpt from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior officials on his first working day, he pointed out a key problem President Donald Trump had in the White House, which he planned to solve by getting bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told officials that information must flow through him, either on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis seems entirely logical, but others have also tried, and they have failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades, and now that he’s in the White House, his television habits haven’t disappeared.
"When Trump was angry about the unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also being honestly reported in the affected publications," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “six former campaigners said that the key to managing Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption consistently includes praise.”
All right, all right.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habits have once been “controlled” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something the rest of us don’t know that Trump’s tweets would have been even more incendiary without their intervention.
We’ll probably never know about the tweets Trump didn’t post.
When his helpers were able to save him from trouble even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from consistently causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of competing clicks, people are exclusively trying to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldview, but may not always be reliable.
In May, Politico wrote about the inclination of the advisers to feed the president with information of questionable strategic value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
“Current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump may react to negative press, particularly information leaks with damaging effects, explosively, obsessing about identifying their source.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone gave the president a photocopy of an article on the GotNews.com website belonging to internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson that accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being a "source of multiple information leaks" from the White House.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of the mockery, or that he didn’t provide any specific evidence, or that he has also filed false accusations in the past and withdrew them.
Trump read the article and started asking his subordinates about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that then chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House chief of staff Rob Porter “have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents reaching Trump.”
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming from abroad to the capital will not be allowed to perform bitterly.
There are a lot of foreigners playing music in the city centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom <0xC3><0x95>htuleht talked admitted that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the city council.
First we found three street musicians near the gates of Viru, who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear that the musicians in razor patches and bursting clothes were backpackers who could use a shower to berries.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the group played a story with a fun rhythm on the accordion, while a man next to her juggled with three balls and called the passers-by closer.
The third man had sat next to them on a backpack and smoked a self-made twisted lump in the heartbeat.
These three dogs did not let themselves be disturbed by the passing people.
Noemi, who played the accordion, and Bob, who juggled the balls, said they were playing on the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the group’s performance was to collect ticket money for a ship sailing to Finland the same evening.
When asked if they asked the city for permission to play music in the old town, Noem and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we never stay in a city for more than a day or two, and most of the time, permissions are given for a month or so.
There's no point in paying for it," Bob explained.
When we came back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with the musicians and were driving them away.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to the intersection of the Viru centre to try their luck.
Three Polish young men also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played the violin, the other the clarinet and the third had even carried an electronic piano with him.
"We're here to entertain people, to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living," said Mivosh, a trio pianist.
According to Mivosh, they are aware that a permit from the city government is required to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we’ll go somewhere else, but we have to try,” he added.
Eesti Pank purchased bonds worth EUR 149 million in July as part of the euro area central banks’ public sector asset purchase programme, and the central bank’s bond portfolio grew to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank does not publish any more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained, in response to an interpellation by members of the Riigikogu, that the Eurosystem central banks’ asset purchase programme includes three different purchase programmes: financial sector covered bonds, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who have sold the bonds to invest their money elsewhere.
The effect of purchases is to reduce the return on lower-risk assets and to motivate investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, each central bank purchases government bonds under a public sector bond purchase programme, while bonds from other countries are not purchased.
As the state of Estonia has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank will make so-called replacement purchases within the allocated volume.
The central banks also purchase substitution bonds in countries where the supply of bonds complying with the purchase programme is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally purchases bonds from European institutions, such as those of the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds under the asset purchase programme as of March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were also acquired, but from June 2016 Eesti Pank will no longer purchase Elering bonds.
The Bank of Finland will purchase Elering and Eesti Energia bonds on behalf of the central banks of the euro area from June.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaires' district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have once again found themselves in a frenzied confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored a trench dug by the council to win back a field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field near Solihull Street, a wealthy “millionaires’ district”.
They have returned with the army of horses, children, and trucks since they were only kicked out in May, without letting themselves be disturbed by a trench dug up by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot in the barrier, squeezing their vehicles through the unbarred part that had been left as a footpath.
Raven-hated residents have cursed the Solihull council, saying that the council is "useless in dealing with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after their expulsion from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The council must be shamed to take action, because they are useless in tackling the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
They came last night, probably more today.”
He added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook road and I am not happy that I have to continue to pay the council tax if the council is not even able to prevent such a thing.”
A local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said, "This is ridiculous. We just saw the last of these travelers leave, and a new attack is already taking place.
This time the number has increased and even a horse has been seen ruminating in the grassland."
A representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unauthorized campground in the country near Streetsbrook Road, and we will cooperate with the Solihull Police. We will take the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
Evidence gathering can be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
Among others, Minister of Culture Indrek Saar will also visit the Weekend Festival, who is pleased that real world top names have been brought to Estonia.
Asked why the Weekend Festival is so important to Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the three days of the festival to the fullest.
However, he admits that the real players in his field have come to Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, they bring home the absolute top names of this genre of music - this often does not happen in our region," says the Minister of Culture.
Which artists at the festival speak for themselves the most?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for people like me, one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
“We’ve all been on our feet at some point,” he says.
There are many other names, including Chainsmokers, Deadmau5 and Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian makers too: starting with NO<0xC3><0x8B>P and you can read a whole line of them.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high,” he says.
Take a closer look at the evening video.
Audi to renew up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in the midst of criticism from car manufacturers
The day before the announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to BMW, the company believes that “there are smarter options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities, including BMW’s hometown of Munich, which have been considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described these actions as recalls.
European car manufacturers have been keen to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitric oxide released from diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment installed to neutralise diesel vehicle emissions will increase for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is also accused of pampering powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen’s mistakes, who silenced the use of so-called scam devices that allowed the exhaust gas readings to be adjusted to the regulations during the car’s testing, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
The former head of the thermodynamics division of the Audi engine development department in Germany was arrested last month.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be prosecuted in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused Audit of installing a system to circumvent European emissions requirements, thereby expanding an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be a huge blow for Volkswagen’s luxury car manufacturer to generate a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen’s profits.

The estimated cost of 570 flags is 20,000 euros, according to the Ministry of Education, i.e. one flag will cost 35 euros.
Reporter's Murder Reveals Growing Threat in Mexico
Riodoce employees usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect on the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, sown by organized crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But today, in the shadow of a personal tragedy, they have gathered together to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routine.
Two senior journalists are discussing which seems safer: either to bring the children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the top of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to provide names in each column, no need for evidence, just impressions and intuition.
Government or cartel wages are suspected of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists, a whole list of villains who make the coverage of the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the greater the number of corpses accumulated across the country, there have been at least 25,589 journalists under national protection since President Enrique Pena Nieto’s inauguration in December 2012, and at least seven journalists have been killed since the attacks and threats.
Among the dead are their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence makes a deep feeling, although his presence can be felt everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building, a large picture of Valdez, pointing to the middle finger with the letter “Justice,” and two 30-year-old reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his characteristic Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss joint trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As with most annual homicides involving drug trafficking and organised crime, which amount to thousands, journalist killers rarely go to court.
Riodoce's editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data of the murderers and justice, the security meeting will not be of much use, according to Ibarra.
"It's very silly to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"Until the cause is known, you will distrust everyone."
Valdez left Riodoce's office in Culiacan on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and was shot 12 times. This is presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates to "twelfth river".
An armed man drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors are spreading freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is only silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival cliques struggle to fill the power vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that the streets of Sinaloa are shot every day by a few people, or even by several, or that the cemetery is overflowing with richly decorated double drug king mausoleums that are larger than the homes of many living people.
For a moment, let us forget that peacetime refers to the fact that a seaside state with its valuable ports and drug routes to the United States is ruled by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce’s co-founder and manager, Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels tremendous remorse that he couldn’t protect his friend.
He believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a crackdown on the cartel’s rivals with Guzman’s sons.
This piece of writing may have angered the sons, and suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newsstands.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid on another newspaper editorial about the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his assassination is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always exist.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce by selling <0x24>50 shares.
Bojorquez said Sinaloa was "impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
Over time, the newspaper gained recognition with its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising increased.
The reporters liked to publish vigorous research without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by the publication, from which they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its coverage of Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (ACJ) for his courage to follow Mexican narcotics wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said when accepting the AKK prize.
Last October, he told Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
“You have to accept the task that comes with being a journalist, the second option is to play dumb.
“I don’t want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn’t tell you what was going on.”
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who snarled like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared emotions and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from his office across the street to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also caused them to doubt themselves how to do their job best and stay alive.
“They don’t like you messing with their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.”
"These things were not to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-sufficiency even in the best of times.
Confidence in your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Riodoce’s editor Andres Villarreal said the problem was that “the sense of smell can be cheated... and that’s what happened to Javier.”
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they no longer apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, or other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce’s employees met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that spyware sold only to governments had been used in Mexico to track journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two policemen were looking for relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
The government ordered them to guard the Riodoce office, which is located in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters half-jokingly wondered if these policemen were among the 50 percent of the police officers the governor himself has branded unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to mountainous rural areas where de facto drug gangs are in control.
Riodoce's publication this week covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor’s hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement as to who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time to be careful when it came to writing down what everyone in the city knows the restaurant is a favorite of drug dealers as well as the authorities.
The reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered to a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the entire last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in widely reported cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how Guzman's son, nicknamed El Chapo, escaped from a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez column to find out about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose sticky physique has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels with our sources have been cut off."
The Valdez office has become a storage space for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never expected from activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of signs and headed to the local prosecutor’s office the next morning for a demonstration over another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n three days after the murder of Valdez.
A burnt body was found, and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists all over the country have become more vocal and are crippling the phrase "SOS press" as an organized protest against sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to gather international support to bring justice to the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Subsequently, he asked to be diverted from reflecting the government’s actions, worrying that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said Mexican journalists were “introduced” by organized crime, co-conspirators, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but are also killed under the orders of politicians and security forces who are in shackles with organised crime.
The Articulo 19 media monitoring group attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and state officials.
"In Mexico, you're going to die because you're going to be silenced," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously bloodthirsty.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in Tamaulipas, a northern border state.
His body was found with a letter, probably signed by the Los Zetas cartel, "I'm here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to his cut-off head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after their correspondent Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others continue to do what the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug cartel with an editorial on the front cover, “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.
This is a nervous decision.
In exile, it’s hard to find a job and they still have to stalk the streets to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexico apartment in 2015 three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work will have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that the coverage of the drug business scares him.
"Mexico is on its way to hell and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest issue had already been locked, Riodoce’s editors were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office and sipping beer when suddenly everyone’s phones started vibrating.
In the coastal resort of Mazatlan, 19 people were killed in firefights between rival gangs and security forces, according to confirmed reports.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the region.
From the edge of the sidewalk, reporters posted the news using a mobile phone on Riodoce's website.
The next day, the front cover needed to be changed.
Sirens waving along another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the guards to see if they were alert.
If they were afraid, they didn’t at least show it.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his middle finger can be seen all over Sinaloa, Riodoce's workers were editing in his footsteps.
"How could you even think about closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send him to the streets to do a reportage?"
Dinosaur used protective color to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a shape, albeit quite frightening.
Scientists have now revealed the first findings of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that its scaled skin was reddish-brown in color and its past had been somewhat "complex".
A report published in Current Biology described the creature as “the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found” and “one of the best dinosaurs in the world.”
The fossil is a new species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation struck scientists who describe it as “really remarkable.”
This scaled-up vegetarian is the best-preserved type of fossil ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he dug a Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray, North Alberta, Canada.
He struck something that did not resemble the surrounding rock, and decided to investigate more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, efforts were made to excavate the animal from a 2,500-pound (1,100-pound) plot of land.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be brought to the public's attention.
"If you pee a little, you can almost believe he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
While examining his skin, researchers found that this herbivore, though covered in scales and resembling a walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
This large scaled dinosaur used red and white to hide from predators, and used a shading technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This, according to experts, allowed the dinosaur to better blend into the surroundings and avoid enemies, as the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family first appeared in the news in May and is now a visitor to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a labyrinth at the Borealopelta Markmitchelli Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exposing the animal.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal's body.
They discovered a counter-eclipse, a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower half.
Although counter-eclipse is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the animals that live today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred shading as a survival tactic over confrontation.
But most of the animals that today use counter-shadowing — such as deer, zebras, or armadillos — are much smaller and more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that nodosaurs had to really work hard to survive.
"The intense hunting of the hugely large and plentiful scaled dinosaur shows how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaur predators could have been," Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the scales also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the contents of its intestines, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell in the river when it died, reaching the sea with a stream, where it sank in front of its back to the ocean floor.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans probably stretched far beyond the hinterland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scalloped skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as it did in the Cretaceous period.
You don’t have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it – it’s enough just to squint your eyes and it feels like it’s asleep.”
The Cretaceous era was a time when huge two-legged carnivorous dinosaurs - the theropods - roamed the earth.
Although their king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of his formidable predecessors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5-meter) tall monster weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was washed into the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he dug up a Millenium mine near Fort McMurray, North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and it is comprehensive from cone to hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch squirrels came out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this scaled herbivore was adventurous through present-day Western Canada until a flooded river washed up in its high seas.
However, the dinosaur’s submarine burial site helped preserve its scales in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered along the armoured plates along the dinosaur skulls.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "This degree of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it looks.
The hardened skin remains still cover the lumpy shell plates on the animal's skull.
His right foreleg lies beside him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on his feet."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked.
Just the day after traveling to New York City, this resident of St. Louis sat in a rented room through Airbnb, browsing Facebook on his phone.
He got into a post from his former schoolmate.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and he's still on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information in his stream, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
The <0x40>TheePharoah user's posts had been shared repeatedly on his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area broadcasted a real-time tweet about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
She put her phone down, but later that night saw another tweet announcing this time a gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
They shared photos of a police tape and screaming people, and a man claiming to be Brown’s father, holding a sign that said, “Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!”
He watched a live stream where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer whispered a rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he hit himself with the thought, "It's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to, which we might call typical."
I felt fear at that moment.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., he went to his father to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that the next morning they would travel alone to Ferguson.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary Whose Streets?, which will premiere in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and a matching crown on her head, approached Ferguson, they again discussed the experiences and living conditions of the blacks, which had been discussed many times before that morning.
“Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?” she recalls, asking herself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
“What is happening now is the culmination of what has happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the midst of it.
He must learn about activism and organization, and at the same time know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we must do to become free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her without personally experiencing blatant racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do him a disservice if I protected him from this world.”
The first stop they made when they reached Ferguson was on South Florissant, a place across the road from the police station, which had become a kind of campground where activists were waiting for news about policeman Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared lunches.
They put food bags together and helped to distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Association of Minorities Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any organizational experience.
It all just went wrong.”
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met with one of the film's co-directors, Sabah Folayan.
Folayan said he and filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was going on.
Ferrell asked, “Are you trying to document what’s going on, or are you trying to find a story that can be used?”
Such skepticism was the result of countless cases where people, often white people, come into the community and try to benefit from its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We’ve heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are not being heard and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already shaken hands with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism in relation to death row prisoners.
His involvement made the project appealing to Ferrell and six other locals who were watched for years by the crew of the film Whose Streets? after Brown was shot.
"In this documentary, no one is speaking for us or with us, we are speaking for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because that's how they portray me."
While the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience -- to show that the movement was not "the redeemer's direction, but the gathering of the community," as Folayan said -- he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, Whose Streets? documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the film.
“But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability.”
What’s more, Ferrell’s story emphasizes and refocuses the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who came up with the theme <0x23>BlackLivesMatter after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 are homosexual.
"In their leading roles, black homosexual women have sustained the movement in general," Ferrell said, " precisely because we have to constantly fight on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to carry all this burden.”
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed sustained by black women, and many of them are black homosexual women."
At the same time, he argues that “this isn’t some sort of a form of creating equal opportunities”—Ferrelli wasn’t chosen as the center of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who blew the right energy," he said.
"But it's no coincidence that she was right on the front line, because living as a black homosexual woman at such junctions is a lot at stake.
You can see his energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police remain fragile.
Ferrell's conditional sentence for blocking the road during the protest will last for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social-political atmosphere in the region he calls home, simply as a “massive booze.”
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra that he has etched into his memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
7 Ways to Get Rid of a Hangover After a Weekend Party
Some of the strongest male boys will find something that will help them after a nap-hazardous party.
Or, as the saying goes, “Avoid hangovers, stay drunk.”
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a healthy kid.
What can you do to feel better in the morning and get over the hangover as painlessly as possible after today’s and tomorrow’s Weekend party?
Drink some water.
Down and on alcohol, after a big party in the morning... or even in place of alcohol, if possible.
Since the body loses a lot of fluids when drinking alcohol, it has to be recovered somehow.
Minerals are washed out of the body along with water, which is why it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is especially good if the product is bubble-free or only slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
Surely it wouldn’t be worth going to Grandma’s with a hangover to smash trees – it could turn out to be a fatal misdeed.
A walk will help your body to remember what it feels like to be alive.
Laying down in a tent and sleeping out of a hangover is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give your body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you’re already vomiting from yesterday’s over-drinking, don’t try to load a large fat steak into your stomach.
Start with a fresh juice, for example, that contains fruit sugars to quietly energize your body.
If you are already suffering from health problems around lunchtime, you could try a broth, for example.
And then, a little later, backwards.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic releases your body from the last of the water.
As I said before, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take painkillers to prevent hangovers in the evening, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and will lose performance.
You will ruin your liver even more, and the hangovers will be worse in the future.
In addition, the painkiller does not stay in the body for very long anyway.
If you take painkillers in the morning, do not do it on an empty stomach - it will irritate your already gnawed stomach.
If you don’t have a partner, get along well with yourself.
It's like walking, but you can't have an orgasm when you're walking.
However, avoid excessively active tempo and crazy poses - during hangovers, physical exertion should be moderate.
You're kidding.
Talk to your friends and accomplices, do simple nonsense, and laugh kindly at yourself and others (suffering).
Jokes and laughter may not make the hangover go away, but they certainly make it more fun to endure the aftereffects.
Someday the hangover will go over anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee is being sought nationwide after a deadly stabbing male body was found in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to Cook County court documents, no bail warrants were issued on Monday for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after being repeatedly stabbed.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago police station to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police received a phone call and found a victim with multiple stab wounds on his body on arrival at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and investigators view stabbing as murder, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the University of Northwestern, said in an e-mail that Lathem had been temporarily suspended and was banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is working with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant in finance at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have been in contact with British police and are ready to help U.S. investigative agencies in any way we can.”
In addition, the statement said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, the head of the Chicago Police Department's communications department, urges suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are, but we're getting more and more involved in defining the exact location," Guglielmi said.
Guglielm said local, regional and national authorities were helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to police, it was a bad sight.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi said.
The management of the Grand Plaza sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working on the chronology of the events and the background of the victim, and are investigating various motives, including the possibility of a family dispute."
Start-ups to help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the polls were fruitless.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"This system just wasn't consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company that sells hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he invited outsiders to help.
New types of human resources start-ups are emerging to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software with the specific objective of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct instant surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hotline to file complaints, and in some cases allow language carriers to bypass C-level managers and turn directly to the board.
“Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City’s startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
According to Errett, in the three years he has been using Glint, he has gained a much better insight into what his employees think and feel.
In addition to sudden surveys and surveys targeted at specific teams, it provides a company heat map that gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the reasons.
Companies are beginning to understand that they need to keep up with their work culture so as not to become the next Uber that has been wrapped up in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing a harassing environment where those who dared to speak were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation, and compliance could be worth more than <0x24>118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let’s Talk Payments, a website for financial technology statistics.
Convercent, a Colorado-based start-up that helps businesses prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, noted an increase in interest and activity this year against the backdrop of Uber’s suspicious reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send custom impulse surveys, collect real-time confidential responses, and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And if the CEO is involved, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been seized by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to be mistreating its employees or behaving unethically, the company may face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee resignations, and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find the company headquarters phone number or email address, file a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and inconvenient process, Ruby Tuesday’s general counsel James Vitrano said, saying there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that a company uses Convercent, however, it is possible to identify and address problems such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage practices that did not hit managers who operated in other cities or state offices earlier.
"I have the opportunity to get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began taking ethical behavior, values and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it wasn’t until “social media matured” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their dirty laundry from washing publicly online.
"Before using technology to track ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies periodic fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent was <0x24>10 million funded by companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the capital raised to <0x24>47 million.
In November, Glinti invested <0x24>10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company’s total funding to <0x24>60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise, given the interrelationship between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that today’s employees expect more from the workplace than before.
Competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, have high salaries and interesting projects with mere stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy in the company, feel they are listened to, and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of the Department of General Benefit and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make a profit if the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well if employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder they’ll find support.
According to experts in the field of working culture, having data on employee involvement is important.
However, this data is useless if the company’s supervisors do nothing about it.
In fact, when a company asks its employees for feedback, it can create expectations that changes are coming.
And if changes don’t happen fast enough or not at all, it can lead to frustration and reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of the consulting and business management firm Kotter International, who has seen how companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
“Because if things don’t go to the end, the employees will think, ‘Did you really listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys of employees, has been able to implement measures on the same day the problem was reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from frustrated employees about the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to address the problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays collects new employee data and hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a longer-term commitment of employees in an industry known for its high workforce turnover.
"If you're not committed to ensuring transparency, you're losing people," Vitrano said.
“When you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses.”
The Baltics is a shining star in the euro area: incomes are growing rapidly
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, citing a report from the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, GDP per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Success is driven by low debt, fast-improving institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic countries, along with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita in purchasing power has significantly approached the EU average," the central bank said.
Although the goal is to bring the GDP per capita of the economy on par with the wealthier Western Europe, in 2015 the GDP per capita of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, the local population is not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of those surveyed thought this about the economies of their countries.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel twice-daily workouts makes Bruins’ days long
It’s almost 11 p.m. when a bunch of UCLA footballers stop to chat on the edge of the team’s new training ground on campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, revealing their sweaty back from the first day of their training camp effort.
For a large part of the team, these arrivers offer a midday break.
After a three-hour training session, players return to the dormitory for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6.30 a.m. the following morning.
"The next three days will be a real test for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel twice-daily exercises to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer—at least until they finish their final exams on Friday.
For this reason, the first three sessions of UCLA were scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already tight schedule of the players.
Transitioning from two workouts per day means more days with one workout - the start of Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season, and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons, training takes place during summer courses.
They have 18 training sessions scheduled for August 20 before the official preparations for the opening game against Texas A&M in September begin.
According to Mora, he is in favour of a change in the NCAA’s rules, although this adds another agenda item to the players’ tight schedules.
"They have a huge load in three or four days and it's a serious challenge," Mora said.
“And they will break through this trial; they will exert themselves; they will be fine young men.
I believe that when Saturday arrives and we have more time, it will be really nice.”
When the camp is over, UCLA will shut down its training sessions, which is not an easy task, given the clear view from the nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin centre, a superior hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have escaped the protective net around the gate post.
From this weekend onwards, the Bruins Hotel will be occupied by players, but Mora admitted that problems could arise with free rooms during the season.
"We're building security measures," Mora said.
“It’s a real concern and it’s not an exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and film a workout.
If you have a recording of a training session, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're using security there and in the eighth parking lot.
We do our best to use what we have.
I'm trying not to worry about that.
We have a plan in place.”
In revenge, the Savisaar-Ivanova electoral alliance born for the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland expelled from the Reform Party and Maria Kaljuste forced to leave the EKRE, created in connection with the unification of the forces of Our Tallinn and the hopeful businessmen’s electoral alliance Tegus Tallinn – it seems that at least the election alliance created on the initiative of those who have been burned in party politics will take part in the local elections as much as much this year.
However, the chicks will be considered in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who's staying with Savisaari?
How small Edgar Savisaar’s supporters have become can be guessed from the events organised in honour of his electoral alliance.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and present middle-party and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral alliance?
And can the reason why some of Savisaar’s loyal supporters and friends are evading the candidacy in Tallinn be found in the fact that the “Savisaar’s List” of the exploiters, which is headed by corrupters and suspects of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the city district government for a Russian-language pop song, in which the elder of the Lasnamäe district participates; and in every sense a rudimentary computer game in which the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, must avoid squirrels and squirrels on the road while riding - is this how the Centre Party catches the voices of 16- and 17-year-old voters who are allowed to the ballots for the ballots for the first time?
We look forward to seeing what other political parties have in mind about a youthful election campaign.
If, since the beginning of August, Channel 2 or TV3 viewers are faced with a black box instead of an entertainment programme, there are two options: to agree that in the future only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels will be available on the free-to-air market, or to hand over tens of them to a few TV operators each month.
There are probably also those who at first publicly welcome the ad-free TV experience, but at the end of the day, though reluctantly, pay for the TV picture and the ads.
Ear-locking music, noisy people and rubbish left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don’t want to be part of the noise yourself, instead of having a headache at home, it’s worth exploring your homeland – and leaving the bed to the festival guests for a hefty sum.
Washington to change green card rules
President Donald Trump said a new U.S. immigration plan was planned to change the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people a year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
"The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said in a statement.
Siberian Seto youth move to the city, pensioners return to the country.
Yevseyev Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners by the River Mana.
He works 140 kilometres from home as a chauffeur in a gold cartel on the side of the Mana River in Kuwait.
It’s a tough job: for two consecutive months with no rest days, 12 hours of work, and then only ten days at home and back again.
In the three years that he has worked at the Artel, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
“There’s a tough order: when you go in, you make sure you don’t bring any vodka, and when you go out, you don’t bring any gold,” Anatoly says.
Mare Piho is talking to Jaan, a local Seto in the village of Haida, who has told him a lot about his family’s memories in Siberia.
The still surviving archaic culture of the Siberian Setos will also affect the home setos, because it is just so fabulous, says Piho Mare, who has studied the distant Setos most thoroughly.
His first investigation into Siberia will take place 30 years ago this year.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many settlers still migrated to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to gain land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I'm saying 8,000.
I calculated it from the stories of the Siberian Seto men who have thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because up to 30 people could come in one group at the time, but the passport was only given to the man.
The passport was given only to one, but with him were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at how big this area was.
It was several times larger than the historic Setomaa.
It had to be managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (leaves), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Petser, many Setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (here Soviet power built a uranium enrichment plant - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the Seths make up the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, there was a long tradition of marrying each other and having many children.
Seven or eight children in the family were normal.
How different is the culture of the Siberian Setos and how different is it from the culture of the motherland?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folk costumes.
They made their own clothes, but they always made a difference between what was brought and what was made here.
Climate change has had a major impact on Seto traditional clothing, as it is colder here.
The food changed.
In Setomaa, for example, the meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the villages of the Siberian Setos and what kind of life do they live there? / Graphics: Alari Paluots
The connection with the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back there, it's going to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have heard amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida at the beginning of July for Seto Kingdom Day and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What's left here is fabulous.
"It is very easy to come and go to Tapa, because the city has a great location: at the railway junction and at the intersection of the roads," says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have plenty of nature, sports and culture, and there is a pizza on every corner.
It's a top-of-the-line city!
There is a small island by the river Valgej<0xC3><0xB5>gi, where the slaughterers usually hold a midsummer party.
"You can't see this beautiful place from the train window," says Reigo.
Anyone who is not afraid of cold water can swim in that river because the river is full of springs.
I’ve been swimming there and I can do it!
You can have a picnic on the bank of the river and just do the romance - you can look at the flow of the river and think about life in front and back.
I've been there walking with my girlfriends, too.
Tamm has been practicing his arias on the riverbank between three bridges: "Because this place is by the city, no one may come back to me when I mutter my own stories".
"The Männiku Hill offers a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and currently play disc golf - the golf course has been completed, discs can be rented from the sports centre," Reigo leads.
The old pros go there with their discs, of course, but I haven't gotten to play there yet.
My colleague Rasmus Kull must probably be invited to visit Tapa, because he is an experienced disc golfer and has discs.
I think he's borrowing me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood of the current opera isolist.
At least during the skiing hours.
There are many tears, disappointments and you can win in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"The whole city centre is currently full of construction work, all of which is going to be unrecognizable," says Reigo.
However, the old and tired station building of Tapa is a very attractive place where summer discoveries are played.
I am glad that in 2012 the head of R.A.A.A.M. Märt Meos accepted my idea and came to the summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year’s theatre season with Alexei Karenin has just ended, on August 11th there will be an Awakening of Life at the railway station, while the old railway station building is being moved around in the 1980s.
"From 11 to 13 August, the Tapa City Days will be held, during which home cafes have been opened in the station building and a series of cultural events will take place, including a public rally," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city in those days.
In a small yellow house on the 1st of May, the museum has been in existence since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and a lot of information," Reigo praises the place, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and military.
Reigo says that if you go through all the recommended places in Tapa, your stomach will soon be empty, but luckily the small town is full of cafes.
“We have such good places to eat, and sitting in cafes sometimes makes you feel like you’re abroad,” she describes.
The educated and young soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there gives a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and your hometown, but there is such an international community all around you.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we move a lot!
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Camping
The bTV channel quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying that two Bulgarians had been arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of illegally camped people in Sithonia, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is underway.
The foreign ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone who is caught taking a holiday in a place that is not intended for that purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Wolves that teach puppies go out to break sheep.
After a year-long break, farmers in Hiiumaa are forced to give the wolves "learning material" from their herd - wolves that have probably taught puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves have broken sheep three times in Hiiu County, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year the number was only three, a year earlier it was 124.
The data of the Environmental Agency are also synchronised with the breakdowns, that there were no wolves litters in Hiiumaa last year, and the information of the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that two wolves litters have been fixed on the island this year.
On Monday night, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste parish and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Early Wednesday morning, the wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheselja and severely injured another, who had to be killed in an emergency.
The rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent the Bill on Amendments to the Environmental Release of Genetically Modified Organisms Act (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the coordination circle.
With the amendment to the Act, the creation of a separate database for both the locations and handlers of genetically modified (GM) crops will be abandoned, for which the plant health register will be used in the future.
In addition, the obligation of a GM crop handler to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in apiculture within the prescribed radius will be amended.
Although genetically modified crops are not currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-genetically modified crops.
At least until it has been decided to declare Estonia GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, the head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors," Suu added.
The Bill repeals the provisions related to the database of the locations and handlers of GM crops and the training in handling in the GMOVS, and establishes the requirements for the handling of GM crops and the commencement of economic activities.
In the specific case of beekeeping, the current obligation of the GM crop grower to inform beekeepers of the start of the cultivation of the GM crop is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of the cultivation.
The Bill has been sent to the ministries for approval.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult it in the information system of the Bills and, if they wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will primarily affect persons active in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810 - is allowed to be grown.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no corn pest in Estonia, the European strawberry strain, against which the maize MON 810 is resistant.
Varieties of this corn line are also bred for the southern regions, and this corn is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs commissioned studies to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in the seeds of different varieties of summer oilseed rape, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
The analysis results of the samples showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign genes and the results of the study concluded that the seeds of rapeseed, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the foregoing, it can be concluded that genetically modified crops are not consciously grown in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu as "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited a “genius” in the form of Nemanja Maticu after his debut against midfielder Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The <0xC2><0xA3>40 million Chelsea-built player started in Dublin United’s last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday with a 2-1 win in the opening line, impressing in the defense role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on offensives.
However, having missed the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was desperately short of match form and only lasted 45 minutes, which Mourinho says must be corrected well before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has a football mindset," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get into shape as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the opening line at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho quietly set up his eleven starting men at the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three more footballers, but he confirmed that the club has already done a “great job” by signing contracts with three of his four priority choices.
“I am grateful to the club for having been able to make three out of four,” he added.
“I’m even happier if they can make four out of four, but they’ve worked hard for me.”
Another pedigree boy got a GSM transmitter on his leg on August 1 and this time in Muhu.
According to bird observer Mati Martinson, who lives in S<0xC3><0xB5>rve, the first stork chick was equipped with an escort in S<0xC3><0xB5>rve, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest site and has joined the large overnight population of Mullutu-Suurlahti.
This is because there are no grain fields in the S<0xC3><0xB5>rves, writes the Voice of the Islands.
This Tuesday, already relatively late for the ringing of cranes, another crane chick got attached to the escort, and this was on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project led by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a young crane named Mati was equipped with a GSM transmitter in S<0xC3><0xB5>rves Türjul.
“His activities are all visible on the internet: how he went to winter in Spain, when he came back for a long time he was stuck on the German-Polish border and then he came to Saaremaa,” Martinson said.
A British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into a house and car.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could simply open his front door, get into an office, and even start a car.
Steven Northam, 33, had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and index finger, and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant-anesthesiologist at Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company will also replace the locks on houses and cars to make them compatible with the chip, charging <0xC2><0xA3>300 for one lock.
This married father of one child has now installed the technology both at home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
White House Exhibit Costs Taxpayers Thousands
According to military documents released to TIME magazine, the White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter last month cost taxpayers as much as <0x24>24,000 for an event celebrating American production in the south yard.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One while the president was on board, was the central attraction of the event to introduce American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials on a tour of the United States’ industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was exhibited along with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House military cabinet requested the helicopter's presence with a partial command, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the south yard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said in an e-mail the day before the incident to his boss, a deputy chief of the Navy in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive in the southern courtyard on 17 July at 7 a.m. for the event starting at 3 p.m. and would stay there until the yard was cleared the same evening between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
It was added that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, the return flight would require a second flight due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the squadron's security crew remained close to the aircraft for the entire duration of its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents given to the magazine TIME whether a second quiz was eventually needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether the event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told not to," the commander wrote.
"You seem to have no choice," replied the senior officer's deputy.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
At the event, the President supported the efforts of the health care reform discussed in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to keep the government’s regulations under control.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political gain is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents need to use them for travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for photo sessions is unusual.
Trump was spotted in February when a presidential plane rolled into the background at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is swamped with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the presidential plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the 'American Made' exhibition, which featured products from all 50 states made by American workers made of American materials," White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often make test flights around Washington and in the south yard to practice landing at the White House with a centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 held 58 test landings in the White House yard.
According to the official, the flight to the event "made in America" was included in the flight crew's training flight standard for that month.
The squadron's helicopters flew for an additional 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, no other exhibit at this event burdened the taxpayer’s wallet.
According to a representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in organising an exhibition of the helicopter in the southern courtyard.
HMX-1 does not keep budget documents for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the event is difficult to determine.
But according to the Department of Defense’s 2017 hourly prices, the VH-3D compensation rate is <0x24>24,380 per flight hour.
In the squadron's documents, the flight was recorded as 30 minutes in both directions from the main base of the navy's Quantico airfield in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below this amount.
"Calculating taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated reimbursement rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, although they cover costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the helicopter at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud to be contributing to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So of course it is right to highlight it.”
It’s unclear whether or not Trump was in contact with a helicopter during a tour in the southern courtyard, but he did sit behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, making fun of the media about the company’s products in his personal aircraft fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
At the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, Shadeiko was hit in the last area, 800 metres of foot ramp and the stadium was taken away with a stretcher.
Shortly before that, he had reached zero in the long-distance jump at a university held in China.
At the 2012 European Championships in Helsinki, he was injured in the beaver throw, but at the London Olympics he was placed 23rd with 6013 points.
But the misfortune continued.
At the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, after the opening day, an Estonian woman who was on the Estonian record was injured in her thumb jump.
Two years later, he finished 15th at the World Championships in Beijing and met the Olympic standard, but this too had been a disappointment for the athlete.
It was not until last year that Shadeiko passed the hardest chadal, when he did not get the result in the distance jump at the European Championships in Amsterdam.
I'd just like to put together a decent multi-competition once in a while.
Once," Shadeiko confessed.
Worse still was ahead: a month later, his Olympic tournament in Rio was interrupted by a thigh injury at the first hurdle.
It’s time to take it down – do you want to continue with the seven races at all?
Are two days of hard work worth it?
She thought for a long time, but found peace.
I was able to think clean.
It’s pretty hard to describe this experience, but I’ve been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal and think about it.
"I knew I didn't put the pills in the bag yet," Shadeiko tells of her self-purification.
I was able to turn a clean page and move on with a new momentum.
According to coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to see the suffering of the person under care, but she realized that, above all, the athlete has to find out about himself.
He was so overwhelmed by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"But Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says Mägi.
Now he has some kind of peace.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when Shadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6,280 points in the Götzis multi-race.
In the high-level competition, he improved his personal top mark by nearly a metre (13.89) and ran a close-to-record hurdles race.
At that time, the multi-competitor felt that this was not a ceiling of abilities, but that it was only the first hunger for competition that had been extinguished.
Mägi, who has supervised him for years, says that Shadeiko is a pattern student.
He's an athlete, he's good to train.
If something is wrong or wrong, he will say it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his senses.
That's what we're supposed to do.
I cannot tell you exactly what to do and we will follow suit.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the kind of person who makes the most out of training," he says, saying that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Baby’s happiness makes you happy.
Shadeiko has also had good feelings for the happiness of her loved ones.
Both her former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-competitor has received support from new world citizens.
"It's been really interesting," says Shadeiko.
Drinking alcohol is equivalent to “training” the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the “very active” process of tasting wine.
By sniffing the glass, swirling the wine in the mouth, enjoying it, and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for the wine.
Wine molecules don’t actually contain taste, but taste comes from the way wine stimulates the brain.
It shows how the brain “sees” colors.
"Taste is not in wine, taste is created by the taster of wine," says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the formation of the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, warns us that wine isn't about getting drunk.
“There has to be more,” he says.
If you drink too much, the system is oversaturated.
Excessive wine drinking can harm the brain rather than benefit it, according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine risk memory loss, imbalance, and reduced mental capacity.
10% of Estonian ICT sector employees receive less than their colleagues
The data of the personnel search company Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less wages than their colleagues.
There is a 10% pay gap between men and women, according to Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in Fontes’ ICT sector wage survey.
A total of 8,577 posts were covered.
63% of positions were occupied by men.
"While only 3 companies found that the pay gap is in the favour of men and the rest companies think there is no pay gap, in reality, compared to similar jobs, men's monthly basic salary is on average 10% higher than that of women and men's annual total salary is on average 8% higher than that of women," said Ilmar P<0xC3><0xB5>hjala, an analyst at Fontese.
"Narcose" season 3 commercial clip: now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali cartel will take centre stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the fact that Pablo Escobar’s killer was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first one has already produced an advertising clip that teases the series with new villains.
In season three, the DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug organization, the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers "like a Fortune 500 company," simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages ties with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently released commercial, Pedro Pascal sees Javier Penana returning, a character who is recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will open on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only be held to represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
The head of the UN aid mission, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women are running in local council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Afghanistan's local council elections and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban, for their part, have threatened an electoral process that coincides with a transition period when the role of international military operations becomes consultative.
This year’s elections will mark the first time that power is peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women enhances the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything worse for both the big and the small.
There is always too little time together, but training with puppies is a good opportunity to combine being together, playing, closeness and load.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you're going in the summer, you'll always have the live hansies with you, and they'll impatiently remind you with their fine voice: "Let's do the exercise now!"
Start with a warm-up - it's very good to play a regular head game or skip along the beach strip.
Cucumbers are the foundation of keeping your legs and buttocks in shape – who would want to take the shape of a sand cake washed out of the waves during the summer?
It is wonderful to use children instead of sticks.
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the weight gradually increases at the same rate as the strength of the trainer.
Advanced students can also work with very large children.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions, and enjoys the opportunity to hang high and be important.
Larger children can also make their own pounds at the same time.
Determine the extent of movement by touching the ground and reaching out your hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-boy to hold them tight.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is a very useful exercise, but hopelessly boring for the child.
But it’s easy to make it more fun!
Game-plan: Take a long column of planks, which you can take turns running through.
In fact, it’s harder than usual, but much more fun to do if you can shake hands with a friend in the meantime.
To add the load, you can stay in the plank, on a small back, and also walk around in this position.
As an additional difficulty, you can make a smaller child sit on the hips, but this exercise will provide fun for all children.
While crabs gnaw on the sand, triceps, buttocks and abdominal muscles get a load like a snap.
The child descends on the legs so that the weight of his body is distributed equally in front and back.
You can hold hands for safety.
Bend your legs and stretch straight up.
You can fly, have fun, train for balance and be a challenge.
The life of a little coach is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
Extra weight is provided by stretching the legs forward.
Make sure your back is in a neutral position.
Children themselves have a lot more fun doing abdominal muscles in pairs and with a clap.
Handicraft and pulse squat.
Keep an eye on your child’s safety, knee position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
All children's favorite and great fun!
For parents, however, really effective whole body workout.

A trip from the Philippines to the heart of fashion lovers
Bags woven from straws are a summer classic, which has become a hit product in recent years, which one true souvenir enthusiast has to hang on his arm, and on which merchants, despite its modest origin, have been able to weld a price tag appropriate to the hit.
A straw-woven bag is probably one of those things that has existed in every person’s life and the possession of which has not caused any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it doesn’t, it’s not broken.
Now, however, the straw bags are making a real difference, and fashion fans have exchanged their fancy designer bags for simple straw-woven bags for the summer months.
Not only is it a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and the braver women even walk into the office with it.
In this case, however, it is worthwhile to first find out whether a summer look like this for the boss is still sitting or whether it is still worth pushing the wetter and laptop to a more formal sumada.
The variety of straw bags has made women a true summer lover.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing you notice is that on a holiday, fashion gourmets are the first thing to get to the local market and buy themselves some shoulder bags, which are then faithful throughout the holidays and which go along with the beach, the market and also hanging out with friends in the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so great that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go to each other with their hands to become the happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, this kind of madness is understandable, because it is rare that in the fashion world it is possible to buy something that has become a hit for just a few dozen euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple way to make money here, and so the finer luxury brands also sell straw bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably so that richer customers don't feel like mere mortals who prom around with cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a Dolce & Gabbana shoulder bag that costs over a thousand euros.
Chanel's interpretation of the shoulder bag, however, can be worth around 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashion designers, however, shoulder bags do not originate from some big fashionistas, but their story began much further away.
The straw bags are said to have originated far from the Philippines, from where they have spread to the wide world.
The braiding of straw bags is primarily an export business and locals are not seen walking around with them very often.
It is said that the straw-draining technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite similar to the usual basket-draining.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be woven as strongly as the basket, patterns and other materials can be woven into them, which make the bag more personal and more attractive.
For example, recently there have been particularly trendy bags with coloured ribbons or leather bands woven into them.
The letter of thanks can be sent primarily to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest braided shoulder bag fan ever seen.
He fitted his shoulder bag with all sorts of outfits and didn’t even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of bags nowadays does not play a minor role, but the fact that care for them is the head of a rooster, and unlike all other sumadans, they do not need to be maintained by special means, but water and a wet towel also take care of the matter.
As with trend shows, besides the classic look, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a rib cage woven from straw or a small shoulder bag.
However, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but on the shoulder bag it does.
What is the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag woven from straw has been considered classic, which resembles a basket in its style, is open from the top and has shorts on it, as well as straw, handles.

GMB worries about investment in McVitie’s Glasgow plant
The trade union expects the McVitie’s executives to confirm long-term production plans for the company’s Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent on the future of the Tollcross object investment.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
McVitie’s owner Pladis said they have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the property over the past few years.
Workers were hired there, and the union presidents “are the first to hear” if anything changes in the factory’s operations.
In a letter to the company’s site manager, GMB Scotland appealed to McVitie’s to “resolve concerns that the funding would not be used to modernize production lines.”
Drew Duffy, senior organizer at GMB, said: “The fact that we are not getting clarity from the site’s CEO about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plan is deeply worrying for our members.
Several generations of families have worked here and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people around Glasgow, an indispensable pillar for ensuring decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and a chronic decline in production, the eastern part of Glasgow desperately needs a company at McVitie with booming returns."
Pladis’s representative said: “Tollcross’s object manager just received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company responds directly to him because we value active interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting was held in Tollcross between employees and GMB representatives, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on a rolling basis - and this applies to all our companies and sites - to ensure that they are competitive.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross site, most of which has gone into production lines and operations improvement.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production site, and if there are any changes in the site’s operations, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about approaching Neymar?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in an effort to lure Neymar into his ranks, making an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record-breaking conquest?
This resounding approach has opened the summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current overbought world record set by Paul Pogba’s return to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, with over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week paid by PSG after payment.
Barcelona is known to be angry about both the approach and Neymar's break-up, although a source close to Catalans' board of directors confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the world of football about such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif severely warned all clubs that were thinking about recruiting some of PSG’s best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will confront them and contact them," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with one of our players, they have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could be relegated as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to strike a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: build bridges, not borders," he said.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and because it is not possible to do so, he would prefer to remain part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain’s exit smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We certainly could have such an agreement with Britain."
An alternative would be to return to customs posts that would declare historical division and political failure.
"Building trade, prosperity and peace," the Irish prime minister said.
He called Brexit “a challenge for our generation” and warned that the outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland’s daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main political parties in Northern Ireland during a visit to Belfast.
After his first half-long triathlon, Märt Avandi: Ironman can be passed by anyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in Otepää, the winter capital, when about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries entered the semi-long Ironman competition.
The distance of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life ended victoriously with Märt Avandi.
"I thought it was going to be difficult and it was going to be difficult in the end," said Avanti in the finish line.
Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that the triathlon is actually a workable head for everyone.
"It's not the distance that kills, it's the pace that kills," he said, implying that almost everyone will reach the finish line at the fastest possible pace.
Ott Sepp: “Ott’s physical body is fine, but unfortunately it can’t swim.”
Avanti has been working out since February.
First 4-5 hours a week, then 10 hours a week.
In time 05:34:12, he finished 270th overall.
Although Avandi lost to Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won against other competitors in the so-called "prominent class".
Last year, Tanel Padar, a "good example person", lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
The overall winner of the Ironman Otepää men’s competition was Johannes Moldan of Germany with a time of 3:58:27, Ivo Suur was the best Estonian with a time of 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Danish Helle Frederiksen won with a time of 04:24:01, while among the Estonians, Maria Jänesen lost to Frederiksen in half an hour and was given a time of 04:58:58.
The avant-garde swims a distance of 1.9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at 410th position.
