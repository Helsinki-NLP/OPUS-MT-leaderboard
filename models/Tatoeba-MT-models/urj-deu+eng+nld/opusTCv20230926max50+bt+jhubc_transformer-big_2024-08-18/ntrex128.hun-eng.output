Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will find themselves on the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly were shocked by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm arose after the National Assembly (Assembly) was called the Welsh Parliament.
Now MEPs from different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title might make them laugh.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that their new name would rhyme with “Twp” and “Pwp.”
Not for the sake of our Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means simple, and pwp means poop.
A representative of the Plaid party said the entire faction was "unhappy" and therefore suggested alternatives.
One Conservative MEP said his group was “open” to name change, but noted that the MWP was just a leap from “Muppet.”
Here it is worth noting that in Welsh the letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English "u" in Yorkshire, i.e. MWP pronounced "map".
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drafting the bill introducing the name change is as follows: “With regard to the titles for naming members of the National Assembly, the final decision is, of course, in the hands of the deputies.”
The Wales Government Act of 2017 allowed the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation proposing the inclusion of the Welsh Parliament, which received wide support.
Regarding the titles of Members, the Commission prefers the Welsh Parliament Member title and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation favoured the MWP alternative.
MEPs are coming up with more and more alternatives, but the agreement is rather cumbersome, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on name changes in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly in other areas, including the disqualification of members and committee structures.
Members will be able to cast their final vote on the issue of their own title in the course of the debate on the draft law.
Macedonia to hold referendum on changing country’s name
Citizens will vote on Sunday to change the country’s name to the “North Macedonian Republic”.
The aim of the referendum is to put an end to a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour is essentially a territorial claim and has repeatedly objected to its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the referendum on the name change and will not participate in it.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, claim that the name change is simply a compromise they have to make for their accession to the EU and NATO.
The Harlem churches are in a difficult situation, the bells of St. Martin have also been silenced
“In the past, as I hear from older people, there was a bar and a church around every corner,” Adams said.
“There’s no one anymore.”
As you say, the disappearance of the bars would be understandable.
“People are socializing differently these days,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the communal lounge where people go every day.”
As for the temples, Adams fears that the sale of church property will not fulfill the hopes of the leaders, “and they will eventually be back where they left off.”
And in the place of the churches, he adds, there will be residential buildings, the community of which will also not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy homes in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and this further hurries the permanent closure of churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these homes will join the community.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black city – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist church moved out of the church in the 1930s.
which was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin’s Church was taken over by a black church led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the Reverend is known for leading a boycott on Harlem’s shopping street, 125th Street, against his unwilling business owners.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation, the bell was built on the order of the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Reverend Johnson at St. Martin's Parish, proudly referred to the bell as "the bells of the poor."
According to the expert who played the bell in July, this bell is “a cultural heritage”, “an irreplaceable instrument of historical significance”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who joined the larger bell game at Riverside Temple 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin didn't hire anyone to replace him.
In St. Martin, in recent months, a complicated situation has developed with the participation of architects and contractors, who were involved in part by the secular leadership of the church and partly by the bishops’ office.
The parish’s governing body, the parish council, addressed the bishop’s office in writing in July, complaining that the office would “transfer the costs” to the council, even though the council did not participate in the selection of architects and contractors contracted by the office.
Some members of the community complain of a lack of transparency at the office.
A 13-year-old boy from California was attacked by a shark while fishing for cancer.
According to official reports, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and wounded by a shark while fishing for shrimp on Saturday, the opening day of the shrimp season in California.
The attack took place before 7:00 a.m. on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel, on KSWB-TV in San Diego, said that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he noticed a boy crying for help.
At first, Hammel thought that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a crab, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, “He bit me!
He bit me!
“His shoulders were torn at his collarbone,” Hammel told the story of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water,’” he added.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked the boy is not known.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told the press that sharks had already been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but that they were not considered to be dangerous for humans.
Captain Giles also said the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
For safety and security reasons, the coastline between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) was closed for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's expands to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's experts will compete with vendors and supermarket-style toiletries with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
As part of its <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion growth in the UK beauty market, the chain will test larger sized toilet stalls in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, they will be available in new stores from next year.
The strengthening of the toilet line is due to the fact that supermarkets are trying to replenish the shelf surfaces previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household items in various ways.
Sainsbury's said it is doubling its offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it is offering for the first time.
But the earlier brands, L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees, will also be located in a larger area at brand-specific booths such as Boots and similar stores.
The chain is also relaunching the Boutique makeup family, in which most of the products are now vegan – these are what more and more young customers are looking for nowadays.
Fragrance Shop is also testing its appearance at two Sainsbury’s stores, one of which opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while the other opens this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
With the spread of online shopping and the shift of food shopping habits to small local stores, supermarkets need to make greater efforts to lure shoppers into the market.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the supply will be more and more similar to retailers as the chain tries to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more and more services and products besides food.
Since the acquisition of the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury’s has opened hundreds of stores with Argos-classes and some Habitat-classes – a move that has had a positive impact on food sales, making the acquisition even more profitable.
The store chain’s previous attempts to apply wrinkles to beauty and medicine departments have failed.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the dispute over the distribution of the revenues of the drug departments in its stores ended it.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business of 281 stores to Celesio for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to the chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury skin care products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “By transforming the look of our toiletries, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
In addition, we have hired qualified staff to provide advice to those interested.
Our brand portfolio caters to every need, and the attractive environment and convenient access to the venue provide the attraction that takes the shopping experience to a new level.”
Peter Jones 'tombolt' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones has left in anger after television presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal for her lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the Truly brand of homewear and accessories.
The two celebrities’ ventures were previously compared to the Goop brand listed by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that he was quitting.
Holly Willoughby took the lead at Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones when she left their promising lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her own highly lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones is a “tom shop” when the TV salvage company announced in a tense meeting Tuesday at Jones’s business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to a total of <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million in new contracts, there was no time left to devote to their common brand of homewear and accessories, Truly.
The two celebrities’ ventures were previously compared to the Goop brand listed by Gwyneth Paltrow, and were expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from the island to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
It was supposed to be addressed in the long term, and it would provide a livelihood for the next few decades.
His departure was a complete surprise to everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close.
The Marlow office has a warehouse full of goods for sale."
Experts say the departure of This Morning’s host, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of dollars, thanks to massive investments in the range of pillows and candles, clothing and home wear, and possible slippage.
It could also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-year-old presenter and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby launched Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples usually go on vacation together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production office.
Willoughby will be the product face of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones commented last night: “We don’t want to comment on [Jones’] business.”
Tough words were spoken, “Then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might consider to be “unpresidential,” and for making such a positive statement about the North Korean leader.
“Why has Trump allowed so much?
He asked Trump in a funny “newsreader” voice.
“I didn’t allow anything.”
Kim would like to meet for a second time after Trump welcomed the first talks in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament, however, have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s Ri Jongho told the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that, as his country sees, there is no “appropriate response” from the United States to North Korea’s early disarmament efforts.
Instead, he said, the United States continues to maintain sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump said in a campaign speech that he was much more optimistic.
"Things are going great with North Korea," he said.
We were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a very good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – the completion of rocket tests, the release of the hostages and the return of the U.S. troops.
He also explained why he spoke in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
“Being president isn’t difficult, but right now there’s not a crowd of tens of thousands out there trying to get in, there’s only about two hundred of them standing in front of me,” Trump said, pointing to the group in front of him.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian tsunami and earthquake
After the earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia refused aid from international aid agencies.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to be deported, no national disasters were reported, which would be a precondition for international aid to arrive.
“In the past, in many cases, it has been stated very clearly that they do not need international assistance, so our situation is a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on a Paluba-based rescue team, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will be able to take part in the rescues on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Pau to see if international aid agencies are needed.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to face the destructive power of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, this is not common on other coasts.
Although a tsunami signal was in place, the apparent lack of a tsunami siren system in Palu also contributed to the catastrophe that claimed lives.
Even at the best of times, it can be difficult to travel between the Indonesian islands.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but it will be at least three days before it reaches the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has put the development of Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has not saved on costs in road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is now struggling with budget deficits ahead of next year’s elections.
In addition, the president faces ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as a result of riots in which Christian and Muslim gangs fell on each other in the streets with bush cutters, bows and arrows, and other crippled weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a huge equatorial goal against Chelsea
At Stamford Bridge, London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the 89th minute of the Premier League match.
His team lost 0–1 when Sturridge received a shot from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea gate.
First he put the ball to the left, then he started a huge kick into the far corner of the goal.
The shot went high over the sixteen, and it flew towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ended up in the net above the falling Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to get in position because there’s always someone like Shaq who plays the ball forward, so I tried to get myself in position as much as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I just took him off, and then I didn’t think much and I shot him.”
Chelsea drove 1–0 in the half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored the lead in the 25th minute.
With the blues on the corner, Mateo passed the ball to Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>, then managed to break off in the midfield and rush into the Liverpool half of the field.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> took off after a quick shot and got the ball back in the midfield.
He then launched Hazard with a beautiful handover to the sixteen.
Hazard ran the defense and eventually sent the ball into the far corner with a left shot at the Liverpool goal next to Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will meet Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples as the next stop of the Champions League group matches.
Chelsea will play against Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europa League.
832 people have been killed in Indonesian tsunami
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the local disaster management agency said on Sunday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake and the 6-metre-high tsunami that followed on Friday caused several people to be buried in the ruins, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The streets of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, are covered with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in the case of a stabbed woman
Police opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman’s body was found in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m., and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking people in the area to report anything they've seen or have died.
Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I would like to ask anyone in Birkenhead near John Street who has seen or heard anything to contact us.
In addition, I would ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything with an on-board camera, to contact us, because they may have information relevant to the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman killed was a Birkenhead resident and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, her friends came to the scene to find out where the body was found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police informed him that no one could enter the building and no one could leave it.
When he found out what had happened, the man could not speak.
Residents of the building have now been informed that it may take several hours before they can re-enter the building.
One of the police officers told someone that the whole building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman struggled with her tears.
"That's terrible," he repeated.
At 2 p.m., two police minibuses were inside the cordon and another one outside the cordon.
Within the cordon, several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone with any information should write a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact the Crimestoppers organization on the anonymous phone number 0800 555 111 and refer to the September 30, 247 file.
Parliamentary Cromwell statue is the latest victim of history rewriting fever
The exile of the statue could perhaps be a poetic justice for Cromwell and his fanatical Puritan followers, who at the time ravaged the cultural and ecclesiastical heritage of England with the enthusiasm of the Taliban.
However, according to the Cromwell Society, Crick's proposal is "foolishness," an "experiment to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of Westminster Palace would eventually become a target in the current debate on the removal of the statues.
During the English Civil War, the image destruction was not ordered and executed by Cromwell.
So maybe another Cromwell will fall victim to his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning Cromwell portrayal reflects the views of the 19th century and commemorates a historical figure that many still believe should be celebrated today.”
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is now perhaps less popular than he was at the end of the 19th century, yet many consider him a defender of parliament against external pressure, which in his case, of course, was monarchy.
Whether this picture is really accurate remains the subject of a historical debate.
What is certain, however, is that this strife that broke out in the middle of the 17th century influenced the further fate of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as a Lord Protector deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
A Chinese farmer was wounded to death by a pig.
Local media reported that a pig attacked and wounded a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
His last name was a man identified as Yuan, who was found with a ruptured artery, covered in blood, next to a pig farm in the Liupanshui market in the province of Kuichou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is about to vaccinate pigs in a farm in Xining, China, on May 30, 2005.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found the man’s corpse and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig farm was open.
According to him, the mouth of the giant hog in the pig farm was bloody.
According to the report, the expert investigation revealed that the 250-pound pig actually bit the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and they were smashed,” said a relative named Wu in Guiyang Evening News’ last name.
According to security footage, Yuan entered the pig herd at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that he could no longer harm others while police were investigating the traces on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are currently discussing compensation for the man's death.
Although not often, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales had squeezed a farmer onto his tractor until his wife managed to scare him off.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are generally not susceptible to attack, but can become aggressive due to the taste of blood.
“They are very playful.
Like little children, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them respect,” he said.
Severe rainfall following Hurricane Rosa in Southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it rises above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will continue to cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
Rosa struck at 140 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. East Coast time on Sunday, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone is formed over the Pacific Ocean and headed westwards towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, a tropical storm is flooding the southwestern United States with heavy tropical mist.
The storm on Monday can bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in some areas of Mexico.
Then the approaching tropical fog meeting the low-pressure masses will cause heavy rainfall in the coming days in the southwest.
Here, 3–10 cm of rainfall can cause sudden floods, debris-filled floods, and landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical fog can cause rainfall of between 5 and 8 cm per hour, especially in the southern regions of Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the Southwest, rainfall is expected from 5–10 cm, mainly in Arizona.
Sudden floods can also occur, with rapidly decreasing intensity due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
Especially during tropical rains, it is not recommended to start walking in the desert.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by sudden winds and dust clouds.
The approaching low-pressure masses can cause heavy rainfall on the coast of Southern California.
Rainfall of up to 1.5 cm is possible, which can cause minor floods full of debris and smooth road conditions.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Spontaneous tropical showers can occur in Arizona as early as Sunday evening and Monday morning, followed by rainfall in broader areas on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall spreads into the Four Corners region on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States as the Arctic air masses cool, but the tropical ones remain quite warm.
This can cause drastic temperature differences even over short distances.
An excellent example of this is the situation in the central region of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is about 10 degrees.
In the coming days, it is expected that the summer heat will be felt again in larger areas.
The central and eastern areas of the United States are expected to be warm in the first half of October, with temperatures ranging from the southern part of the Great Plain to parts of the Northwest around 25 to 30 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York City will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term weather forecasts predict that temperatures in the eastern United States will likely exceed average temperatures until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition
On six television channels, more than 20 million viewers followed the testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, a high-ranking judge, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of rape in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate remained unresolved, and broadcasters were forced to interrupt the regular broadcast due to a last-minute Friday twist: Arizona senator Jeff Flake managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been touching him at a high school party and trying to undress him.
In Kavanaugh’s passionate testimony, he said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
The testimonies were likely seen by more than 20.4 million viewers on Friday, according to Nielsen.
Nielsen calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other channels that mediated the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen finds it difficult to measure the number of people watching shows at work.
For comparison, there are so many spectators of the football finals or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, of all channels, the Fox News Channel, which hosted experts supporting Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest viewing rate, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day’s audition.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS received 3.1, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million views, according to Nielsen.
Interest did not decrease after the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of the moderate Republican senator issued a statement that the senator would vote for Kavanaugh, he was shown on CNN and CBS on Friday morning as a loud crowd of protesters took him to a meeting of the Judicial Affairs Committee on the elevator.
For minutes, he was spotted as the crowd scolded him, and CNN aired the scene live.
"Here I am," a woman told the senator.
“Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth in public?”
Others yelled at him, “You have the power to do what so many women don’t.”
Flake only said that his office had issued a statement, and then, before the elevator door closed, he added that he would share what he had to say at the hearing.
It was shown live on cable and broadcast channels hours later as the committee voted on whether Kavanaugh's candidacy should be submitted to the full Senate for a vote.
Flake, however, said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, as advocated by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake was convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made up his mind following conversations with Coons and later with other senators.
Flake's decision was used properly, as it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit opponents of political play
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of jeopardizing the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will be attending a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview appearing directly next to May’s interview, May’s former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacks May’s so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the suggestion of Britain and the EU managing each other’s tariffs is “absolutely absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in a shooting involving the death of 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested on charges of murder, Baton Rouge said.
Police have released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and announced that Sims’ glasses fell off during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene, and Simpson's DNA was on the CBS network's WAFB channel.
After questioning Simpson, police announced that the young man had admitted that he had shot Sims.
According to the lawyer’s report, the court set the bail at <0x24>350,000.
According to a preliminary report released Friday by the East Baton Rouge County coroner, the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The office thanked the Louisiana State Police Task Force on Escape Criminals, the state police forensics lab, the university police, and local residents for their help in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU’s athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the competent law enforcement forces for their “committed and persistent efforts to find out the truth.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter-tall attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also an LSU basketball player.
The Sims scored a rebound average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game in the final season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the news of Sims’ death “devastated” and “shocked” the team.
“You’re always afraid that something like that will happen,” Wade said.
Volcano floods Mexico City with ashes
The ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
After an intensification of volcanic activity in the crater and 183 gas and ash discharges in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center also observed several rumblings and tremors.
The images shown on social media sites in some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, show a thin layer of ash on the windscreens of cars.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the Mexican capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on anniversary of independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with the police, and thousands joined rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s divisive disengagement referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the storm police who were holding them back, so the streets that were once crowded with tourists were now covered with dense powder paint.
Later in the day, further fighting broke out, during which the police tried to maintain order with batons.
The pro-independence factions chanting the slogan "We will not forget, we will not forgive" and the pro-unity demonstrators lining up behind the slogan "Long live Spain" stood against each other for hours.
Local media reported that 14 people were injured during the protests.
Tensions in the region, swamped with independence aspirations, have not diminished as a result of the October 1 referendum declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
A huge majority of voters voted for the secession, although the turnout was rather low as the majority of Unionists boycotted the vote.
The Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations by means of actions leading to aggressive clashes.
Pro-independence groups were on the streets all night on Friday to stop a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it could not be prevented, the demonstration eventually did not follow the normal route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said there was no longer any chance of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I have seen my parents tears of joy in voting for us, but by now our case has been laid to the ground,” he said.
Although the regional elections last December saw an important, if limited, victory, it is difficult for Catalan independence parties to maintain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders have voluntarily gone into exile or are awaiting arrest by the court for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who recorded the protest with his phone, said the conflict was being fired by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he says.
Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras, who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“The best way to reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government represents is to stand as a candidate in the European elections,” he said.

Menga scores 1–0 for the Livingston Rangers
Dolly Menga's First Goal Secures Livingston's Victory
Livingston's fresh entry into the first division was a big surprise for the Rangers team by getting his second defeat to Steven Gerrard, who has been coaching the Ibrox club for 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference, as Gary Holt's team was in second place against the Hibernian team.
The Gerrards have remained unsuccessful in the current season of the Scottish League and face the first-placed Hearts team next Sunday, with eight points behind.
However, the Rangers still have a game ahead of them on Thursday against Rapid Wien in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston has increased its divisional defeat series to six victories, which means that Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, hasn't beaten the team yet.
Livingston has missed a lot of situations against the inaccurately playing guest team
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before the only goal of the match, as their attacking game caused the Rangers not much trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through the opponent's defense, but dragged the attack too far, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt proved wide after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-headed ball before the goal line.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play their own game, as they were confident that they would be able to distract the guests in fixed play situations.
The fateful goal was born precisely from such a situation.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a gap in defense, creating a situation for Menga, who took advantage of it from the mid-sixteenth.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers led in possession of the ball, but the home defense remained impenetrable, and Liam Kelly's gate was barely compromised.
This trend continued in the second half of the match, except for one situation where Kelly had to defend against Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defeated by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow missed another free kick at Livingston.
Two penalty points were not scored by the attacking team: one was Halkett's entry against Glenn Middleton, who was a substitute, and the other due to handshake.
"Phenomenal" game from Livingston - match analysis
Tony Macaroni from the Arena reports Alasdair Lamont, a BBC Scotland correspondent
Livingston performed phenomenally and won the prize.
All of the players performed well and exceeded expectations.
The team’s members and playing style have barely changed since they returned to the top, but Holt’s efforts also deserve serious recognition, as the coach has sped up the team since his arrival.
Several players have taken their best form.
Captain Halkett made a huge contribution to his well-organized defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall well-steamed.
The Rangers played without any idea.
No matter how well they sometimes perform under Gerrard's leadership, they were now unable to bring that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – they only managed to break the home defense once anyway – so the Rangers have to get together quickly as they slip back to the center of the field.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
The morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin on Saturday (29 September) was characterized by a pleasant atmosphere and a good mood.
This was the last day of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s divisive visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO members.
Relations between the two countries have deteriorated due to issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s membership of the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then travelled to Cologne to celebrate the opening of a huge mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside of Turkey.
The police banned the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but several supporters of the president appeared to see the Turkish head of state.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, including several Kurds, also expressed disapproval of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome the head of state.
The two opposing demonstrations illustrate the divisive nature of the president’s politics, which some German citizens of Turkish descent celebrate as a hero, while others see him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: a bicycle car collided and killed
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The crash took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a high-traffic road in Deptford in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics tried to help the bike, but he died on the spot.
The crash occurred just a few months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
London police said police were still working to identify the man so they could alert his family.
Due to the investigation, roadblocks and bus diversions make it difficult to transport, and the authorities advise drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Wounded in Riot
Six prison guards were injured in riots in a highly guarded man’s prison, the prison’s administration said.
The riots began at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday at Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire, and have not yet been contained.
In order to deal with the situation, a special force called "Tornado" was deployed to the scene. Eight inmates were detained in a building wing.
The members of the special forces suffered only minor head injuries, which were treated on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison organization said: “A specially trained prison guard team is handling the situation at Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the team had to be treated for an injury.
We will not tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and they will face further prison sentences."
The Long Lartin Men's Prison detains more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison director was reportedly hospitalized after being attacked by one of the inmates.
In October last year, the Special Forces were also needed to defeat a serious riot in which inmates attacked prison staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (the situation in drought-stricken areas could improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depression, but that’s exactly what the state expects to expect early next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa sweep through the desert southwest, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as the southeastern areas of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to pass through the city of Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night with heavy rains.
The Phoenix Meteorological Service tweeted: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix in the form of tropical storms or depression.
For example, Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached the border of AZ for 40 miles.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50-100 mm of precipitation, which in extreme cases, such as in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona, can reach up to 150 mm.
In other parts of the southwestern desert areas (central areas of the Rocky Mountains, Great Basin, etc.) precipitation can be expected from 25 to 50 mm, but in some places it can rain up to 100 mm.
The rain brought by Rosa may bring relief to areas not threatened by lightning, as the region is currently suffering from severe drought.
Despite the fact that floods are a serious threat, some of the rainfall can have a beneficial effect on the drought-fighting southwestern regions.
“The U.S. drought watchdog said more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is affected by a minimum of extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category,” the report said.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
It will continue to be hurricane-powered, and on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 137 km/h, it will pass about 600 km south of Mexico’s Punta Eugenia and will head north at about 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder currents in the Pacific Ocean and will lose its strength.
Mexico is expected to be hit by a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or in the evening.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rainfall is expected, which significantly increases the chances of flooding.
“Regents can produce an average of between 70 and 150 mm of rainfall from Lower California to the northwestern part of Sonora, where it can rain up to 250 mm in some places,” weather.com said in a report.
Rosa then travels northwards through Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the border of Arizona in the early hours of the morning on Tuesday, in the form of a tropical depression, to sweep through Arizona on Tuesday night to reach southern Utah.
“The biggest threat from Rosa and its remains will be expected to be extreme rainfall in Lower California, Northwestern Sonora, and in the desert areas of the southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening thunderstorms and sludge flows in desert areas, and landslides in mountainous areas should be feared.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
At 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday, an injured teenage boy was found in Norton Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer.
The boy was immediately taken to the hospital, and his condition was “stable”.
Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man had been arrested in Radstock, Avon and Somerset during the night.
The authorities are asking the public to contact anyone who has a cell phone recording of the incident.
Trump said Kavanaugh had to suffer the Democratic Party’s “bad feelings and anger.”
"Whoever votes for Judge Kavanaugh will vote against the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, Kavanaugh suffered the Democratic Party’s “bad feelings and anger” during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he resolutely and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he had committed sexual assault decades earlier as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford also testified and stood up to his earlier claims.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans could see with their own eyes” Kavanaugh’s “brilliant and fearless character.”
“The votes cast alongside Judge Kavanaugh are those cast alongside one of the finest legal professionals of our time who has a flawless civil service record,” Trump told supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred to Kavanaugh’s candidacy while talking about the importance of Republican voters’ participation in the mid-term elections.
“Only five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not going to go, but I’m going to go,” he said.
“I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats followed the tactic of “resistance and impediment.”
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place by Friday, a senior Republican adviser told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian tsunami, death toll rises
Many people were swept away by the tide, and at least 384 people were killed when huge waves hit the coast. The disaster was caused by a powerful earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when the nearly six meters (18 feet) high waves reached the shore at dusk, sweeping away many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach longer, did not flee immediately, so they became victims of the waves,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t just come on its own, it drove cars, logs, houses and everything else off the coast,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled at a speed of 800 km/h on the open sea before reaching the coast.
There were those who climbed to the tops of trees from the stream and escaped, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters please.
The aerial photographs released by the agency show many destroyed buildings and commercial premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further aftershocks shook the coastal town.
Earthquakes could be detected in an area of about 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said Friday's earthquake released 200 times more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, and the resulting geographical conditions may have reinforced the impact of the tsunami.
According to Nugroho, the damage was “significant”, with thousands of homes destroyed and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured so far has been 540, and another 29 are being sought.
According to Nugroho, on the coast 300 kilometers (190 miles) from Palu, in the area called Donggala, the number of injured and the damage caused could be even greater as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication is "completely paralyzed, there is no information available" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, stating that its staff and volunteers were already on their way to the disaster-stricken area.
"The situation is already tragic, but it could be even worse," he added.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday for not informing the public about the tsunami that hit Palu, but the management said the waves had already reached the shore when the alert was issued.
An amateur footage shared on social media shows a man from the upper floor of a building crying desperately to warn those on the street of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a huge wall of water hits the shore, rolling cars and buildings with it.
The Reuters news agency has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage, making it impossible to communicate around Palu, making it harder for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The army sent relief cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but authorities say the evacuated population will continue to need food and other essential supplies.
The city’s airport was opened only to facilitate relief work, and will be closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Pal evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to the town of Palu, where the employees found shelter under the tent covers set up in the office yard, but encountered signs of terrible destruction along the way, Doseba said.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he added.
“The situation is very bad.”
While the relief teams began to prepare for disaster relief work, some complained that foreign experts with extensive experience in this field could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, all aid, relief and personnel from overseas can only be allowed to enter the country if the place of the disaster is declared a disaster-stricken area at the national level.
That hasn't happened so far.
“The incident continues to be treated as a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government acknowledges that this is indeed a national disaster, we can allow international emergency services to enter, but no notification has yet been made.”
On the second night after Friday's quake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing continued to hope that their loved ones would be among those whose miraculous escape would smuggle some light into the dark atmosphere of reports of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the canal during the rescue work.
On Sunday, the workers managed to rescue a woman who spent two days under the ruins of her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, prepared two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month, this time in Indonesia.
In addition to the missing, other students were also trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a veteran paraglider, what happened puts a huge emotional burden on me,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among paragliders, for hours he was desperately trying to reach the contestants who were attending the beach festival on WhatsApp.
In addition to the messages, however, instead of two blue pipes, only one grey pipe appeared.
"I think that means that the messages could no longer be delivered," he said.
<0x24>26,750 stolen while charging an ATM at Newport on the Levee shopping mall
On Friday morning, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink’s employee who was loading an ATM with cash at the Newport on the Levee shopping mall, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the money truck had just emptied an ATM at the entertainment center and was preparing to fill it with more banknotes, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
A man approached Brink’s employee “from behind” while he was busy with his work and stole one of the prepared money bags.
Witnesses have seen several suspected perpetrators flee the scene, but the exact number of suspects is not included in the police statement.
Anyone who would like to provide information on the identity of the perpetrators can contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper's name changed to Yere
Kanye West, the rapper's name is now Ye.
The change was announced on Saturday on Twitter with the following message: “The creature formerly called Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and that was the title of his eighth album released in June.
He announced the name change before Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
Ariana Grande, who canceled due to "emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
The new name is not only an abbreviation of the rapper’s current artist name, but, according to his earlier revelations, it also has religious significance for West.
“I know that ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier when talking to radio host Big Boy about the title of his album.
So I'm you and I'm us and we're all one.
Kanye means the only, and that's what became Ye, which symbolizes the good, the bad, the confusion, everything in us.
The album reflects who we really are.”
Ye is one of those famous rappers who like to change their names.
Sean Combs has previously been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but this year he has announced that he will prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-creator, Jay-Z, also varied several times, with the question of whether his name should be written in one, in hyphens, or in capital letters.
Mexican president vowed not to use army against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged that he will never deploy military forces against civilians on the occasion of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the massacre of student protests.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square promised that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces opened fire on participants of a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people when leftist student movements showed signs of intensification in Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised to help Mexican youth by providing students with monthly financial benefits and plans to establish additional free state universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are the two main factors that drive young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI solutions
As China becomes more active in research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its support for such research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and user of artificial intelligence solutions that previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this after the U.S. government made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced plans to become the world’s number one AI developer by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly behind the US and the next breakthrough in the field of AI is imminent,” Lee said.
Doubling research funding could also double the chances of the United States taking the next big step in artificial intelligence, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures. The company has invested in one of China’s most significant AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that succeeded in defeating the best American Othello player, and later served as a board member of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged the achievements of technology competitions previously announced by the U.S. government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next such event would take place, as this would be an opportunity to find new future makers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get the public support they need for their research, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is stealing the scientific leaders, it’s the big corporations,” he added.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have contracted several major university skulls to work in the field of AI.
Lee said that changing immigration policies could also help the U.S.’s efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically get a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the China State Council announced its plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation provides support to academic staff in a similar way as the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and other governmental organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, an AI center where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested <0x24>2 billion in an initiative called AI Next,
The NSF is currently spending <0x24>100 million a year to support AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which planned to set up a national security AI committee, has not taken further action on the matter for months.
Macedonia to hold referendum on changing country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country’s name to the “Northern Macedonian Republic”, a move that would resolve a decades-long disagreement with Greece that prevented the country from accepting its application for membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces of which is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it is claiming the Greek territory of the same name, and has thus so far vetoed the country's NATO and EU membership.
The two governments agreed on a new name for the state in June, but nationalist opponents say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the mostly Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became doubtful whether the required 50% turnout for a valid referendum would be achieved.
The question on the ballot papers is: “Will the country support NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev at the forefront, argue that this price is worth paying in order to give Macedonia, as one of the countries that have risen to the ruins of Yugoslavia, a chance to join the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79).
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have declared that they feel bound by the result of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
According to the State Electoral Committee, no irregularities were reported until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the turnout so far only reached 16%, which was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (finally 66% of registered voters).
“I came to vote for my children because we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who gave his vote in Skopje, the capital.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted to change their name in Strumica in a referendum on 30 September 2018 that would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skopje, in front of the parliament building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage, as well as chairs and tents for those boycotting the referendum.
“We also support the country’s membership in NATO and the EU, but we would like to join with a proud, raised head, and not through the maid’s door,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they don’t want us to be accepted as Macedonia, then we can turn to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could be seen as an investment in Macedonia that a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20% is in great need.
"I think the majority will support our cause, as more than 80% of the country's population is fundamentally in favour of EU and NATO membership," Zaev said after his vote.
He also added that a “yes” vote means “providing the future of the country.”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Science, 30-43% of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to a survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, the turnout is expected to be 57% on Sunday.
Seventy percent of those who want to go to the polls said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be valid, the turnout must be at least one vote more than 50%.
The annulment of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government that came to power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero scores a goal in full Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have dealt roughly with Brighton's defense, winning Manchester City 2–0 at the Etihad Stadium in England on Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the midfield as the first step of the attack, and
He escaped between the three Brighton defenders to the open field.
Then four green jerseys surrounded Aguero.
He tricked one of the defenders, then ran down several times as he approached the Brighton Sixteen.
Then it went to the left for Sterling.
The English striker gave the ball back to Aguero, who finished the action with his right foot, hitting the right side of the gate of Brighton's net guard, Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero has a problem with his legs," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he could play for 55, 60 minutes at most.
And so it happened.
Luckily he scored just then.”
Sterling's action gave the Blues an initial advantage in the English championship match.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute, when
Aguero on the Brighton side of the field got a great pass.
He launched a beautiful crossball towards Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane played with the ball for a while before starting the long sterling.
The Blues were only able to swipe the ball into the goal before sliding out of the base line.
City will play with Hoffenheim in the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12:55.
Scherzer wants to make things harder for the Rockies
As the Nationals team missed the chance to get into the afterseason, they had no reason to really make an effort.
The ever-competitive Scherzer can’t wait to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opposing team still has a chance in the playoffs. The Rockies have a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Baseball League.
The Rockies secured at least one comforting spot with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title is still awaiting them.
“Despite the fact that we no longer have a chance, we can stand up to them in a way that the mood of the audience and the other team in Denver is expected to be at its peak for the whole year.
Of course I'm in the mood to get on track!"
The Nationals still have to pick the starting player for Sunday, but it is reported that Scherzer will be the pitcher in this situation.
For Scherzer, who took part in a pitch training on Thursday, this will be his 34th starting throw on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-handed Washington player stands this season with 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3 of the game.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The president also referred covertly to the situation around the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter participation in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far is at stake in November.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the big ones, one of the big ones – I’m not running personally, but I’m basically running, so I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “Everyone can see what these dreadful, radical Democrat groups are doing, they can see it with their own eyes.
They are truly determined and able to use any means to regain power, there is malice and depravity.
No matter who they hurt, no matter who they trample on, so that they can have control, they can have power. That's what they want, control and power, but we don't give up."
According to the president, the Democrats are using “resistance and impediment.”
“You’ve seen all this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angrily and maliciously and vilely and lying.”
He mentioned Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to whose ears he expressed outrage at the gathering.
“Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait – all this with very bad body language, it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer in favour of diversity.
They don’t tolerate people who are free to say what they think.
I was not at all surprised when the activists of Momentum in my own party decided to censor me.
After all, I am only the last in a long line of Labour MPs to be told that they are not welcome, simply because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment for his unwavering stance against anti-Semitism.
In my case, what the censorship didn't like was that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are ironically the very issues on which Jeremy also disagreed with the previous leaders.
The invitation to the workers’ party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said they wanted a “inclusive and productive meeting”.
For most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party, these Friday evening meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today, however, the tone has changed, and the promise of a “more restrained, polite” policy has been forgotten, if at all.
It is increasingly apparent that the Labour Party does not tolerate dissenting views, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and my colleagues, with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, have lately increasingly expected me to turn my back on my individual opinion and take a stand for things that I would otherwise never agree with, be it national security issues or the single European market.
After all my public speeches, no matter what I actually said, they start blaspheming on social media, demanding my replacement, criticizing the centralist policy, and telling me that I shouldn’t even be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues, as the comments addressed to me are usually confined to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues, who are forced to stand up to sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but do not run away.
The most disappointing aspect of today’s politics is that attacks at this level have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have given up on diversity, and with every motion of “infidelity” and every amendment to the electoral rules, the circle of those tolerated in the party is becoming narrower.
Over the past few years, many have advised me not to be so outspoken, and then “everything will be fine.”
That is not why I went into politics.
Thirty-two years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student because I was outraged that the Thatcher government had neglected schools so much that our classrooms almost collapsed, and then I fought for better public care for those in need, both as local councillors and as government ministers.
I have never concealed my political views, nor have I done otherwise in the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was quite clear to everyone what my political positions were, and on which issues I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will not only harm families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why so much time and effort has to be devoted to questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not to the members of the Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that any threat of substitution or political ends will not deter me from acting in my own judgment and in the interests of all.

Ayr–Melrose 38–17: Ayr uncompromising to the top
Two late attempts have slightly altered the final result, but there is no doubt about Ayr’s well-deserved victory in the day’s most entertaining game, the Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only one of the ten teams to be unbeaten.
Thanks to their unrivalled defense and superior use of position, they won, so the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
"We've had a lot of challenges in our games so far, but we're still undefeated, so I have every reason to be happy," he said.
Melrose player Robyn Christie said: “We have to admit that Ayr has made better use of his situation than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, which Frazier Climo scored a point, gave Ayr a head start, and thanks to a yellow card from the Warriors to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, Melrose could have made the difference, but Jason Baggot's attempt did not make a point.
Climo sweated Ayr's defense with a penalty, just in the half, and then scored a point from a one-man attempt, so the first half ended with a 17-5 result in Ayr's favor.
Melrose started strong in the second half, Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Baggo, reducing the team's drawback to five points.
Ruaridh Knott was severely injured and had to be taken off the pitch, and Ayr continued to increase his advantage with Stafford McDowall's attempt to reap the rewards of Climo.
Blair Macpherson, the captain of Ayr, also received a yellow card, and Melrose succeeded in blocking Bruce Colvine's attempt in the human race, thus breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started to catch up again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for dismantling Climo without a ball, MacPherson showed a touch down from the penalty line behind Ayr's attacking team.
Climo was selling, which he repeated almost immediately after the restart, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry forward for the homeowners' fifth attempt.
The protagonist of Still Game has started a new career in the hospitality industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be moving towards the hospitality industry, revealing that he has been placed at the head of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular television series, which he co-wrote and co-starred with his old comedian Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the next nine will be the final season, and it seems Kiernan is already planning a post-Craiglang life.
According to the official records, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to profit from Glasgow’s “blooming hospitality industry.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, with no coastline, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz, decorated with sails.
There are ocean blue flags on the public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon proclaim the motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to retrieve it."
Bolivia, which has no coastline, still has vivid memories of the lost coastline, captured by Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the nineteenth century, and a strong desire to rewind the waves of the Pacific.
These hopes have probably come to the fore for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the October 1 ruling of the International Court of Justice, which will conclude five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the ball that fills people with the spirit of unity and peace that await the outcome in a positive mood,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are watching the decision of the International Court of Justice on screen, hoping that the Hague Court will stand by Bolivia, and after decades of rapsodic attitudes, Chile will be obliged to sit at the negotiating table in order to give Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic, indigenous president, who faces a controversial fight for a re-election next year, could lose a lot with Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court will probably not rule in Bolivia’s favor, and that it would not change much if its ruling were to be favorable to Bolivia.
The United Nations body, which is based in the Netherlands, has no authority to judge Chilean territories and has also pre-determined that it will not affect the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice came just six months after the closing speeches indicated that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Moreover, the past four years have not only not helped the Bolivian case, but have even thrown it back.
“The issue of the sea exit has been diverted by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Because of Morales’ hostile rhetoric, the rest of the Chilean benevolence is gone.”
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue to negotiate at some point, but after what has happened, it will be extremely difficult to initiate a dialogue.
The two countries have not had ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltsé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagrees with the statement that court decision-making would have been unusually quick.
Monday gives Bolivia an “extraordinary opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile” and a chance to “come out well after 139 years of strife,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime debate to make a political advantage of it.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific,” he added.
“The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond the past.”
North Korea: No nuclear disarmament until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho said his country would not be the first to disarm nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke in front of the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at the Singapore Summit of the leaders of the two rival countries.
He made the remark when it appeared that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had succeeded in restarting the stalled nuclear negotiations more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, I “desire” to believe that continuing sanctions and blocking the US declaration to end the Korean War will ever be enough to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both US Presidents Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump have called for a new summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s commitment to disarming the arsenal, which the country is likely to see as the only key to its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Phenjani next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows showcase the huge headgear that will soon appear in top-class stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely cover the day, you don’t have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their Spring/Summer 2019 collection, which was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats made a sensation on Instagram this summer, and the above fashion designers also set their attention-grabbing works on the runway.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat, decorated with a feather-like wide flange and almost completely absorbed the heads of the models.
Among the other oversized accessories, there were gemstoned watermelons, a magic pot, and even a pineapple, which were not really designed to keep a person’s head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their mouths sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than the haute couture.
One of them looked like a diving mask with a pipe and glasses, and the other looked like a melting funnel ice cream.
If you are into these spectacular pieces, then you are in luck.
Style analysts predict that huge hats may already be on their way to top-class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the “La Bomba” trail, a 60 cm wide straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski has seen.
The cult brand behind the scarcely practical hat that conquered the social networking sites presented another piece on the runway: a beach bag made of straw, almost the size of the swimwear model that held it.
The dark orange rafia bag – decorated with rhinestones and a white leather grip on top – was one of the highlights of Jacquemus’ La Riviera Spring/Summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect huge hats and beach bags to appear next summer in top-of-the-line clothing stores. The designer has created such an elementary effect on everyone that it would be hard to deny the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have traditionally provided excellent education. Looking at recent outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed until 2018, which is further reinforced by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are already enrolled in institutions of this kind, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strive to provide the best possible services to students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers and their roles as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where it is possible to design and implement customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to prove to be popular and sought-after subjects.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to someone in a language they understand, they get to their head.
But if you speak in his language, it goes to his heart.”
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s exam results show that students from independent schools across the country have produced the best results from foreign languages.
Of all students studying a foreign language, 68 per cent achieved a higher grade A (over 85 per cent).
According to the data collected from the 74 member schools of SCIS, 72 percent of students received a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved a A grade.
These findings also show that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as essential knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Nowadays, languages, as chosen subjects, have become at least as important as natural sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics in both independent and non-independent schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Vocational Training found that 17 percent of employers said they found it difficult to fill vacancies because of a lack of language skills.
We can see from this that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for young people to have successful careers.
As knowledge of foreign languages is expected in an increasing number of workplaces, language skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have studied a foreign language, you will gain a life-long knowledge that will bring you clear benefits.
Being able to communicate directly with people of other nationalities automatically gives a competitive advantage to applicants who speak more than one language.
According to a survey by YouGov, which surveyed 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents did not speak a foreign language well enough to communicate with others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent (15 percent).
Therefore, it is important to place emphasis on language teaching for children right now.
Speaking more languages, especially in developing countries, can be a tool for children to be equipped to apply for more important jobs as adults.
Every school in Scotland will be dealing with different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while more will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese that are expected to be of paramount importance for the UK by 2020.
Whatever your child’s area of interest, they will be able to learn multiple elective languages at independent schools and will be trained by educators who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and equips them with the skills they will need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is not difficult to realize that in today’s global business environment, languages remain vital for the future of a country, and education must reflect this.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should rather be treated as a "international communication skill".
Independent schools offer a choice, diverse and quality education for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire – this is how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts with Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
It won’t be long before the fans who are on the verge of seeing LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the preseason opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you will spend on the track is still questionable.
"More than one, and less than 48," Walton wrote on Lakers' official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play for a limited time.
After training a few days ago, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers in the six-game preseason.
“At this point in my career, I don’t have to play in the preseason to be ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign and YouTube Channel
Donald Trump will start a long line of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be Trump’s first of five announced events next week, including stops in support of him in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm the candidate for the vacant seat of the Supreme Court has been postponed, Trump is trying to gather supporters for the upcoming mid-term elections, as there is a risk that the Republicans will lose power over Congress when the votes run out in November.
When will Trump’s West Virginia event start tonight, and where can you follow it online?
Trump’s speech to Wheeling (West Virginia) will begin tonight, on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
Trump’s meeting in West Virginia can also be watched online via YouTube live streaming.
Trump is likely to be involved in this week’s hearing of his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which has been particularly tense in light of allegations of sexual harassment, and the Senate’s confirmation vote has been suspended for no more than a week while the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary goal of the sudden increase in events is to help the Republican situation ahead of the November elections.
Trump’s campaign adviser said next week’s five events will serve to “activate voters and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they currently hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“To have control of Congress in his hands is so critical of his political plans that the president visits as many states as possible. We are facing a tight campaign period,” a campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The event planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight “can bring supporters from the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and even be included in media coverage in Pittsburgh,” West Virginia Metro News says.
This Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is not in a favorable position according to surveys.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to intercede in person to get better at the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team fights full-shoulder before Sunday’s singles to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, the four-games on Saturday afternoon were desperately needed for the Ryder Cup.
The pendulum of luck and momentum is a rather airy sports concept, yet every player believes in it, especially in tournaments such as the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
"They had a six-point lead and they only have four points left, so we can say we have the ball right now," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe is still leading by four points, and twelve more can be achieved.
Americans, as Spieth relates, feel that they’ve finally got a little bit of backwind and can draw encouragement from a lot of things, including the shapes of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and both scored three out of four points.
Spieth proved to be infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His bay victory cries became louder as he moved forward with the round, hitting and leveling with a critical roll in the fourth match, so that he and Thomas were at a double disadvantage after two.
Rolling the game at hole 15 resulted in a similar shout of joy, a kind that can make the spectator believe that not everything is lost for the American team.
“All you have to do is dig deep inside and take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s exactly what’s waiting for players.
18 holes for a chance to leave a trail.
Over the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular pair at the Ryder Cup, scored more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe’s strange but adorable couple brought four out of four and they don’t seem to be able to make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to perform above par on Saturday afternoons, and on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and Friday mornings, they performed similarly in the last nine stages.
Thanks to this series and the dynamics that have developed between them and the audience who support them so noisyly, they have become the benchmark for Sunday, and no one is more expected to secure Europe’s victory on Le Golf National with the Sun’s receipt than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best would be a win at different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to celebrate the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon executed Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the hero of the morning four, while playing with Alex Noren.
Once and twice with two beats over the par, the Spanish and Swedish scored the first nine holes, pushing them into a downhill from which they had no chance to climb out.
But on Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of your pit.
Four-ball games and four-ball matches are extremely fun to watch closely thanks to the interactions between the pairs. You can watch who gives what advice, what not, and how the strategy can change in a flash.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and it starts with a significant advantage for the last day, but this section four has shown that the American team has the courage to fight, even though many of them have been missing, especially from the American side.
Europe starts last day of Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage
Europe can start the final day of the Ryder Cup with a positive advantage after finishing the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday with a 10-6 result against the United States.
The twins Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race, winning two victories against the infirm Tiger Woods, raising the difference to four points on the course of Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European team, which is trying to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning’s four-ball matches, winning the series 3-1.
“America showed more resistance in the fours, bringing in two matches, but they still couldn’t make the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needs to score eight points from Sunday's 12-in-one game to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari – who are referred to as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend – are the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup, scoring four points in four opening games.
After beating Woods–Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they beat unmotivated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau to a definite 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes glittered his talents, but lost 19 of his 29 games of fours and fours, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning four-ball game, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson, and in the fours he defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world rankings, 2&1.
However, Europe did not succeed in all this on this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed Americans how to do it.
They won a two-and-a-half victory in the four-balls against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-and-a-half after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team only managed to come back twice from a four-point draw in individual races, although Furyk's defending team only had one draw to hold the trophy.
However, after two days of being only the second best, a counterattack on Sunday seems quite unrealistic.
"There's no way North Korea could unilaterally dismiss you if you don't trust your interlocutor."
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions had only increased its mistrust of the United States, and that there was no way the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Jongho told the UN’s Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant and generous steps” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, shutting down sites for nuclear tests, and promising not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
"Unfortunately, we do not see similar responses from the Americans," he said.
“Without trust in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not guaranteed, and under these circumstances, it is impossible to dismiss unilaterally and first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea’s frustration at Washington’s resistance to the idea of “phased” nuclear disarmament, a scenario in which North Korea would be rewarded for the steps taken so far, his statement seemed significant because he did not explicitly reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between an incumbent U.S. President and North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim promised to work on “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s integrity.
North Korea is trying to put an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. believes that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has not yet given in to tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“America is insisting on starting with nuclear disarmament, and it is increasing the pressure with sanctions to force its will on us, and it is also protesting against the possibility of declaring the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that sanctions that are not alleviating only increase our suspicions.”
Ri did not mention that a second summit was planned between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president specifically mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
He said that there had been three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jein over the past five months, adding: “If the country involved in nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate.”
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that North America’s targeting with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump, the “evil president,” called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" to North Korea, overwhelmed Kim with praise for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but he also noted that there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions will remain until North Korea implements nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit, meaning “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Pyongyang for the steps taken so far.
In contrast, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions imposed by the Security Council must be strictly adhered to until we have achieved actual, final, demonstrable nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with R<0xC3><0xAD> during a break at the UN General Assembly, and then said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn’t go very well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him hours later of bringing up “gangster-like demands.”
At a meeting with Munnal this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
Mun said the “sufficient steps” Kim was talking about would be security safeguards that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as steps that could lead to a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to take enough rest.
A new subject at Harvard University this year has prompted students to sleep more, fighting the growing macho culture of caffeinated whole-night learning.
One academic concluded that students at the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care for themselves.
The course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S., was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard College of Medicine and practicing as a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
He was inspired by the fact that he had previously given a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and asked, ‘Why do I have to face this now, as a senior?’
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told the Telegraph.
The course, launched for the first time this year, introduces students to the fundamental impact of good sleep habits on their academic and athletic performance, in addition to having a positive impact on their overall well-being.
According to Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the University’s Health Service, the university decided to start the course because the students were found to be extremely sleepless during the week.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one, for example, they show a picture of a dormitory room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and why bedtime routines matter.
In another section, participants are shown how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
They present a map of the campus area with interactive icons to encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change the behavior of our students.
But we think they have a right to this knowledge – just as they have a right to be aware of the health effects of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of learning through the night continues to flourish, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students are causing growing problems with sleep deprivation.
Sufficient and quality sleep is the student’s “secret weapon” in combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain into a starving mode and causes a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler design the course, a 19-year-old Californian student studying chemistry and biophysics, and last year he took a first-time course at Harvard.
He said that what he heard there had opened his eyes and encouraged him to advocate for a university-level education.
He hopes that as a next step, postgraduate students will also be able to participate in a similar training program before they find employment in the competitive sector.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a bedtime alert, a wake-up call, and familiarize themselves with the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electrical screens and LED light sources, which can easily deflect them from their daily rhythm and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1–0: Menga defeats Gerrard and scores a goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb drove Steven Gerrard's disintegrated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibroxians attempted to win their first away win after a 4-1 win at St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered a second defeat from Gary Holt's 18 games as manager.
Menga struck seven minutes before the halftime, and the unmotivated Rangers team was not even close to equalizing.
While the Rangers slid down to sixth, Livingston climbed to third, only lagging behind the Hibernian due to the goal difference.
In addition, the Rangers may face additional difficulties after the beach marker Calum Spence was in need of medical attention due to a head injury due to an object that was probably dropped from the guest's stands.
Gerrard changed eight points on the team that made it to the Betfred Cup semi-finals by sweeping Ayr.
Holt joined Livingston with the same 11 men who took a point from the Hearts last week, and he would have been happy to see his team choke his opponent's game wherever he could.
Although the Rangers led in ball possession, Livingston did more with what he got.
They could have scored a goal in the first two minutes, when Menga set off Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed to sell the kitcer.
Keaghan Jacobs landed a low free kick at captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow only hit the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt he deserved a penalty at the fifteenth minute of his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers had only two shots at the first half goal, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi’s attempt in the 34th minute went against the game, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers have again missed a trick forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react in time when Declan Gallagher pushed the ball to Scott Robinson, who had found Menga to make it easy.
Gerrard decided to pause, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately had an impact on the game when the extreme Morelos was teasing, but Kelly was blocking in time for the stunning form.
Livingston continued to play exactly the kind of game that suited him, and Lithgow and Halkett swept the long balls one after the other.
Holt's team could have had a greater advantage in the last minutes, but McGregor took the net well and smashed Jacobs' position before Lithgow missed from a corner.
Glenn Middleton, who was replacing the Rangers, attempted to win another eleven when he encountered Jacobs, but Thomson was still unsuccessful.
Almanach: inventor of the Geiger counter
An excerpt from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, now exactly 136 years ago... the day the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that could have led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been a fundamental tool of science ever since, and thanks to the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" (The Bells of Coronado) featuring strange cowboy scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, it has become a part of pop culture:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that can be used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put on this headphone, you can hear the sound of the atoms emitted because of the radioactivity of the minerals.”

New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to “See” Abnormal Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to “See” and Destroy Abnormal Cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment teaches the immune system to recognise abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a laboratory.
In this way, they are able to "see" the protein that accompanies many types of cancer. The treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells could say goodbye to her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient; modifying them in the laboratory to “see” a protein called HER2, which is a common accompaniment to multiple cancers; and then replanting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "stimulates the growth of multiple cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and rectum cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, based on highlighting immune cells and “teaching” them how to attack cancer cells, has previously been successfully used in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West’s SNL role, wearing the MAGA cap, culminated in a defamatory tirade supporting Trump.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was whistled at Saturday Night Live Studios after an incoherent statement in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would apply for the presidency in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, in his make America Great Again cap, he began to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to someone who’s white, they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s racist?’
“If I were interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL was opened by Matt Damon with a parody of Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
Although it was not aired, the video of West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to make fun of West with the charge.
West even complained to the audience that he was being bullied behind the scenes for his hat.
“I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out in that hat.’
I'm intimidated!
And they said I was in the sunken place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see a sunken place? I’m going to put on my Superman cape, because that means they can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
His manifestations were accompanied by whistles from the audience at least twice, and the SNL characters seemed awkward, according to one eyewitness to Variety: "The whole studio was wrapped in a silent silence."
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days earlier.
West raised questions when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as Perrier glass.
Westet, head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, said in a tweet: “Thank you to one of the bravest ghosts: you’ve talked to the crowd.”
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply “herself, and that’s great.”
“But I have decided not to reward anyone (by buying his music or fashion items or by supporting his ‘art’) who I believe has an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
And so are we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now he is “the creature previously known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast Restaurant Knife Accused of Attempted Murder
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballypackamore.
The defendant is due to appear at the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, finds exaggerated masculinity harmful
Kit Harington is best known as the Jon Snow of Game of Thrones, and in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, he often grabs a sword.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke out against stereotypical macho heroes, stressing that seeing such heroes, little boys can often feel that hard action is needed to earn respect.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought “something went wrong” and raised the question of how to deal with the harmful effects of exaggerated masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
The star, who recently married her 31-year-old series colleague Rose Leslie, said she thought it was important to fix the problem.
“I’m personally quite deeply affected by this matter – how did the representation of masculinity get so distorted?” the actor asked.
“What did we teach men as children about the problem we are facing now?”
According to Kit, television is also responsible for spreading the distorted image of masculinity, as the shows often feature very masculine characters.
He went on to say: “What is it that is born of us, and what is it that we learn?
What does the street and TV tell young boys that makes them feel like they can only be men in this way?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change that.
Because it is clear that something is wrong with young men.”
Kit said in the interview that after the end of the series’ summer season, he will not be appearing in Game of Thrones series or sequels because he is “tired of the battlefields and the horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will star in the remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, a film about a producer and his robbery-loving brother.
The actor said the best thing he got from Game of Thrones was his wife, Rose, whom he met during the series.
“I met my wife on set, so I owe my future family and the life ahead of me to the show,” Kit said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Number of new patients in China increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in the country.
According to health officials, this is more than 820,000 affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of reported cases increased by about 40,000.
The fact that the vast majority of newly infected people are sexually infected means a change compared to the past.
The disease has spread rapidly through transfusions of infected blood in parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province said that the number of such cases has since declined to nearly zero.
Despite this, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
According to estimates in various studies, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men end up marrying a woman because of the country’s conservative values.
The disease spreads in these relationships in many cases due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of a program to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her staff members leaked data from Republican senators and condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican senators on the senator's Wikipedia page.
According to the Democrat MP in Los Angeles, the allegations were spread by “extreme right-wing” experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies," Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information released allegedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham and Utah senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was posted on Thursday. The publisher's identity is unknown, but it is certain that it was posted from the Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual harassment by Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate.
The leak occurred shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState say the IP address that can be identified as a source is linked to Waters’ office, and they have also disclosed data on a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reports.
"These allegations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously lying," Waters said.
– My staff member is not responsible for any leaks of information. However, your right to anonymity, protection of your personal data and security has been violated due to fraudulent and lying accusations.
These allegations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously lying.”
Waters' statements were quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary.
“It’s an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“It would appear that Mr Waters does not have the temperament to hold the office.
If a person is suspected of something he has not done, he cannot react angryly.
You can't be defiant.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
You have to stay calm and calm.”
Waters’ reaction was apparently compared to that of Judge Kavanaugh, who appeared too angry at Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate to run for Waters in the mid-term elections, also shared his views on Twitter.
“If it’s true, then it’s serious,” he wrote in his message.
Waters said in a statement that his office had notified the “appropriate authorities and law enforcement” of the false allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are identified and legally held accountable for any act that endangers or harms any member of my crew.”
Johnny English strikes again, or Rowan Atkinson's lame spy comedy
Nowadays, it has become a tradition to look for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there can be no exception to this, Johnny English is an action comedy/parody franchise, of which the first part, Johnny English in 2003, and the second, Johnny English Reloaded, was released in 2011.
Will the new export product of the British nation be the sarcastic, self-parodying satires in which we cheer on our own obvious paralysis?
What is certain is that Johnny English, who was blinding, rubber-faced, incompetent, had enough ammunition to make a comeback – it is clear from his name that this comic character was created so that crowds of viewers could laugh at it in cinemas in non-English-speaking countries of the world.
Johnny English is, of course, a crazy undercover agent who thinks he's attractive with his bizarre manners, so he reminds me a little of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally of the guy who, by pressing a single key, contributed to the premiere of the Fire Trucks at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is also based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, who left chaos everywhere.
There are a few good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved how Johnny English, dressed in medieval armor, approached a helicopter, and when he got there, the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson’s comedic vein is well established in the film, but the film’s humour doesn’t really work, and it seems superfluous, as today’s “serious” franchises like the James Bond films and the Mission Impossible series are bravely reaching for the means of humor.
To feel that the humor of the film is more aimed at children, and to me Johnny English’s crazy, failed adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal broke into the British spy network’s top-secret online network and revealed the identities of all British agents to the greatest horror of on-call agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got a small part of the film.
This could be the last nail in the coffin of the arrogant and divisive prime minister, whose political popularity is in ruins anyway: Emma Thompson practically plays Theresa May and brings everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisers suggest that since the identity of every active agent has been revealed, he must set up a retired agent.
This retired agent is, of course, Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher at a high school since he retired, but is teaching children to spy – there are of course some funny scenes here, while English explains the basics of spying in a “Rockschool” way.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where at the emergency briefing, he reunites with his former, much-suffered arms carrier, Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough has since been married and married the captain of a submarine, who is always up to his ears – played by Vicki Pepperdine, who is destined for better roles.
So his majesty's national security officer, Batman and Robin, is back in action and confronts Ophelia Bulletova, portrayed by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as the true woman of fate.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is increasingly enthralled by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and he is portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their clown mission by setting fire to a fancy French restaurant disguised as a waiter, then smuggle themselves into Volta’s luxury yacht amidst an astonishing turmoil, and English is set free from hell when he tries to get to know Volta’s apartment using a VR-headset.
These stations are needed to get to the end, but no matter how cheerful and twisting it is, it gives a bit too much the impression of a children’s film.
The end result is mediocre.
As with the other Johnny English films, I was wondering: Couldn’t the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
The British Labour Party denies it would introduce a four-day working week while paying the British a five-day wage.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical plan: to introduce a four-day working week, with workers working for five days' wages.
The party allegedly wants workers to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, so that CEOs can give employees an extra day off thanks to increased revenue.
Under the plan, workers would be given a three-day weekend while taking home the same amount as before.
According to the sources, the idea “should” fit into the party’s economic program, the aim of which is to tilt the balance sheet language to the workers’ side of the country.
The idea of a four-day working week is also supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, according to which workers could also benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen overnight, a four-day working week is an idea that fits well into the party’s agenda to tilt the balance to the workers in the economy, and also fits into the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party already campaigned in the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of a four-day working week.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not one of the policies supported by the party, and the issue is not even on the agenda.”
At the Labour Conference last week, John McDonnell, the shadow finance minister, presented his vision of a socialist revolution affecting the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to fight to regain power from the “faceless directors” and the “beneficiaries” of the regimes.
If the plans of the shadow finance minister were implemented, the shareholders of the water companies would not be able to get back the full profits due to them, since a Labour government would use “deductions” as a punishment for allegedly harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that he plans to make workers a member of the board of directors and create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would allocate 10% of the shares in private sector companies to employees, who could receive a dividend of <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on 60 Minutes whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
As a result of the FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on Kavanaugh’s election to the Supreme Court will be held at least a week later than the original date. The question is whether the outcome of the investigation could discredit Republican MPs enough to not support Kavanaugh.
In a 60 Minutes interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something to change their minds about.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“That’s what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case broke out, after the charges came up, and I asked him, “Did you do it?”
His answer was clear and clear.”
However, Graham’s vote seems concrete-proof.
“I’ve already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and I need very serious charges to change my mind,” Graham said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied the allegations,” Graham said, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people named by Dr. Ford have substantiated the allegations.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don’t think anything new will come out.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival and have you managed to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City will host the annual music event Global Citizens Festival, where stars from around the world will take part in a truly noble effort to eradicate poverty globally.
The Global Citizens Festival will be held for the seventh time, with tens of thousands expected to fill the Great Grass of Central Park, where participants will not only be able to enjoy the performance of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but will also be able to draw attention to the true purpose of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival was first held in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project, run by an international advocacy group that aims to eradicate poverty by engaging more and more people in the active fight against poverty.
The concert is free of charge for those (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) who undertake certain tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a senior politician, a phone call, or any other meaningful activity to draw attention to the purpose of the project: the eradication of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen really been in achieving its goals over the past 12 years?
Is it really an effective way to reward people with a concert ticket to convince others about the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called “clicktivism” when people feel they have made a meaningful contribution to a cause by signing an online petition or writing a Twitter post?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen data, more than 19 million “actions” have been carried out by the project’s supporters, serving a variety of different purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have helped world leaders allocate <0x24>37 billion to policies and commitments to combat poverty that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and announcements to come from their actions, of which <0x24>10 billion have already been paid or collected through fundraising.
The group estimates that the money collected has directly affected the lives of nearly 649 million people.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and contractors that aims to “help children reach their full potential”. The organization has pledged <0x24>35 million to help Rwanda eradicate hunger after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from “global citizens”.
“With the support of the UK government and donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can banish social injustice and malnutrition into the footnotes of history books,” Tracey Ullman, the Power of Nutrition ambassador, told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after asking the UK in more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and their children, the government has allocated funds for the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen’s website is, “Why do you think extreme poverty can be eradicated?”
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult journey, one in which we sometimes get stuck and sometimes fail.
But like previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we will achieve our goal because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e will be presenting at this year’s event in New York, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as hosts.
Home Secretary: U.S. would use naval “blockade” to block Russian energy exports
"If necessary," Washington would even use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, so Russia's energy could not reach the Middle East, according to US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
According to Zinke, Russia’s active presence in Syria, especially with regard to Russian operations carried out at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is just an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think the only reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the Interior Minister, there are ways to stop the Russians.
“The United States of America, with its navy, is able to ensure that sea routes are open and can block them if necessary, so that it can ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington’s actions against Russia and Iran and noted that they were practically the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically in much the same way: by using existing energy sources and introducing new ones,” Zinke said, while calling Russia a “one-dimensional economy,” pointing out the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.
These statements coincide with the Trump administration’s plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, pushing Russia out of the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
That is why senior officials in the Trump administration, including the president himself, are persuading Germany to withdraw from the “wrong” pipeline project known as North Stream 2, which, if implemented, will make Germany a “hostage” to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so vehemently opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
"I assume that we share the same view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be given the opportunity to freely choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The Americans’ attempt to convince him went backwards, as Germany reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy, just as it should stay away from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it a problem when a third country interferes in our energy affairs," Dieter Kempf, president of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), said after the last meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren is “seriously considering” running for the presidency in 2020
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was “seriously considering” running for the presidency after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed at a meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts, that he was considering leaving.
“It’s time for women to get into Washington and rebuild a dysfunctional government, and it’s time for a woman to be president,” Warren told The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for the presidency.”
At the city meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren has vehemently criticized Trump and Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, “Well, of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, according to a survey published Thursday, most of Warren’s Massachusetts voters don’t think Warren should run for presidency in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk Political Analysis Center and the Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren “a good chance” do not think the senator should run for the presidency, while 58% of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren “a good chance” do not think the senator should run for president.
Thirty-two percent support Warren's candidacy.
According to the survey, the majority of those polled would support Deval Patrick’s presidential candidacy, 38% would support it and 48% would oppose it.
In the 2020 presidential election, high-ranking Democratic politicians such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont were named.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will decide by January.
Sarah Palin Tracks Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's Meeting
26-Year-Old Track Palin Served in Iraq for a Year After Applying in September
Arrested Monday night for domestic violence charges
“What my son is going through, what he’s been going through since he came home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are coming home with,” Sarah Palin told the audience at Donald Trump’s meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his son's arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that his son, like other war veterans, "has returned in a change, hardened state, and is constantly wondering whether he has the respect for the service that his comrades, the pilots, and all the other members of the army have done for the country."
Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, said in a report that Track Palin had committed domestic violence with a gun and drunkenness.
18 member states and Washington, D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 member states and Washington, D.C. support a judicial review of the new U.S. asylum policy that excludes those fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 different states and Washington, D.C., wrote an expert letter in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who is attacking the policy in court, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, a case initiated by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
The plaintiff claims that her partner and “the sons of that violent gang” assaulted her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
The woman is in custody in Texas.
Prosecutors in the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the places from which many asylum applications have come to the United States because of the continuing problems of gang violence and domestic violence in these countries.
The new U.S. refugee policy has revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) to allow undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum fleeing domestic violence.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “leaves out decades of state, federal, and international law.”
“Under federal law, all asylum applications must be assessed according to the facts and circumstances of the case, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the letter said.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that the policy of rejecting immigration is damaging to the U.S. economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “fill the lowest-level jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered asylum judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and criminal gangs.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country on the grounds of racial, religious, national, social, political, or well-founded fear of persecution,” Sessions said at the announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum is not designed to solve all the problems people face every day around the world, no matter how serious they may be.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu, the number of dead has doubled, rescue teams are racing against time
The situation of the survivors is becoming more and more hopeless.
“Everyone is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she calms her febrile son at a evacuation centre in the disaster-stricken Palu.
Ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We hardly have any drinking water.”
Some residents returned to their demolished homes to rescue the soaked things that were still to be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were also damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are struggling to care for people.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken spine and shoulder, were transported to the Palui Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outside the hospital building due to heavy aftershocks.
The man’s eyes were filled with tears as he recalled the fifth-floor hotel room in which his wife and daughter were staying, trembling into the devastating quake.
“There was no time to escape.
“I think I’m stuck in the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassing the country with propaganda
The U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily that emphasized the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade relations.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to an advertisement in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa’s top-selling newspaper, while accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6. China denies the accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election is a new stage in Washington’s ever-increasing crackdown on China, according to some U.S. officials who told Reuters.
Although it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertising, there is an intensifying trade war between Beijing and Washington, with more and more tariffs on each other’s imports.
According to US and Chinese experts, Chinese tariffs in response to the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters from countries where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, including Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor for several terms, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses, as the state of Iowa was exporting significant amounts of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an opinion article published on Sunday in the Des Moines Register that “China is further harassing our country by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“However, if we go to a newspaper shop in Beijing, we can hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not at all faithfully reflect the different and divergent views of the Chinese people on the increasingly bleak growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.”
Branstad added that “one of China’s most famous newspapers refused to bring down” his article, but did not name the newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans could alienate female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh scandal
Analysts say it may turn out that many high-ranking Republican politicians are defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of allegations of sexual harassment. This could in particular lead to a loss of support for female voters before the midterm elections.
The incident sparked intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be retracted, says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last-minute FBI investigation proposed by Republican senator Jeff Flake would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
According to Mic, some protesters in the Senate corridor on Friday morning chanted “November is approaching!” as the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination.
“There will be an astonishing surge in democratic enthusiasm and motivation,” independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told reporters.
“Many people say it’s already been very tall, and it’s true.
But it can be even higher, especially among precarious female voters in suburbs and young people (aged 18-29) who, although not enthusiastic about the president, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford's public statement, analysts assumed he could strike back at the Republicans if they continued to stand up for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Since then, Ford has described in detail in his statement why he accused the Supreme Court candidate of sexual harassment.
"The Republican Party has been on a sluggish path," Michael Steele, the former president of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, it’s also about how the Republicans handled the case and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, the director of Priorities USA.
However, it seems that Americans are rather divided about whether they believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh to be true.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony in full or rather, and 35% of Kavanaugh’s respondents gave the same answer.
In addition, 38% of the respondents said that Kavanaugh probably lied or lied about his testimony, while only 30% of the respondents believed this about Ford.
In response to Flake’s motion, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations, as is Deborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh’s other accuser.
A week ago, Ford pleaded under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had harassed him drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party in the 1980s, when they were both studying at Yale.
The inventor of the World Wide Web would launch a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access the information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to “take control of the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data warehouse”, also known as POD.
This can include lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
This is like having access to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify from the same browser at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data warehouse is that the user can decide who has access to his or her data.
The company calls this “the realization of the individual’s right to self-determination over data”.
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the company’s mission is to provide the resources, processes, and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt.
Berners-Lee said he and his team weren’t asking Facebook and Google “whether to introduce a technology that would completely turn their business models upside down overnight.”
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of Solidra’s newly built network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute despite the launch of Inrupt.
“I am endlessly optimistic about the next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann, a Victorian-Crusader pastor in World War I
The only Anglican pastor to receive the Victorian Cross celebrates in his hometown 100 years after his heroic deed in World War I.
Reverend Bernard Vann and Colonel-in-Chief earned the award during the September 29, 1918 attacks in Bellenglise and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he never knew he had earned the highest award from the British Armed Forces.
The memorial was unveiled by two grandchildren at a Saturday ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “symbolic” that the memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s meritorious act.
According to the London Gazette, Reverend Bernard Vann and Lieutenant Colonel led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, "in the midst of thick fog and fierce cannon and machine gun fire."
Later, he hurried to the front line and, with "extraordinary heroism," took the lead of the battalion, then attacked a camp cannon detachment on his own, destroying three of its members.
Reverend Bernard Vann and lieutenant colonel were shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
“I know I’ll never get back to what my grandfather did, and that taught me humility,” said Michael Vann, 72.
After the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, wreathed the memorial stone.
Michael Vann said he felt honored to play a part in the ceremony and added: “The courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the number of people who later pay him tribute.”
MMA fans spent the whole night watching Bellator 206 broadcast, instead they got Peppa pig.
Imagine waking up all night to watch the thrilling Bellator 206, and the broadcast is cancelled.
The San José show featured 13 clashes, six of which were broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK as part of the main competition.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, Peppa pig was on the show instead of the game, to the surprise of the British spectators.
This was a resentment of many who stayed up until the early hours of the morning because of this particular clash.
Instead of the MMA game, one of the fans described the children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke" on Twitter.
"According to state regulations, this kind of content can no longer be broadcast by 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to children's shows," Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of communications and marketing at Bellator, said in a statement.
“Yes, it’s Peppa’s time.”
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, promised that in the future, the schedule of the show would be revised to include UK viewers.
"I think we can do it all over again," Coker said.
“But since it’s 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there, until the Sunday of our time, which is already Monday for them, we can’t fix the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show switched, there were a lot of messages, and most of them weren't very friendly.
At first we thought we had a technical problem, so we tried to fix it.
But it wasn't that. It was a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
There will only be five matches instead of six so far – we wanted to please the spectators very much, but we accounted for ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley struggled with a minority complex due to his sexual orientation
Diving Olympian Tom Daley said that when he was young, he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation, but that was what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until high school that “not everyone is like him”.
On Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne said she stood up for gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He added that since he became a parent, he has been much less interested in the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-lived show, missed several months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who was invited as a "shipwrecker," said that as a young man he felt "less" than anyone else because "it was not socially acceptable for someone to love both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day it is the feeling of inferiority and differentiation that I draw strength and perseverance from in order to achieve my successes.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth “something” so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when his sexual orientation was revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known representative of the LGBT community and, taking advantage of his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia, has called on governments around the world to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live his life openly, without negative consequences, and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was “completely surprised” when he fell in love with another man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley and his 20-year-old Oscar-winning screenwriter got married last year, and he said the age difference was never a problem.
“If you’re going through so much when you’re young,” he said, “at the age of 14 you were at your first Olympics, and your father died of cancer three years later.”
The couple adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said it completely upset his attitude towards the world.
“If I had been asked this question last year, I would have said the most important thing was to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But you know what I realized? There are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Daley's father, Robert, died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn’t want to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t answer him, ‘Dad, you won’t be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, but until that moment I couldn’t accept that my father wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I felt that this is what I’ve dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympic Games, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
Heather Small Proud (Proud) helped her prepare for the Olympics and she will still get goose bumps if she hears it.
Desert Island Discs will start Sunday at 11:15 local time on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson was out of shape and put on a bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson can set a record by taking part in his 47th game at the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he must regain his form if he does not want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson plays for the 12th time at the biennial event, but due to his performance in four-ball and four-game matches on Saturday, team captain Jim Furyk sent him to the bench.
Instead of being at the centre of events in big tournaments, a player with five victories, like so many times when he had to fight for a U.S. victory, now cheers for his team one half of the day, spends the other half practicing on the pitch and trying to correct mistakes that weaken his game.
At the height of his career, he was never one of the most accurate batters, so the 48-year-old doesn’t really fit into the narrow course of Le Golf National, where high grass means he has to pay a very high price for the wrong shots.
And if the track itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches with beginner Tommy Fleetwood this week, in the ninth game on Sunday.
If Americans with a four-point handicap start strong before 12 singles matches, Mickelson’s match may be crucial.
Furyk claims to trust the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of the role he played in today’s development, he patted me on the back, held me in his arms and promised to be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
– Extremely confident.
He is one of the biggest and has done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
I didn’t want to play two games for him.
I planned more, but in the given situation, we decided that this was the best option.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson’s performance on Sunday will break Nick Faldo’s record for a match that no one has played before in the Ryder Cup.
This will close a series in the Ryder Cup that is far below the player's individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, but Furyk emphasized that the veteran’s presence does not bring any tangible benefits to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with others, he’s a great team member,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed the games against him, and it’s good to see that.
His presence goes beyond the game in the strict sense.”
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows that they can easily lose the advantage they have gained.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if one gets a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup with individual matches, luck can easily turn his back on him.
The Danish player first made his debut in a game at Valderrama in 1997, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros scored a five-point lead over the Americans, and in the end, they barely managed to keep a hairy lead to a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win.
“We always have to remind ourselves that even though we had a big advantage in Valderrama, we only won by a hair’s length, and we also had a big advantage in Brookline, where we finally lost,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said in the photo after the 2018 class’s 5–3 win on Friday and yesterday, driving 10–6 on the course of Le Golf National.
“It’s enough to think about previous years’ races, and everyone can see that the game isn’t over yet.
You're gonna have to play with all your strength tomorrow.
So let's go and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to focus on right now.
“As I said before, I mostly deal with the 12 players on our team, but we also have to look at the other side, which happens to be among the biggest players in the world.”
Proud of the team’s performance on the difficult track, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: “I would never make predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow is a completely different day.
Then it all depends on individual performance, which is completely different from team play.
It’s a great feeling to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you stand out individually, it’s all about what kind of golfer you really are.
That’s what you need to make the players understand, so that tomorrow they can get the best out of themselves on the field.
They have to break off from their partner, who will also have to make the best of it.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, is confident that his players will perform better in singles than in pairs, except for a double of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk personally experienced both sides of the Last Day Resurrections: in Brookline, he was a member of the winning team, then on the losing side after the European team’s so-called “medinah miracle.”
"I remember every damn word he said," he replied, as he was asked, "because he encouraged the players before the last day, Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999."
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we’re getting the best start as fast as we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medinah.
If one of the teams really gets into it, it puts a lot of pressure on the opponent’s players in the middle matches.
We have set the order accordingly and have prepared our players so that they can perform a real miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of leading an effort to reverse the position, playing against Rory McIlroy in the first match, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
“I chose this order because I think that’s how the picture comes together from beginning to end,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added to the individual line-up.
Germany's newest warship has been postponed
The German navy’s latest frigate was supposed to be in service in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially rising costs, this is expected to happen at least until next year.
The inauguration of the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, “Rheinland-Pfalz”, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, the weekly Die Zeit wrote, citing an army spokesman.
The ship was initially scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the ongoing delays made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships to replace the Bremen-class ageing frigates.
It will be equipped with various anti-aircraft missiles and camouflage technology, including a signal damper that reduces the ship’s radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it requires less maintenance, which in practice means that these new frigates can be put into service for up to two years away from the mother ports.
However, because of the project’s continuous delay, these high-tech warships, which Germany could use to feel its power overseas, may become obsolete by the time they are finally put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The fateful F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to inaugurate it and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
Not much has been revealed about the reasons for the return, but the German media has cited several critical "software and hardware bugs" that make the warship unusable on a combat mission.
Software shortages are a major problem, as the Baden-Württemberg-class warships will have only 120 sailors, which is only half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been found that the ship is extremely overweight, which impairs its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further adjustments later on.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is said to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships the Germans put into service during World War II.
Apart from the faulty parts, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion), while the initial project was estimated at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the warnings that the presence of Germany at sea is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the National Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recently admitted that the navy was “starting to run out of ships in a bare state.”
According to the official, the problem has in the meantime become a self-exciting process, as the old ships had to be dismantled, but there are no more ships to replace the fallout.
He expressed concern that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the navy.
The National Trust is investigating the secret life of bats.
New research is underway on a Scottish Highland estate to find out how bats exploit the features of the landscape while hunting.
The researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of single flying mammals, which could also be useful for future conservation initiatives.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will study the behavior of common and soprano bats, as well as brown long-eared bats and water bats in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at the appropriate points in the area to record bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will use handheld detectors to collect mobile data.
A detailed analysis of the recordings’ sound material can be used to determine the frequency of bat sounds and what species are doing.
The researchers also produce a habitat map and a report, which can be used to determine in detail how the behavior of the animals develops depending on the landscape.
NTS conservation advisor Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal the most important habitats for bats and how they are used.
This information will help to determine the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as meadows, and how best to preserve forested areas for bats and other affected species.
The size of the bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the last century.
Construction and land development work disrupts the animals’ sleeping areas and reduces their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, as are exposed fly papers, certain chemical processes used in building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not completely blind.
But because they are night predators, they rely more on their hearing when they hunt prey than on their sight.
With their sophisticated technique based on ultrasound reflection, they can determine the exact location of insects and the objects in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
They work with ten trained professionals who regularly conduct studies and sleep-place tests, and occasionally participate in rescue work.
The organization created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
According to property manager David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
"There's a great place for bats in Threave," he said.
“There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else you need for a good living space.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats yet, and the work we’ve done here and in other areas like this will help us learn more about what they need to feel good about themselves.”
He also underlined the importance of making sure that there are bats living there before renovating buildings, as the destruction of a single site could result in the death of 400 females and juveniles, leading to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals, and their destruction, harassment and habitat disturbance are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, also called on the public to help.
"There is still a lot we don't know about bats, and we have almost no information about the population status of most domestic species."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “false news”. He believed that others wanted to use his name to “put them into the public eye”.
The lawyers of the football player are ready to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
A member of the Portuguese squad and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
The woman said the athlete paid him <0x24>375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were brought to light, Ronaldo, 33, told a 142 million-strong fanbase on Instagram that the news was “a lie.”
“No, no, no, no and no.
"All the things you've said about me today are lies," the five-times gold-ball player told the camera.
“They want to use my name to get into the public eye.
It happens.
They want to be famous by my name, that's the life of public figures.
I’m a happy person and my life is okay,” the player added, accompanied by a smile.
Due to allegations of "unacceptable, privacy-infringing allegations," Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, Reuters reports.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will file a claim for damages for "the moral damage caused to the extent of the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights committed in recent years."
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went up to the athlete’s suite, where the man was anal-raping a woman, according to documents filed with the District Attorney’s Office for Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told him he was “99 percent a good boy” except for “one percent.”
According to the information in the documents, Ronaldo admitted to having sexual relations with the woman, but he said it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and had an examination of her injuries made at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “fearful of retaliation” and “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel the deal, as the trauma caused by the incident continues to make her life bitter.
Ronaldo was about to be transferred to Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer the Italian giant Juve bought the player for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret' the loss of car factories
The UK will “regret forever” if it loses its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark said.
Toyota UK is "concerned" by a statement to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the car manufacturer will be forced to temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese automaker, a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses due to delays at the borders.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis production unit in Burnaston produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
“I see that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production shutdowns at the plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed concerns about the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without an agreement on how to trade across borders.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its production plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU countries.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, disruptions at the borders could lead to delays in production and a shortage of parts, according to industry representatives.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store spare parts for more than a day at its plant in Derbyshire, and production would have to be stopped.
Clark said his plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, was "precisely designed to avoid delaying checks at the border."
“We need an agreement, and we want an agreement on the best possible terms, not only to reap the benefits of our current successes, but also to offer new opportunities,” he said on BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers can confirm that we absolutely need to maintain our currently highly successful supply chain.”
Toyota could not say how long the production would last, but warned that the added costs could deteriorate the factory’s competitiveness in the long run, ultimately leading to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years at the plant in Burnaston and is currently representing the Unite trade union, trade union members are becoming increasingly concerned: “In my experience, we will never get back the jobs that will be lost at this time.”
A government spokesman said: “We have developed a precise and feasible plan for future EU relations.”
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House said.
"Another week could be postponed" for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump's high-profile meeting, as the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate continues, the White House said in a statement on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian influence in the elections, possible ties between Trump’s advisors and the Russian government, and possible obstructions of justice by Trump.
For months, Washington has been speculating whether Trump will eventually fire the deputy Attorney General, putting Mueller’s independence at risk.
According to the New York Times this month, Rosenstein considered coming to the meeting wearing a wire to record a conversation with the president, and the question was raised whether it would be possible to replace Trump under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied what was said.
He visited the White House on Monday and was rumored to be resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who then had a United Nations appearance in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he was “unwilling” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which postponed the final Senate vote even further.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We don’t have a fixed date yet, we can set a date for this week, but in the light of the cases before the Supreme Court, I see a chance for another one-week postponement.
We'll find out soon enough, and I'll, as always, let the press know."
However, some journalists have been hesitant to accept this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked about this.
Sanders replied that the rarity of the press conferences was not due to the "sensation-seeking" behavior of television reporters, but added: "I do not dispute the fact that they are really sensation-seeking."
He added that there would be more direct meetings between Trump and the media.
“The president gives more interviews with questions and answers than any previous president,” he said. He even added, without substantiating the allegation: “We looked at the numbers.”
There will be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, the light years are better than talking to me.
We often try to do that, and there have been many such occasions in the last few weeks, so instead of holding White House press conferences, you can talk to the President of the United States in person.”
Trump regularly answers questions from reporters when he leaves the White House or attends public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, press conferences held alone are quite rare.
Why, perhaps, can be inferred from what happened this week, when the president performed an unusual and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the assembled journalists in New York.
The head of the health ministry addressed a letter to NHS Scotland’s EU staff about concerns about Brexit
In a letter, the head of the Ministry of Health expressed gratitude to the employees of the Scottish NHS from European Union countries and stressed that he hoped they would stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's expected withdrawal.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of EU citizens working in a decentralised public service in relation to established status applications.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the withdrawal continued during the summer and a decision is expected in the autumn.
The UK government has also begun to prepare a scenario for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what a troubling time this can be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, no matter what country they come from.
Staff from different EU Member States and other countries provide valuable experience and expertise to help the healthcare ministry, which has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we would very much like you to stay with us.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, had an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ from Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
“He walked to the shoreline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
The coaching team and medical staff first gave oxygen to Abercrombie at the edge of the track, then put it on a stretcher and took it to further investigation.
A Tennessee State official in Nashville, Tennessee, told WSMV reporter Chris Harris that Abercrombie had completed the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he “does not yet know any further details about the type and extent of the injury,” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore who has been suspended for a year, spends his first season at Tennessee State, where he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, he showed five successful mountings before leaving the track, so he’s at 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees for properties bought in the UK
According to Toryk’s new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees for properties purchased in the UK, and the additional revenue would be used to support homeless people.
This move would neutralize Corbyn’s success among young voters.
The tax increase is aimed at those who are not taxed in the UK.
According to the Treasury, this would amount to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, which would be used to support the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees for properties bought in the UK, and the additional revenue will be used to support homeless people, Theresa May said at a press conference.
The move is likely to counterbalance Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters by promising more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The tax increase will affect individuals and companies that are not taxing in the UK, and the additional revenue will be used to combat homelessness.
The surcharge added to the current levy, which is calculated in addition to the higher levy imposed two years ago on second homes and properties purchased for the purpose of spending, can reach up to three per cent.
The State Treasury expects revenue of <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year as a result of the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are purchased by citizens outside the UK, causing significant price increases, making it increasingly difficult for first-time home buyers.
Many of the wealthy districts of the country have become “spirit cities”, especially in the capital, as there are many foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in fees to help young people waiting for their first home.
He personally held the construction corporations responsible for keeping real estate prices high, which had become a habit of buying land and leaving it on rags. He asked May to abolish the quotas for affordable houses and to do something about the “home market shame” situation in the country.
Corbyn announced remarkable proposals for a series of housing reforms, including rent control and the elimination of evictions without good reason.
It would also give the councils more powers and opportunities to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said that I would like to devote my prime ministership to restoring the English dream and making life better for every generation.
To do this, the real estate market needs to be resolved.
Britain will continue to be open, as always, to those who want to live, work and start a family here.
However, it is not right that private individuals living outside the country, as well as companies with foreign interests, should be able to buy real estate as easily as hard-working British citizens.
Dreams of a home have become almost unattainable for too many, and the unworthy state of homelessness has become too unattainable.”
Jack Ross: "My main desire is to be the manager of the Scottish team"
Jack Ross, the coach of Sunderland, said his “highest desire” was to become the manager of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take on the challenge of resurrecting the North-East club, which currently ranks third in the first league, only three points behind the first position.
He moved to the stadium called Stadium of Light after successfully returning St. Mirren's team to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
"Unfortunately, I only managed to get into the reserve," Ross told the Scottish BBC's "Sportsound."
“When I was a child, I watched a lot of the Scottish team play in Hampden with my father, and something always pulled me back to them.
But now the only way I have a chance is to succeed as a club manager.”
His predecessors include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach isn’t worried about following such big names and has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, I’m measuring the success by whether I can get the team back to the first class.
“If you look at the structure and facilities of the club, it’s definitely in the first-class league,” he said.
“It’s not going to be easy to get back, but it’s more than likely that I’ll only consider my activities here a success if we manage to get the club back.”
Ross's managerial career began just three years ago, after a period of deputy coaching at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Aolla recover after the team relegated to the third division, and with St. Mirren on the brink of losing, he won the championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more confident now than ever before in his career as a player, whether at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academic.
“It was a really decisive moment,” he recalled his time as Alloa’s coach.
“I definitely thought management was more for me than being a player.
That sounds weird, because I did a good job, I lived a pretty good life, and I had some really memorable moments.
The lives of players are sometimes tough.
There's a lot to go through every blessed week.
Of course, I still have to cope with the stress and pressure of work, but the management tasks are on me.
I’ve always been interested in management, and now that I’ve tasted it, I feel my best in my adult life.”
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound’s Sunday, September 30, from 12:00 to 13:00 local time on Radio Scotland.
According to one study, beer tastes best at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon
During the summer heatwave, the number of pubs in the UK in difficulty has increased significantly, but restaurant chains are still under great pressure.
According to the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while that of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of CGA, a business consulting firm that compiled the statistics, said: “Due to the sunny season and England’s longer-than-expected World Cup appearance, the previous month’s trend continued in July, when pubs saw revenue growth of 2.8%, with the difference that even greater declines were observed in restaurants.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant revenues in June worsened further in July.
The pubs and bars that sold mostly alcohol performed best, with even greater growth than the dropouts in restaurants.
Pubs that prefer to serve food were also inconveniently affected by the lasting sunshine, though not nearly as dramatic as the operators of restaurants.
People seem to prefer drinking at this time of year.
“Beverage revenues at company-run pubs and bars increased by 6.6% this month and food revenues fell by 3%.”
Paul Newman, a RSM analyst in the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results follow the trend that has emerged since the end of April.
The weather and major community and sporting events continue to be the main revenue factor for the entertainment and hospitality industry.
It’s not surprising that restaurant chains are in a difficult situation, and the 4.8% drop in annual revenue can be particularly painful due to the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant operators, and it will only become clear over time whether the more moderate weather in August will bring relief in this area as well.”
The total revenue growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened locations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing pace of the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK’s hospitality sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is a widely accepted industry benchmark, collects and analyzes the performance data of a group of 47 operators with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion.
One in five children has a social media account that they hide from their parents.
According to a survey, one in five children (even at the age of 11) have a social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta pages” is increasing
The fear of sharing sexual content is increasing
20% of students say they have a “main” account that their parents can see
One in five children (even at the age of 11) creates a social media account that they hide from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta accounts” is growing rapidly, referring to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The fear of sharing sexual content is increasing.
20% of students say they have a spotless “main” account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage profile that said “rape me.”
According to a study by the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), representing directors and directors of Digital Awareness UK and independent schools, 40% of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% admit to having private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t reach them,” HMC chief Mike Buchanan said in a statement.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athletics Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle, Scotland’s most successful athlete, and chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, said that the athlete’s extensive international experience over the past decade will be of invaluable help to the sport’s decision-makers.
“Eilidh is highly respected in Scotland, in the UK and in the international athletic community, and his presence will contribute to the development of Scottish athletics,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am delighted to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can truly help Scottish sports leaders.”
Two of the four Olympic gold medals were won at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics at 200 metres and 400 metres, but he was forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary cerebral circulatory disorder.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that in time it would decide if I would recover at all.
With hard work, but I managed to fully recover, I can walk again, today I am going to agility training!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast sucker advertising that resembles mothers to cows shares the online community
There was a heated online debate about the advertising of a company that produced breast pumps, which compared breastfeeding mothers to milk cows.
Elvie claims to have developed "the world's first quiet wearable breast pump" and advertised their product in an ironic advertisement, reminiscent of music videos, demonstrating the freedom the device gives to mothers who milk their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a straw-filled cowshed, while in the background you hear the lyrics: “Yes, I milk myself, I still don’t have a tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, these aren’t udders, they’re my breasts.”
And the chorus is, "I pump, I pump, I make the kid eat big, I pump, I pump, I milk the girls."
The advertisement on the company’s Facebook page quickly became the subject of online disputes.
The video reached 77,000 views and received hundreds of mixed-received comments. Many say that the advertising mocks the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s very distasteful to advertise the product with cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only when they give birth to offspring, but their calves are taken away from them within days.”
The Elvie breast pump can be placed discreetly in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment read: “Yes, it is terrible for the mother and the calf.
But why not use them to sell breast pumps to mothers who can keep their children?”
Someone else added, “It’s a totally insensitive advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she thought the video was “horribly funny.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have taken it right away if I was still breastfeeding.
I also felt like a cow.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not trying to see it anymore.
The product is brilliant,” he wrote.
Another commenter said: “This is a funny ad for mothers who are milking their milk at work or in a toilet and feel like ‘cows’ because of it.
It is not the milk industry that praises or condemns.”
At the end of the video, women show that they had a discreet breast pump in their bras all the time they were dancing.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women who use breast pumps sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, does not apply wires and tubes, and can be placed discreetly in a nursing bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their baby in their hands, or even move out while sucking their breasts.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s co-owner and communications director, said: “The Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
By pointing out the parallels between women milking their milk and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges involved in using breast pumps and, in a funny way, to show what freedom our breast pump provides in comparison to this.”
It's not the first time Elvie's breast pump has been on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two stepped on the runway wearing Marta Jakubowski’s dress while using the product.
Hundreds of Childhood Migrants Secretly Relocated to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of child migrants detained has reached a record high, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This is partly due to the harsh rhetoric of the Trump administration and its actions so far, making it harder to find welcoming homes for them.
The hosts themselves are typically illegal immigrants and fear that their chances of staying in the country would be jeopardized if they applied to take in the children.
This threat continued to grow in June, when it was announced that parents applying for admission and adults living in the same household with them would have to give fingerprints, and these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted in a statement before Congress last week that dozens of people had been arrested who had applied for the admission of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Eighty percent of those applying for admission and those living in the same household are illegally staying in the country, and a significant number of them are convicted criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to search for such individuals,” Albence said.
In order to speed up the proceedings against children, new rules have been introduced that require some of them to appear in court within one month of detention, instead of the 60 days they have had so far, social workers say.
Many people apply to court via video conferencing instead of appearing in person to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not provide legal protection, the immigrant will be expelled quickly.
In recent months, social workers and workers in the system have reported that the longer the detention lasts, the more nervous and depressed children become, and the chances of violent outbreaks or attempts to escape are increasing.
According to human rights defenders, these risks are only heightened by a larger facility, such as the one in Tornillo, where the number of children makes it harder to filter out those in need of psychological care.
They added that not giving children enough time to prepare or say goodbye to their friends before moving them to such facilities would make them even more traumatized.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupying forces
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the eighth year of civil war in the country.
Moualem, who also held the position of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces had illegally entered Syrian territory citing the fight against terrorism, and that “this is how they will be treated.”
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror will soon end” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been forced to flee their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus was “continuing its sacred struggle to clear the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and “illegal foreign presence.”
2,000 U.S. troops are in Syria, most of them training and advising Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 troops to the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for their return, and that only “some Western countries” were inciting “irrational fears,” deterring refugees from returning home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to assist in the return of the population,” he said.
“They made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and his opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will create a buffer zone around the rebels’ last great citadel, Idlib, could facilitate further negotiations.
The Russo-Turkish deal prevented Russian-backed Syrian government forces from launching a wide-ranging attack on the three-million-strong province.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement set “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would only be directed against jihadists, including the al-Qaeda-linked An-Nusra Front, which “must be rooted out.”
United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of government and opposition delegates will soon be convened to prepare a post-war Syrian constitution and prepare for the elections.
Moualem also called for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, for example, to “revisit certain articles of the current constitution” and warned against any outside interference in the process.
That's why Trump will be re-elected.
Following this logic, Trump will certainly be re-elected in 2020, unless the hopes of many liberal viewers come true and an impeachment or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
We can be sure that this will be “the most dramatic presidential finale of all time.”
For now, the audience is enjoying the show.
Since 2014, CNN has nearly doubled its headline viewing to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly tripled its headline viewing to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, instead of 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is the most watched cable show with an audience of 3.5 million on the evenings of the most important news days.
“We’re attracted to it like fire because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, lead producer of ABC’s drama series “The Designated Survivor.” In this series, a low-ranking minifigure of the cabinet sits in the chair after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell, author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," thinks otherwise.
Here’s how you recall a pre-election Boston taxi ride:
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" asked Scovell.
“Because I’m laughing,” the driver replied.
It's the entertainment of chaos.
Of course, unlike television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like the Roe vs. Wade precedent, whether immigrant families can reunite and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very narrow layer can do so that you do not care about these facts.
It is no longer part of responsible information, however, when we have been staring at a debate show for the sixth hour about the authenticity of the anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward’s book Fear, or Paul Manafort’s <0x24>15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“the arrogance suit of the incarnate, the arrogance suit of Trump,” according to The Washington Post’s S Daniela), or about how he described it.
As far as I'm concerned, that's what I'm going to remember about Super Mario from now on.
“It’s a little bit like watching a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “The Night Stars.”
If you miss one part, you'll miss it immediately.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant 26-degree sunny weather in Kauai, but he was still scurrying around in his house watching MSNBC, recording CNN.
He couldn't break away from television as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee began, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing those crazy shows, many people said it was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought they were joking, but it seems they were right.”

Both parties are pouring money into the toughest races of the mid-term congressional election
No one was surprised that in Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency, both parties are spending innumerable amounts of money after two active MPs are fighting for the same seat after redrawing the congressional districts.
One of the contestants for the recently redrawn Pittsburgh suburban district is Conor Lamb, a Democrat who won a mandate in a mid-term election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a member of the former Pennsylvania Constituency 12, which overlaps significantly with today's District 17.
The map had to be redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former district borders had been manipulated to the advantage of the Republicans.
The Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) were almost bidding on each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name came to be known in Pennsylvania after winning the March midterm election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional constituency in close competition.
For more than a decade, the seat belonged to the Republicans, with Donald Trump winning the district with a 20-point advantage.
According to political experts, Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States has been considering sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China and has withdrawn from the plan.
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama have already sided with Beijing, to which Washington has barely responded.
Donald Trump was in a good mood in June 2017 when he met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization leadership team.
The State Department has recalled senior U.S. staff from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama “for their recent decision not to support Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokeswoman.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid, including in the fight against drugs, development and economic aid.
The proposed punitive measures, such as a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hurt the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As the private meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues to continue a similar meeting last year, with the primary goal of reducing migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
It was announced that Vice-President Mike Pence would also speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which diplomats said was a clear indication of the administration’s importance to the event.
The three U.S. delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not make any statements of condemnation or take any punitive measures.
John Bolton’s White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the dispute, which three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, reported anonymously.
Their reports were also supported by external analysts close to the administration, who were also only willing to speak anonymously.
Historical Experiences
The next blow could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump has obstructed the justice system in any way... and a number of published facts point to this.
Mueller’s investigation also allegedly includes whether Trump’s team has cooperated with Russia, which is trying to influence the election.
If the Democrats get a majority in Congress, they’re probably trying to hold Trump accountable, who may face the verdict of his fellow politicians after the voters.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertainties, and the fall of Trump is far from inevitable... nor is it the case of his European proponents.
Serious decisions must be made on both sides of the Atlantic – it will depend on how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, many German officers were ready to coup Hitler, just waiting for the West to side with the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
There was no support, so it was not possible to prevent the bloodshed in the coming years.
At historical turning points such as this, it is decided that the inevitable development of democracy will be accelerated or slowed down.
In today’s America, we can identify several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s chair has been swinging since last year when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested that conversations with the president be recorded and suggested that Trump was unfit for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times reported inaccurately.
“How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh becomes biased or incomplete and he is appointed a member of the Supreme Court despite a seemingly credible sexual harassment charge?
And the most important question: in the midterm elections, are we voting for a Congress that is ready to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, democracy will face a long winter.
I hope not, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once resided in the building of my ambassadorial home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later asked me to light candles on a table with the sign of a swastika during the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans to play for the Rangers ahead of Rapid Wien
The Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. The victory against the Austrians will ensure their participation in the Europa League Group G after an unexpected draw against Spain’s Villarreal.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to play until 2–2 against Villarreal this season due to a knee injury, but he feels that based on this result, the Rangers can set bolder goals for themselves.
"It was an important point against a great team, Villarreal," said the 31-year-old.
“We believed we could score a point, and we also scored a point.
Maybe we could have scored another goal at the end, but we can't complain about the draw either.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another big European game.
I hope we can get the three points, but it won’t be easy because they were good enough in their last match, but with our fans behind us, we’ll definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was quite difficult, I was hurt, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
We have a good team, the guys are enjoying the game, the training is going well.
I hope that if we do our best, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results.”
Many women worry about not saving enough for old age
The survey participants had a clear idea of what age care they wanted, but only a small number of them talked about it with their family members.
According to a nationwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected cost of their elderly care with their spouses.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually raise the issue,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
The following are worth doing.
First, discuss with your spouse and children: You can’t expect them to take good care of you if they don’t tell you in time what your needs are.
Together with your advisor and family, you can choose where and what care you want; these decisions will have a significant impact on future costs.
Involve a financial adviser: he or she can give you useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can take the form of a traditional old-age insurance policy, or a life insurance combined with a hybrid savings policy, which can cover expenses, or you can use your own assets as collateral... if you have enough resources to do so.
Prepare legal documentation: Thus, the possibility of future litigation is cut off in advance.
Trust a representative, a trusted person, who will act on your behalf in health matters, oversee your medical care, and make sure everything is done according to your expectations, even if you are unable to communicate.
Also, trust someone to manage your finances.
This trusted person will make the necessary financial decisions and take care of the payment of invoices when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the little details: Suppose your elderly parent has been in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Record this data in writing so that they are available at any time.
“It’s not just the financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn’t matter who your doctor is,” Martin added.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything needs to be planned in advance.”
Man repeatedly shot with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun on his way home after his evening program.
The 40-year-old victim was attacked in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, shot in the chest, abdomen, and hands.
The police described the shooting around 2:30 a.m. as a “accidental act.”
Victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed on Friday after a massive earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu.
The region’s communications network was also damaged, so there is no news yet from Donggala Governorate north of Palu, where the 7.5 magnitude earthquake was centered.
More than 16,000 people had to be evacuated.
Some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu, the capital of Central Celebes Province, was built at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Governorate is more than 300 km long on the northwest coast of the island of Celebes.
The governorate, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Central Celebes is primarily characterised by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Celebesz.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Palu and Dongla have been hit by a tsunami on several occasions over the past 100 years.
A 1938 tsunami killed more than 200 residents and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami hit West Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire, which is why earthquakes are frequent.
Just a few of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive sea tremor began on the west coast of the province of Aceh in North Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing a total of 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of the victims killed in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes rocked the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, near Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia’s largest island, and the tsunami that followed it claimed nearly 700 lives on the southern coast.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake devastated Padang, near the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake rocked an island in the Mentawai archipelago near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of about 10 meters in length, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A near-surface quake hit Aceh Pidie Jaya's governorate. The panic and devastation that followed brought back memories of the terrible tsunami of 2004.
The tsunami did not occur this time, but more than 100 people died under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is an Indonesian island popular with tourists; a powerful quake here claimed 500 lives, especially in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings have fallen to the ground, and thousands of tourists have been stranded on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is suspected of committing domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence, and resisting arrest, state police said.
According to the police report, when a lady friend wanted to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took her phone.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Prison, with a <0x24>500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, answering a question about his guilt, saying he was “not guilty at all.”
Palin is charged with three class A offences, meaning he can be sentenced to up to four years in prison and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a class B offense, which can result in a one-day detention and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin's got a lawsuit.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and obstructing the reporting of the crime, as well as possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time claimed that the man had hit him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations for attributing her son’s behavior to post-traumatic stress from her Iraqi service.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people died in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The systems responsible for power and telecommunications have become inoperable, and the number of deaths is likely to increase over the next few days.
The center of the earthquake was near central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are many videos on social media about the arrival of the tsunami.
Hundreds of people gathered at a ceremony on the shore of Palu, when the tsunami reached the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
New York's federal prosecutors have demanded the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the eight-death terrorist attack in New York City, which has not been executed since 1953.
30-year-old Saipov was charged with driving a truck he rented from Home Depot on a bicycle ride on Lower Manhattan’s West Side Highway in October, hitting a number of pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of his victims and "intent" to injure them, according to the New York South District Attorney's Office.
According to the filed documents, proof of either of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 criminal offences, including eight counts of extortion, which until then had been used almost exclusively against organised crime, and the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and premeditated intentions,” prosecutors claim, and Saipov, in their words, carried out the attack in a “terrible, cruel, inhumane” way.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York last asked for the death penalty for a defendant a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The most recent execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been convicted two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogation, he claimed that he was delighted by his actions.
Saipov said the ISIS videos he watched on his phone gave him the idea for the attack, according to the indictment.
Police said he asked for an ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
On all 22 counts, he pleaded innocent.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipov, said he was “clearly disappointed” by the prosecutors’ decision.
"In our opinion, the actual life sentence for confessing would have been more favorable, and the death penalty only prolongs the suffering of all the actors involved in the case," Patton said.
Saipov’s defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty for their protection.
Tory MEP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage said at a rally during the Tory conference that he was “calling the people’s army to fight.”
The former Ukip leader said politicians should feel pressure from Eurosceptics after a partymate of Theresa May suggested that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone, who has no office at all, told attendees at the meeting in Birmingham that the UK would have “exited long ago” if Farage had been Brexit minister.
The pressure on May within the party is well illustrated by the fact that the pro-stay Torys spoke at another anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
May is striving to implement the Chequers Plan, which requires a constant shift between pro-Brexit and pro-remainers and the EU.
Despite the negative reactions, his allies say he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can only choose between his package or “total chaos”.
Bone said at the Solihull Leave Means Leave (“Leaving means leaving”) demonstration that the “Chequers deal” had to be ended.
He suggested that Farage should be included in the House of Lords and that he should be entrusted with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had led the negotiations, we would have left by now," he said.
The wellingborough MP added: “I’m sticking to Brexit, but the Chequers deal has to be ended.”
Criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be the servants of others.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the assumption that the public mood had changed since the 2016 vote: “There is no basis for reality that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a pro-Brexit MP, also attended the meeting and told journalists: “All I ask is that you listen to the voice of the people, Madam Prime Minister.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote for it, party membership is unpopular, especially among the activists who work in the field and helped us get into government.
Forget the Chequers deal and listen to us."
He said: “Only the Prime Minister who keeps his word can keep his seat.”
Farage said politicians should “feel the pressure” not to betray the outcome of the 2016 referendum.
“Trust between us, that is, between the people and our politicians, is now at stake,” he said.
“They want to betray Brexit, and today we are gathered together to send a message that we will not allow them to do so.”
He said: “I would like our politicians who are preparing to betray Brexit to feel the pressure.
“We call on the people’s army to fight for victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have made the UK an independent, independent, proud country again.”
In the meantime, pro-stayers marched in Birmingham and held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Some activists were waving the flag of the “Toryk Against Brexit” movement this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party sneered at the Conservatives because of security flaws in the party’s employment at the opening of the conference.
“These people said they had the IT background for a Canada-plus-plus agreement, a seamless border crossing and a free trade agreement without borders with Ireland,” he added.
- They're just fooling me.
“There is no good Brexit,” he said.
Warren is “deeply considering” running for the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully consider running for the presidency after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at a public forum in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing for a re-election in November against the Republican representative of the state, Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been some speculation that he might be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th public forum meeting with voters since Trump took office.
One participant asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren said the time had come for “women to play a role in Washington in restoring a misplaced government, including taking the highest position.”
A person suspected of shooting Sims at LSU has been arrested.
Louisiana-based Baton Rouge police said Friday they arrested a man suspected of shooting Wayde Sims, a basketball player at LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. East Coast time.
They had previously posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from the gunshot, which proved to be fatal," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson confessed during the interrogation that he was at the scene, that he had a gun in his hand, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was detained at the East Baton Rouge district police station.
The Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 as a beginner, played an average of 17.4 minutes per game, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to the World Championships after winning the race in front of Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
After Valtteri Bottas qualified for a better position on Saturday than Lewis Hamilton, it became immediately clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team would play a major role in the race.
Bottas started well and almost got Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two laps, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
At first, Vettel stood in the boxing alley and let Hamilton get stuck in the traffic behind the midfield, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes came out a lap later, behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a close-knit action, in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside arc free after moving twice as a defense in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back of the dice and finished seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then drove most of the race as he did not change tires to get to the finish quickly and overtake Kimi Räikkönen in hopes of fourth place.
At the end of the 44th lap, Räikkönen was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, and Räikkönen finished fourth.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a gentleman when he was told to let me go.
"The team has done an exceptional job of getting the first two places," Hamilton said.
Her body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday because the senator insisted that she did not leak Christine Blasey’s letter to Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but merely noted that what was going on in the Senate was evidence that people were “disgusting, hateful, and liars.”
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when they see the anger, when they see the people angry, despicable, hateful, and liars,” he said.
“If you look at the statements and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
That wasn't me."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... Did you leak the document? – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t leak.”
Well, hold on a second.
“No, we didn’t leak,” he added, imitating the senator.
A letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and the letter leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s claims and I did not leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to treat him confidentially, and I treated him confidentially as he requested."
However, his denial seems not to have been accepted by the president, who remarked at the meeting on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you what: his body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual harassment by the three women by claiming that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
“They are determined, by any means, to regain power.
You can see the vileness, the abomination, they don’t care who they hurt, they have to go over who they have to go over to get power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars–Belfast Giants 5:3
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in a match against Dundee
With a 5:3 victory in the rematch at Dundee on Saturday, the Dundee Stars avenged their defeat at the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday.
With the help of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants scored a two-goal lead early on.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the home team, and Dwyer regained the Giants leadership.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard made up for Dundee's draw, and Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals.
It was Adam Keefe's third Elite League defeat of the season, beating Dundee 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
The two sides met for the fourth time in the season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal in the fourth minute fell from Kendall McFaull's goal pass at 3:35 p.m., and four minutes later, with the help of David Rutherford, Beauvillier doubled their lead.
In the round-up third, Sullivan brought the home side back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt's Cownie equalized at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants led him to the break when he scored his second goal in the evening at the end of the first trimester.
The home team rearranged their queues, and Bouchard scored again at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen get the lead for Dundee towards the end of the second trimester for the first time in the game, then took care of the victory with his team's fifth goal in the last half of the third.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five games, returned to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller killed to save hundreds of people on the plane from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero who lost his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck Celebes Island on Friday, resulting in a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped beneath the debris in the town of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues had escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the wildly swinging control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pau.
Batik Air Flight 6321, which was already on the runway at the time, remained there for safe take-off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were heartbroken when we heard the news,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could be several thousand, and the country’s disaster relief organization has said the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are difficult to reach.
"The number of victims is expected to continue to increase, as many are trapped under the rubble and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
Waves reaching up to six metres in height destroyed Palu, where mass burials are held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency cars bring new bodies every minute.
There is little clean water.
The shops were looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing against time to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a real tragedy, but it can be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the country’s soldiers: “I ask all of you to work day and night on evacuation-related tasks!
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia has been hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok this year, killing more than 500 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one person is missing in plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which operates a plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, said one person was missing, although it had previously been said that the evacuation of all 47 passengers and crew from the plane had been successful.
According to Air Niugini's press release, the situation on Sunday afternoon shows that a man cannot report a passenger.
The airline said it was collaborating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to additional information about the passenger, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into water while landing at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials on Friday reported that seven people were taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are not yet clear.
According to the airline and the US Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the landing area.
Witnesses say the plane missed the landing area.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's a good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that, along with others, he was able to run through the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to him, the air escorts panicked and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors repairing a quay nearby helped rescue people and took an inflatable boat to the shore before the plane sank 30 meters below the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered airline crashes over the past two decades, but none of them have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented the indictee at a retrial of the man who was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an information analysis expert.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she was killed.
Rowlett said he received location data from several phones that showed he was with Tellis Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when the man said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed to be in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
According to the cell phone records, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers’ death, Tellis had deleted her text messages, phone calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio challenged the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The High Breed in Bristol, hip hop has distanced itself from its roots in dealing with political messages and social problems.
They want to return to these roots and re-populate the conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are once again popular in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York City nurse sues for dismissal of party after "racist" message
A New York City nurse filed a lawsuit against a couple for dismissal on the grounds of discrimination after a mistaken message sent to her complained that they had managed to employ “a black nurse again.”
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
The mother of two, Lynnsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment when she saw the woman black on her first working day when her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, arrived in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEE, I'M STARTING A BLACK!" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
The New York Post reported that Plasco-Flaxman, after realizing his mistake, dismissed Ms. Maurice, claiming that the outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and sent home with an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for reparation for his dismissal and asking for <0x24>350 a day for the six-month residential work for which he was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them how to stop, that’s not possible,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to discontinue Maurice’s employment because they feared they could not trust him after being offended.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even by accident?
Your newborn?
Oh, come on.
According to Plasco, who compared the lawsuit to “extortion,” his wife gave birth to the baby only two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Would anyone attack you like that?”
It’s not very nice to do that,” the investment banker added.
While the legal process is ongoing, the public court has quickly condemned the party on social media, denouncing their behavior and logic.
According to a recently found letter, Paddington publisher feared that readers would not be able to relate to a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine ourselves in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s a lot of fun now that we know what a huge success Paddington is.”
His father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he felt inspired to write a children’s book about a little toy bear, would not have been resentful if his work had been rejected, he added, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was bittersweet after his father’s death last year.
He called Paddington “a very important member of their family,” adding that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he wasn’t arrogant at all,” he said.
“But because Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child who takes him to something: we’re proud of him, even if it’s not really our fault.
I think that's how Paddington's success was seen.
Although he created it and emerged from his imagination, he always attributed success to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her over the phone.
At the landing, his daughter and he were rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought for his life in vain.
“They called me regularly to tell me that he was in very bad shape and that they didn’t expect him to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received a call from Nad saying that in the next two minutes my daughter will die and I have to say goodbye to her.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating slowly ran out and then left his body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
All I had to do was sit there and wait for it to be over.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn’t leave myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the others who had not cared about the ordeal she was going through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I bowed my head and my tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on that plane, I felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That she needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much.”
Postcard with grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards full of inspiring messages and emergency numbers on a bridge in Wales.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when she became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day,” he said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, told me that her son was a promising cook and that his smile was on everyone.
“He knew everyone’s smile.
They always said that her smile would make any place brighter.”
However, before his death, he gave up his job because he was in “very poor condition.”
Tyler, who ended his life by his own hands, was found by his then 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, “I was constantly worried that this would trigger some kind of domino effect.”
Ms. David made the postcards “to let people know that there are people who can be contacted and talked to, even if they are just a friend.
Don’t sit quietly – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who for years had lost Ms. Davies' girlfriend, Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or depressed or anything,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely depressed on Christmas Day: when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t look into their eyes and all that.”
He said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to deal with it: “He left a huge gap in the family.
He broke our hearts into small pieces.
But we have to keep fighting.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could achieve what he asked for -- a limited-time, limited-scale investigation -- maybe we could come to an agreement," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee feared it would "fall to pieces" due to the party's indecision.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI investigation?
Their resistance can only be attributed to the timing.
The mid-term election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans are not expected to perform well, it will be much harder for them to get their men to go to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support for Mr. Bush, who worked for the White House, and through him he also met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases your report?
The Senate currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get the minimum 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make the decision to inaugurate Mr. Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
North Korean Dissidents 'Decreased' Under Kim
The number of North Korean dissidents heading to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengszok quoted data from the Southern Unification Ministry and said there had been 1,127 dissidents in the last year compared to 2011 when that number was 2,706.
Park said closer border surveillance between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not commented on this information publicly.
The majority of the northern dissidents will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most people flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China welcomes dissidents as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often sends them back forcibly.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still practically at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, focusing on the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came with a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they broadly agreed on further cooperation on a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
However, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho on Saturday blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the American people, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances it is unthinkable that we should unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "unfit for the Supreme Court".
House Minority President Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and claimed his behavior was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"It occurred to me unintentionally that if a woman behaved like this at any time, I would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said in a statement to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh protested emotionally against rumors that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost yelling, and his voice closed when he talked about his family and his high school years.
In addition, he explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him a “grotesque and coordinated character assassination,” organised by angry liberals because of Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s behavior proved he was not fit to work for the Supreme Court because he showed he was biased towards Democrats.
“I think he has ruled himself out with his statements and his attitude toward the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if he would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable if he held the position and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
“All I’m saying is that if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you’re not just fit for the Supreme Court, you’re not fit for the court you’re in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Capital Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, as Kavanugh is considered a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would change the Supreme Court's rulings.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical, biased person to become a member of the court, and he expects us to fly with joy,” Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It's a legitimate outburst, rage that's been building up for months and years, and it can't come out without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that rare, right?”
She told me that she also cried in anger, but she developed a technique according to which, when she started crying in anger, she said to her interlocutor: “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
But I am angry.”
And then he just kept going.
And I thought that was a great idea.”
Tears are sometimes overlooked as a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the most vivid memories I have of an early job in a male-dominated office where I once cried in my angry inertia when an older woman – a cool manager I’ve always feared – grabbed me by the neck and took me out to the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” he told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they’ve managed to upset you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on her presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage affair on Monkey Business and was eliminated from the competition, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came to the conclusion that there was no reason why he could not run for the presidency on his own.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me, laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they wanted another candidate in the middle of their back.
Someone called him “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the campaign has been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder has been lagging behind in raising money, so she has vowed not to enter the race unless she raises the <0x24>2 million.
It was a battle to lose.
He realized that some of his supporters gave the men <0x24>1,000, but he only got <0x24>250.
“Did you think I was getting a discount?” he thought.
When he held a press conference saying he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude for the people who supported him, and frustration and rage over the system that made it difficult for him to raise money and reach voters directly, that his throat was squeezed.
“They must have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted.
“They thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to write on my tombstone.
“Crying?”
How can the U.S.-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening of the trade war between the US and China was almost deafening, and while the battle is still not nearly over, experts say the break-up between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warnings earlier this year by imposing taxes on China’s most important exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, as the new tariffs are already affecting a product worth <0x24>200 billion, effectively taxing half of the goods going from China to the US.
In all cases, Beijing retaliated, most recently imposing tariffs of between 5% and 10% on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has vowed to fight back every time, and the world’s second-largest economy will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you want to get Washington to back down, that would mean you have to give in to the demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Chin-ping, the president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing is tactful, U.S. trade war pressure could benefit China in the long run by reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision, whether in Washington or Beijing, could create conditions that could turn any of the economies of both countries into an economic vortex is much more serious than has previously been admitted by observers,” Abigail Grace, an Asian research assistant at the think tank New American Security, said in a statement.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready to return the refugees voluntarily and asks for help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem said the country’s conditions were improving.
“The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who had to flee between terrorism and arbitrary economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war broke out in 2011.
A further six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Moallem said the Syrian government would welcome any assistance to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team by 16.5:10.5 against Le Gold National outside of Paris.
The United States has failed for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its title as Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star who struggled throughout the tournament, dropped his shot in the water at hole 16 par-3, handing Francesco Molinari the victory.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all circles, making him one of the four players who had ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the European team’s lowest-ranked player, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that I got the cup back.
It’s all about the team and I’m happy to be able to help,” he said after Garcia’s victory in Europe.
The baton is handed over to Jon Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in the 2&1 singles on Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods and growing up watching this man,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 main titles, and who is only preceded by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing result, “He’s proud of these guys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
Great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping our team, and we're working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to raise your hats too.
The opponent was better than us.”
