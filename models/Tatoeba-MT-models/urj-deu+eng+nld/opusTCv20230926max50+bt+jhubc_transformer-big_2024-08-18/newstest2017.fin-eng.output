28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
A 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a staircase at a local shopping mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he doesn’t know anyone who wants to hurt him, and says, “His business finally went well.”
The body, found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, a San Francisco coroner’s office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was a homicide and that an investigation was ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line cook in Boston, had gotten his dream job as a line cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "horrified and shocked" by his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and we will miss him very much," the spokesperson said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank initially stayed in hostels, but that recently "his affairs finally went well".
"He found an apartment and was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to cook for us, to make dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any dispute.
He was the brother who drifted with the stream.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a rough diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information on the matter will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline at 415-575-4444.
Physician Trainees Strike: Demands for new industrial action
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their trade unions to approve new industrial action in their dispute over the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) asks the whole Council to support new industrial action from the beginning of September.
JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the deal.
In July, medical trainees and medical students voted to reject an agreement with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of the votes cast.
In a letter to members on Thursday night via Twitter, Ellen McCourt, JDC president, said the government had remained "perseveringly silent" about the issues that, she said, led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC government has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and demand formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to give mandate to the progressive and expanding industrial action programme that will begin early in September.
As a result of the controversy, medical interns have participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete job shutdown in the history of the NHS health care system.
Dr. Johann Malawia, director of BMA’s medical interns, resigned after the vote had rejected the terms of the agreement, recommended by the BMA.
He had told BMA members in meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical trainees and students that the agreement was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be prescribed to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: a coalition of outsiders?
It ended in a crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and formally declare the eight-month-long struggle for words and economic sanctions to be over.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
Yes, it was a handshake.
But Putin’s smile looked forced, and he didn’t exude much warmth, even according to his own subdued standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, kept talking about his "dear friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
I lost count.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to a better one.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was horrific.
Putin attacked Ankara, accusing it of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media led an astonishing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious allegations were made by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade from ISIS-controlled areas in Syria.
He has emphatically denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia has won a victory.
The benefits of a severe ceasefire are clear.
Firstly, Mr Erdogan needs all his possible friends after he was almost ousted in last month's failed coup d'état.
The ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which typically carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when the flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late-season raid on the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the importation of agricultural products from Turkey is again allowed.
"You went there, the tomatoes back here," as the newspaper Vedemosti put it.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, people are angry with the West about what is considered a weak response to an attempted coup d'état.
Adding to this a long-standing resentment over the snail-paced EU membership negotiations, Putin comes forward, eager to take advantage of the coolness and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader was guaranteed loose points from Ankara, where he called after a revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is obvious to Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in the magnificent seaside palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present a "outside consortium", as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
However, the two have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently aligned itself with the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It may be much to say that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus as to where they can look for a common ground with regard to Syria.
After months of open hostilities, and given the possibility of a total disaster with a NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian fighter plane, it is certainly better for the two leaders to at least be in talks again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s international goals.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued, it has abandoned these goals.
During this time, bank strategists have used the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland operates with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except for HQ and stock exchange listings will be converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that will gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a customer and staff tour in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will become our investor brand and the employer of our employees, because we will now become a much more branded bank.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to move in the direction of a brand bank, because basically (we’ve been asking) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focused on the needs of our customers, not ours, I think you’ll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins Newmarket with Predilection and achieves 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after winning a double victory with a total of 3,000 wins
Race rider Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached a milestone in the evening with his second victory on his home run, competing in a Prediction coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
Three-time master jockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayjar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened at Newmarket, because here I started 30 years ago.
It’s not a big event, it’s not a Royal Ascot, it’s a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori absorbs cheers as he lures the Predilection out after a victory.
Two racers have reached this milestone in obstacle racing - master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racers of the present era, and it’s no surprise that she has reached this milestone that few have achieved before her.
She's classy and strong, but her tactical wit sets her apart from the rest of the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have been attracting fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he weren’t just a weekend and big race jockey!
Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a vivid person who is a good thing for British competition, but besides that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a branded drone landing from the saddle.
From drone stops to drone landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
He scored a pile of victories in the big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and was banned from racing because of drugs.
Three years ago, he had a hard time coming back after six months of no-competition, but he showed significant character strength in challenging the sceptics and returning in his best condition.
And he might go on for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue racing until he is at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin removes Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has sacked Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said Putin had "ordered Ivanov to step down as the head of the Russian presidential administration", but no reason was given.
Ivanov's deputy director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
She was born in Tallinn, Estonia in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later led the president's protocol and government staff, according to the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State when it comes to drafting laws and managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that the persecution be appointed in his place.
Are your smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, served as the Soviet security service in the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on state television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, only a few people here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this just the aftermath of a power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with great scepticism.
In comments quoted on the Kremlin's website to Putin, Ivanov said, "It is true that early in 2012, in a debate, I asked you to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, if not laborious, task.
Well, now I've been chief of staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov accepted the position in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as Putin’s third term would have been unconstitutional.
This task, however, went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Last month, Gibson was involved in a physical dispute at the show’s location in Los Angeles.
The series' producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson, apologized Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and quarrels.
I regret that it happened,” he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson’s character will be removed from the FBI team series are to be expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg sitcom, has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it everything I can for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the show can have.
The 12th season of the series is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery fish landed in the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help in identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be wind turtles left behind by a turbulence.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, published film footage of the apparition on Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossing with the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four locks between the "decks" that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Finance Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section.”
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, finishing the lock between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation, in which extreme precise dimensions must match.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete deck of the last part of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck had been installed and connected to the expanding north pole road deck, we had to close the remaining section from the north, that is, from the inland side.
This was done by dragging the land bridge of the Northern Passage 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Huge, because of the 222-metre length of the land bridge, it weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of about 3%.
Demanding, because the permissible deviations according to which the team worked were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are “lucky to be alive”
The three men are “lucky to be alive” after falling from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station issued an alert at 13.20 a.m. (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the incident developing in Moelfre Bay.
The three men tried desperately to swim to safety while their boat continued on by itself.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the helmsman of Moelfre's lifeboat.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got on the move," he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, and a third 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
The men were taken to the rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely undamaged.
The engine of the boat had a life-switching rope, but it had somehow become detached from the person who was driving the boat when the boat fell.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a venerable hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and take part in some activities.
The display time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now, more recently, smartphones.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to a fad called Pokémon Go, an application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later developed into a series of cartoons, playing cards and other sequels).
Like many phenomena in pop culture, its popularity had somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon, which are tracked by GPS, and after being found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot of the phone) or "captured".
The generation that played the game at a younger age has joined in the hype and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the “average person”.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent of users tracked by Cardiogram.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees training level data.
Many public health campaigns’ calls to “find 30,” “get up from the couch,” and “be active every day” have yielded no results because most public health warnings are boring and cared about by people who look unhappy.
The importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
People who move regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too varied to list here.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, deplorable cheerleaders look for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
Well, what about it?
There's been a breakthrough.
While there were previously apps like Fitbit that could track activity, they didn’t give a reason to move like this game.
The charm of novelty disappears and use will fade in time.
However, because of Pokémon’s success, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunters to be more active, in better shape, and healthier.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Energetic in jumps.
Smooth on the boom.
Incredible on the floor.
Brilliant everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the multiplayer championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
His overall score, 62.198, was clearly better than that of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win the multiplayer championship in a row, and the fifth American champion in a row, while at the same time consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
He burst into tears when his final score was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement puts him in the same category with other top athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken his sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold, with programs that have been so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
The last test awaited in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of over-expectations.
Returning home to Texas without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
U.S. Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman will hug after winning a gold and silver medal (in this order) in the women’s gymnastics multiplayer finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won his first medal on Tuesday, culminating in the opening ceremony of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought about the future as he traveled his long way to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, which includes his trademark volt head, has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also be great on the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and found by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother while on a study trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching, has become a forceful force.
He hasn’t lost in a multiplayer match since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak will probably continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina was in the small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and permanto, in which Biles is the dominant world champion, waited.
He climbed to the top with 15,433 boom points and surpassed them with 15,933 perms.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the final points—a mere formality—and the tears rose into the glitter red, white, and blue eyes of Biles when the dream of which he once wrote in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a kind of revanch from four years ago, when he was in a shared third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafa in the replay.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call “grandmother,” was clearly in the lead.
He sent air kisses to the public after his permanto performance, in an emotional rush to return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
When it comes to Biles, this 19-year-old’s widespread tweet from this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl, who died in the deadliest attack on the first serial killer in Phoenix in the last decade, were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to a police statement released Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the driveway on June 12.
A gunman on the passenger’s side fired a handgun up to eight times and escaped in another vehicle.
According to police, the triple murder did not appear to be the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the <0x24>2,900 that the other adult victim had.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sgt. Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to investigate whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
Seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American neighborhoods in the past four months.
"These are happening in a residential area in front of the home," Howard told KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers have refused to disclose the evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were related and were made by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries, where she later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
Witnesses told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also released a police bulletin about the shooting, which took place just half an hour before the triple murder, aimed at a vacant convertible, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The researchers found bullet casings, a bullet in the seat, and fragments of the bullet in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund is petty-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
“When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn’t do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not at all true - of course I did," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that she be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was, 'I didn't know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walking stand.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth will show you how Edmund's inventions sign "sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it’s not an ordinary sign language – he tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different causes: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or the Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What will happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven’t asked for a prediction in a long time because I don’t expect anyone to be able to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
Things are getting easier.
You can believe it's gonna get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana caused the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded their perches and caused a widespread flooding threat due to extreme rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities, and that help is already coming to needy districts.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office for Security and Emergency Preparedness, said they were receiving requests for tidal vehicles, boats, and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipaho County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The Flood Watch will remain in place until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that three to five more inches of rain are expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was in place on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana, and were predicted to set a record for the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there is a threat of flooding the Ascension County downstream as flooding rivers slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.
South of the Mississippi state border, the Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at its highest level ever at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers are still picking up people from floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
62-year-old Hansford says the water in Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
She says that another stepson living nearby warned her.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It stretched all the way to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she had never seen the water of a stream so high in the 48 years she had lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members were all injured and that he was the only swimmer.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued the trio in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloster Fire Station, where the rescued stayed overnight on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods will "spread rapidly" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Mr Krautmann said that the country was completely saturated by the heavy rain that had continued since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of residents of Tangipaho County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, reported that a member of the City Council said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
The county chairman, Robby Miller, said authorities had rescued 72 people and 7 pets who had been blocked by the tide.
The cities of Amite and Hammond have opened shelters for those who have been evacuated.
"They can go back to their homes when the water starts to go down," he said.
In the town of Hammond, in Tangipahoa County, about twenty streets were closed because of the tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try and keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood here was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said the steady rain continued along the Gulf Coast.
He said Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded, but so far on Friday there have been no reports of flooding.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still raining."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which is the second time a six-year-old has been shot in the city this week.
His grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds in the groin, leg, hand and stomach, among others, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recorded as critical and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was about to start first grade in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car, along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
The researchers told CBS Philadelphia that it looks like there was a crossfire between several shooters.
The attack gun-type shells, which originated from different types of attack guns, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant battle.
There were shells on both sides of the street.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and they were in active combat," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and according to the information received, the police are investigating the surveillance camera tapes.
Another six-year-old girl was hit by a stray bullet on Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
So I’m calling this year’s women’s olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First of all, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly: this team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Hispanic women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected yet masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win an individual gold medal in a women’s multiplayer game.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We can see the top of the sport, but the situation does not look like this in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because there will only be four gymnasts in the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is Marta Karoly's final year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts practice, as a rule, in private gymnastics clubs run by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts, as well as families), and the list goes on.
Many of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighbourhoods that can support the sport.
At these clubs, gymnasts receive all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for gymnast families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez coach, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to communities where many young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 young people in the city (mainly blacks and Latinos) and we have coached national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline and determination.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health, as well as school and work success.
This team inspiration will get thousands of young girls to start gymnastics, and that’s great.
Participating in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girlpower" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from all backgrounds to start on the road to a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Medical interns to organize new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the controversy by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 medical trainees who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the pact, saying the NHS was "on unknown ground," and that even minor additional delays would harm staff and patients.
The first doctor trainees will be transferred to a new contract that includes changes to nighttime and weekend work habits to improve care during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Physician Interns, said in a statement last night: “Physician Interns still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it will accelerate the existing labor crisis and that it will not treat all doctors equally.”
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Attempts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced a reluctance on the part of the government and, at times, a deep silence.
That’s despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the sanction, and take into account the concerns of medical interns.
If he does not do so, the medical trainees will be ready to continue the industrial action.
The latest strike at the end of April resulted in nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments being postponed, as nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to replace doctors on strike.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 medical trainees under contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical interns not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a challenging situation, and cause worry, anxiety, and disruption to patients, caregivers, and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hopeful that the ongoing positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbatical leave, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave, and gender pay gap in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, the Education England Education Organization and the Ministry of Health are about respecting the agreements reached with the November, February and May BMA.
Two pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day of medication after authorities recommended giving it to people for longer.
The anti-coagulant drug, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for as long as 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NICE, the NHS’s supervisor, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people have a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them have a second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the artery wall, which forms stenosis.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can travel with the blood and break the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure are at an increased risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
A draft NICE guideline published today recommends that humans be given 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE’s Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: “Despite the availability of effective prophylactic treatments, up to a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later have a second heart attack or stroke, with often devastating consequences.”
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective at reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With the initial recommendation of ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the number of treatment options available to several thousand people who may benefit from them.
Due to limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular with regard to the risk of bleeding, over a period of more than 3 years, treatment beyond this period is not recommended in the draft guideline.
A culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year due to corruption, prompting a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the disregard of widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities, a shocking government report reveals today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles is urging police, election watchdogs and city councils to ignore evidence of election fraud due to “racial and religious sensitivities.”
A former community secretary, the current anti-corruption emperor, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to put guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present an identity card when voting to prove who they are.
Nowadays, all the voters have to say is their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on the finger of a voter so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for greater access for the press to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working parties.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would also protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government ordered a report following the Tower Hamlets vote scandal in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ruled that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The court said Rahman had “cynically distorted” the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were questionable, or the result of a person voting by pretending to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern about electoral fraud in postal voting, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made a number of recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including proof of identity with an identity card
"Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
“There were concerns that...the institutions of the state had ignored such behavior because of the ‘politically correct’ sensitivities associated with race and religion.”
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists handling postal ballots in order to put an end to 'voting'.
The report, which Theresa May is reviewing, also calls for tougher checks on registrations to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for verifying the identity of voters before voting.
Use indelible ink on the finger of the voter so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to make sure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prevent political activists from dealing with ready-made postal voices and envelopes in which voices are sent.
Let the police set guards around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography in polling stations illegal.
Require only English to be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that the voter must go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric slays the Greater London Police Department, saying that it is “astonishing” that no criminal charges have been filed since the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The election court will stay with Lutfur Rahman and his officials as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegality," he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds, without a doubt, according to the threshold of criminal evidence.
He also criticised the ineffective “tick-in checks” in the voting registration offices of city councils.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as the birthplace of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy for Kate's bicycling twin and other celebrity photos at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have gone crazy about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be an impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of his own famous double being - at least, according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the American male archery team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s biking double, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be a star, Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after his photos surfaced, where he appears to be frighteningly similar to the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, becoming aware of the social media rush, the archer admitted that he had heard from childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see much of a resemblance, except maybe with a beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will surely come out again this year: the startling resemblance between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina’s big, expressive eyes are said to be the twin of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear for the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of the actor Inception
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more to do with actress Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blond hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of the "sporty version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Tough Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others saw the similarities too
Presenting the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between the similarities of a pair
A Twitter user on the site recently expressed his happiness that “others on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the American football star and Dexter's actress really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as Gabby Douglas, a gold medal-winning gymnast whose own, beautifully wide smile matches the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologises for saying Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of Ai Yanhan’s 4x200 m freestyle message on Wednesday angered viewers of CBC’s live Olympics broadcast.
The Canadian television company CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said during the race, a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "disappeared like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig."
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started sharing some of his own opinions in the women’s 4x200 m freestyle message final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC commentary team to bring "color," was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China blew it, baby.
Too eager, gone like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to capture China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did a CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer ‘died like a pig’????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
China's Ai Yanhan was portrayed in the women's freestyle 4 x 200 m relay finals as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China fucked up, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was strong and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold themselves back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wau <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group. <0x23>disgusting."
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologised in a live broadcast for MacDonald’s comment, saying: “We regret that the comment about the swimming performance was broadcast.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this has happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Colleague Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and attached an apology to over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The TV company quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent live.
We took prompt action last night and apologised live to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Mr Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised in a live broadcast and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer, not him as a person."
Needless to say, I didn’t mean it as disrespectful, and I’m really sorry.”
Primark customer dismayed by a woman who rudely matched lingerie in the middle of a shop
Customers didn’t know where to look when she took off in the middle of Primark’s shop to try on underwear.
Things were not improved by the fact that after assessing what she looked like in her trousers, she peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually arranged for four pairs of underwear in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman wore underwear and then put it back on the shelf
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, said that after trying on lingerie, the mysterious woman “went out of the store again and walked away without buying anything.”
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of underpants, took off her own pantyhose and underwear, and put on her fitting feet.
"He didn't even try to find a secluded place for atonement, he just stood there shamelessly."
"Everyone was staring at him, as he took off his underwear and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn’t like anything he saw, got dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting."
Davidson, a 33-year-old from Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn’t cleaned.”
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the garments after the woman left, which is fine.”
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and they haven't been washed."
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident at the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from sale.”
How to Defend Against Armed Attacks Using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Krav Maga Federation grandmaster Rhon Mizrach in New York to find out how to deal with gun-swinging robbers at close range.
Whether you’re approaching from the front or the back, this video shows you how to pay the attacker at the same rate.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, you must first turn so that you can see your attacker and "raise the line of fire".
You then grab a gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue hitting the knee in the groin, and when the attacker goes in pain, twist the gun from his hands, hit him with the gun on the back of his face, and back away, keeping the gun pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal will not be able to fire.
At the same time, put pressure on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point the gun at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not the grandmaster of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtyest places for a travel guide
A British traveler has placed a serious challenge on his immune system and his vomit reflex by licking some of Europe’s filthiest and filthiest places.
Ian Wright, 51, a presenter and travel writer from Suffolk, licked a euro banknote, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a toilet flush button on a train, and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to be in.
However, the experiment, which was made into a film called The Traces of Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright was constantly talking to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, none of his arrows left him anything else with a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known as a tester of his intestinal endurance as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, stretching from public railroad railings to the flush button of the toilet seat, really tested his immune system.
In the film, he said, “Since I was a child, I’ve been pretty carefree about my health, and I’ve put all sorts of things in my mouth, starting with dirt, worms, and dirty water.”
He confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample had a photometer reading of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the count of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced the traveller in the footsteps of the film, Inner Power, together with the Finnish dairy Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the bathroom."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's snotty in here.
On the trail of inner strength was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help boost human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of Snacks, Juice and New Categories at Valio, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at and that would at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'let's call Ian'."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we can tell more about it to consumers in an interesting way.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the documentary, added: “Let’s say this: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, such as the stinking Russian toilet in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him.”
Understandably, some of the licking was easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks recorded."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents specifically linked lactic acid bacteria to stomach and intestinal well-being, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products with lactic acid bacteria.
Family destroys apartment building in Saltash, Cornwall, before eviction
The <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 damage to their rented house was caused by a family after they were evicted from terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after being complained about several times.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing company officials found the property in poor condition.
There had been gaping holes in the walls, the floorboards had been torn, the waste had been spread on the floor and the walls had been stained with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere and is believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said she feared the property could not be repaired.
He said, “This has been a nightmare for the residents, and I don’t think people should have to live this way.
There are a lot of things to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through Cornwall’s less comfortable groups.
This family is notorious, and their name is notorious.”
The couple had three sons who sometimes lived in the property, and police said the family’s tyranny included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive shouting, quarrelling, and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, received a decision on anti-social behavior.
In many rooms of the house under threat of demolition, old garbage was found.
The floorboards of the property, which had previously been used to transport drugs, had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street and the police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted a woman and her partner from their property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move.
Relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become one hell.
Someone said, "They didn't care about anybody."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here an unbelievable number of times.
“This morning we couldn’t sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It's wonderful, now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property
Trash and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rented house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own conduct and that of his family, as eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions must have terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the brave community members who have informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that the three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
Dirty mattress left on one bedroom floor after eviction
Residential workers now need to clean up the waste stacks around the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of cannabis, a scale, supplies, and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for admitting guilty to possession of a Class B drug with the intention of distributing it.
He claimed the money was intended for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner are living homeless after now staying in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the rooms in the house were decorated with graffiti.
Police say they are trying to evict residents who are mocking the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police Department said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message for those who think that their behavior is without consequences, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
The police in Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior. The police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are horrified when a military jet flew ashore at a low altitude
Sun-worshipping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experience the shock of their lives
Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion aircraft swept past from very low ground
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At this very moment, horrified tourists began to panic as a low-flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came close to touching sun worshippers on a sandy strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up as they understandably began to worry about the noise from the jet plane, though they did not at first see what was coming to them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the numerous holidaymakers who posted videos of a dramatic bypass on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, “It passed twice really low, and at one point it looked like it was about to crash.”
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it really felt like a plane was crashing on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared from the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to inspect the boats.
He said the jet had flown much lower than usual because of the poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby fires, but the Air Force assured him that no one’s safety was at risk.
This summer, wildfires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly at low visibility due to the conditions, the smoke from the fires and the thick fog.
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats
Eksote's first half of the year results better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made a better result than planned in January - June by EUR 3.4 million.
Eksote's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has made it possible to dismantle institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the action queues.
The exote covers a previously created deficit with a surplus.
What is left over may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Eksote Board will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border guards have sworn a military oath in Immola
The 70 officers of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military casting ceremony for the guards of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The tenth special border striker course was held at the garrison’s sports field.
A 70-year-old soldier was sworn in.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border management, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special border guards.
250 of them were invited to the exams.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces during the war were involved in the veteran meeting.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
A bit of robbery ahead - criminal intelligence helps in the investigation of crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has had a criminal intelligence and analysis unit (RTA).
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
In the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by a sergeant stationed in the Bay.
The Chief of Staff is the Inspector in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
They all work in civilian clothes.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
It has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to make it less common for the police to go to the swamps only when they receive an alarm.
With the help of information collected and analysed by the unit, day-to-day police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, with less than three national units and a separate criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR centre, which operates in connection with the Central Crime Police in Vantaa, manages its operations nationwide.
According to their name, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Inquiry extends beyond your own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is the task of the RTA unit to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one’s own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, an alert task database and observations, the unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
A handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method, a certain image of the author is formed.
Serialization can be done either on the basis of the method of the act or on the basis of the person, depending on which of the police has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not completely public.
The methods used by both criminals and themselves are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities in order to prevent police efforts to combat crime.
The police will announce the methods publicly if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the way in which empty dwellings were marked, which was reported in early summer, in apartment burglaries.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin, or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were really traveling.
The preliminary investigation material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest people order the minutes of the district court, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, the thieves go with their gloves on.
Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppää from the Häme Police Department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärve from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department have been interviewed for the case.
The police collect and analyze information that is used to plan practical activities.
Against the background of the decrease in labour and financial volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was a three-step reform of PORA, which ended at the end of 2013.
National co-operation gathers information from outside the borders of the institution and Finland.
ISIS-affiliated schoolgirl killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is reported to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the girl’s family heard that she had died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the organization’s base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, died while planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and testament to others, that there are real risks involved in going to war zones — that it could make people stop making such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and that she had become a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton considers Garland a candidate for the Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have been blocking Garland’s confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect a person to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a teleconference on Thursday that he predicted "some sort of certainty" that Clinton would elect Garland.
Reid’s spokesman later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton’s team would not want to “swing the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland’s nomination were “handlangers” and “facilitators” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as for men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar for 2017 inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude pictures is different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks there's a calendar for them.
"We need to start showing timeless and classic nudity again, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of naked female bodies," Shaw said in a statement.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can submit images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush to fill the comment section with irritated insults by the author of the nickname NoAllSingleMen of Middle Ages, please note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed new release is not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but rather about the longing for middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl record are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely to buy records are those in the 18-24 age group.
It’s also not just a matter of collecting enthusiasts, it’s also emotional: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov’s results correct?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would sign vigorously before stopping, form a cup from my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's look into it more closely."
Let's look at this more closely.
At the same time as Soho's charm and dirt are slowly being removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, and office supplies stores now fill buildings that used to have independent shops - a handful of stunning specialized record stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while while standing very close to different men in some of these stores trying to assess their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in the twenties), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and tours shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (he sent the sample by email, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason he acquired such a huge number of records and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: now he can buy records he couldn’t afford when they were originally released, and he can repurchase those he sold when he was young and broke.
"Most of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records released when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds, “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my vice."
25-year-old Wez, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been affected by the enthusiasm of the media, people who have heard that the albums are back in fashion and who need to buy back their old albums.
Based on the conversations I have had, people have usually gotten rid of their collections in 1998 or 1999.
“Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records back,” he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakened at a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores provide a comforting community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar album covers; objects that evoke memories of teenage happy days.
“I think sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that owning things creates,” Wez says.
As a collector, I also admit that this is true, and I believe that it is true for many people.
It’s an easy way to fill your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee said suddenly from the pile of plates.
The April ICM poll revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyls do not have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably seem seriously concerned about browsing the bossa nova collections stack.
This “prize” aspect of awakening is something that has also been noticed by Jonny, 42, who works in the Sounds of the Universe (the counter: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a big deal, but it is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We get people who say, "I don't have a record player."
It’s not the older people, but the younger people, the late-teens, who are just getting excited about it.
Foppi, which now has almost a whole floor reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - the speakers are fresh with Wild Beast's latest synth and sex-filled pop, and not improvisation jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes, watching different albums on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so collecting records isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music on the computer or something else, but the beauty of vinyl is...” she sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have sparked a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I’m trying to look like I’m looking at jeans shorts, I’m observing a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a while before my father and daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, essential records from any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is purely “art vinyl”.
But considering that even a little attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soho caves to get more, there’s not much to complain about here.
It comes as no surprise that the part of the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in Soho’s record stores, they don’t rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday mornings sniffing around Berwick Street record stores, browsing records, and avoiding the creepy, 30-year-old fake TV presenter’s gaze as he peers over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest-lived vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the holker has a longer lifespan than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied sharks, says that the record is set for a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five meters long.
French court rejects request to dismantle Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a request by Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or tea for 50 cents (40 cents), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent an unpaid parallel economy and because they pose a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that the free meals offered by the state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free meals to those who need them.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the eviction of the people running the 72 temporary shops, but said that the concern of the prefect of Calais was "completely understandable."
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants had a much greater role to play than just feeding people "who live in extremely precarious conditions".
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, a non-profit operation that provides 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect a children's café.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure of the café would be “a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
The two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 — a peak — since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall significantly faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are drastically lowering to the delight of consumers and to the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries the price of food fell by 0.9 per cent on average.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food has fallen the second most in Finland in those EU countries that have the same wage level as Finland.
In comparison, only in the UK the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article by Statistics Finland’s Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then came a turnaround, after which food has become cheaper every year.
The price is now weighed down by Russia’s bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” says Lehtinen.
Intensified price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as a spectacular advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not a place of cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food in Finland was the fourth most expensive of the EU countries, which had a wage level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the comparator countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the same level as the old EU countries when it comes to food prices, we need to halve VAT to the EU average and continue to compete on prices," Lehtinen writes.
Mr Lehtinen points out that his calculations of the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
When you return to school, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced in all primary schools at the beginning of the semester.
This is the rule that all schools in Finland operate.
The details are decided by the schools themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New guidelines have been being prepared for several years, and they differ from the old ones in many ways.
For example, learning to write fiction will be abandoned, and instead, coding will be practiced in schools.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social studies begins at the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
In the past, it was thought that a teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make schooling more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found: Ice shark can live up to 400 years
At least the known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until he is 150 years old.
It may live for another 250 years, according to a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrates in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, only the Icelandic clam, whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507 years old, bypasses it.
Greenland sharks swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch longer than the males, they can grow up to more than five meters long.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to the surveys, only about a centimeter per year, adult individuals have been forcibly living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon timing of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-inch amazone mammals, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that glacial females only reach sexual maturity when they are more than four metres in length, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at this stage.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann is fired to nearly 300 – no sales cuts
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the troubled company ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs will be cut, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of retailers will not be reduced so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, some 80 employees of the support functions are offered new jobs as a salesperson.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
When they started, the need for reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The aim of the demographic reduction is to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised in the course of next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme that aims to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in making the department store profitable are behind this.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store transaction is still making losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Managing Director of Stockmann, the sales in the department stores have not reached the targets set by the company.
"Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure a positive operating result for Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The result improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best-ever second-quarter net sales and results.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group had a loss of EUR 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales this year will decline from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather on a rainy Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona L<0xC3><0xA1>ng.
There will also be rain showers in the central parts of the country, but there will be troughs to the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees.
Kenya athletics team is shaken by doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's rap
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah performed as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The athlete that Anzrah tried to play is the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Kenya national team leader Stephen Arap Soi said Anzrah’s identity had been revealed after he had given a sample as Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials reported to the Anzrah authorities.
Anzrah was sent home “for committing a crime against the Kenyan national team.”
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kenyan Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino told Reuters.
The Olympic athletics starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is one of Rio’s favourite winners.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah travelled with the athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officers confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him to a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he feared they would be exposed,” the source said.
Where's everybody?
Rio’s athletics stadium is empty
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio to watch athletics.
The competition for athletic medals started in Rio on Friday, but the world’s top athletes were able to show off their skills to a confusingly empty spectator.
Rio organizers said Friday that only 58 percent of the first-day morning and 65 percent of the evening tickets had been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was buzzing with cheerleading crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The loss of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
Thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding, for example.
When Brazilian medallists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the grandstand was full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only about 30 per cent of the 12,000 seats were filled.
The bad sales are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is far away for European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not able to complete the stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the organisers, said that 82% of tickets had been sold at the time, a much lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost nearly half as much as those in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio, this has not yet been allowed because the organizers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for lesser-known sports such as golf and rugby.
Rio Stadium was full of empty seats in the morning.
Not even the beach volleyball on the Copacaban sand has interested the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private individuals, companies and entities can use the money to claim ownership rights in the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of ownership for a fee.
The holder will have the right to veto its 187 square meter block, which means that in practice, not every holder will need approval if the use of the land is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
Acquisition of the right of domination is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or a gift.
You don’t have to go carrying banners or shackle yourself somewhere to protect nature,” Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired control of his company, explains.
The owner of the block receives precise location information from the block, which makes it possible, for example, to visit the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of the holders of the rights appear on the same map where the land block information can be found.
Leviäkangas sees the risk of its procurement of nature conservation as only that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation was established as a non-profit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation would operate in some way unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be left untouched and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of proprietors' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims beyond Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square from 13 to 19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turku the most in big cities - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torture Turku the most in Finland’s big cities.
This year, more bicycles have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the other nine major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat determined, based on the reported bike thefts, how many bicycles and bicycle parts per thousand inhabitants were stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police, there were four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
That's a big difference.
"In some cities, there are double the number of thefts relative to the number of inhabitants," says Police Inspector Tommi Reen of the Police Board.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is very difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The prevalence of thefts can be affected by how much people move around the city on wheels and how many bikes there are," says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in the comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts depends largely on the number of study and cycling towns.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and lots of bikes for thieves.
"Estonia, for example, is a completely different type of city, where city centres are far from each other and a bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, slightly fewer bike thefts have been reported to the police in January-August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police report slightly more than 20,000 bike thefts each year.
That means 50-60 fillers every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They're big," Reen says.
In reality, thieves steal more bikes, as only a part of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a crime report for bike theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are discovered.
A typical solved bike theft is one in which the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in the blood.
"Cases are also discovered in connection with other investigations, for example, when a drug case may contain stolen bikes in an apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or during a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from bicycle racks, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars in shopping centres, i.e. virtually everywhere they are normally stored.
As in previous years, most of the individual bike models are stolen from Jopo.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
For example, some thieves take a bike for short-term use, but a large proportion of the stolen bikes end up for sale, for example, via the internet.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the attention of the police that stolen bikes go abroad very much," Reen said.
According to police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a concealment crime or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if a good bike is sold at a clearly lower price," Reen says.
Special library clerk Severi Hirvi always carries his colourful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He's had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, says Moose. "He's never been taken, he's been a good monk in that regard."
"Perhaps this isn't so attractive to thieves, it doesn't necessarily have hipster value," Hirvi says.
Siiri Valve, who had a quick visit to a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike nodded against the wall of the kiosk, but Valve usually locks its bike in something solid, such as a bicycle rack.
"It's going to be a lot of thought, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about her white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
“You keep hearing from your friends that bikes have been stolen.”
"Mostly bad bikes, such smurf-Jops."
A bicycle was stolen from the house owner a year ago.
However, the bike was unlocked, so Valve was waiting to seize it.
Under 15-year-olds to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki to test US-famous peer-to-peer wrestling crews
In Helsinki, a so-called peer-to-peer jury is being tested to prevent young people from becoming involved in a criminal spiral.
Initially, the experiment will apply to children under 15 years of age, who will now be exempt from criminal liability.
The jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the perpetrator and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator can join a peer-to-peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Youth Executive Director Tommi Laitio says the model is not strict.
We have other conciliation models that are used side by side.
“Everything is directed towards a more responsible way for a young person so that not everything is ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
The peer-to-peer team has taken a model from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young person does not face an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with people of about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, service designer at the service design agency Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault, which was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes committed by people under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It has been a message that you should continue on the path you chose," Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, backed by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to all those in need, not just immigrant young people.
More than 70 Republican Influencers Want Party to Stop Funding Trump Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter calling on the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, which had received a sketch of it.
The letter is addressed to President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to be channelled into congressional elections instead of Trump’s campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his negligence, incompetence and record-breaking dislike threaten to bring a wave of vote to the Democrats in this election," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are declining day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from “people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress” and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials said in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton pledges relief for U.S. families with children
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced details of her economic policy on Thursday.
I am running for president so that the U.S. economy is doing well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy will go well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a statement.
At the heart of the Clinton Plan is a massive <0x24>275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure — roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a handshake for the American Dunarits, who are suffering as factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We are the builder people, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to ease the situation of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he insisted that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States to become a tax fugitive, it will have to pay departure tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the free trade agreement in the Pacific, which he previously supported.
"As President, I am opposed to any trade deal that works against workers or wages," Clinton said.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program that Republican Donald Trump announced on Monday that it “favors only this kind of millionaires.”
Trump’s proposed cut in corporate taxes, Clinton has previously called Trump “a loophole.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded audiences of small business owners whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
These are Rio’s ratings: The competitions have not glued the Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions appear as sharp mountain peaks in TV viewing statistics.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached huge numbers of spectators.
At one time, the games have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens at best: on Tuesday evening, the swimming was followed by 615,000 viewers from Yle’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparison: the European Championships in athletics one month ago attracted almost 800,000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships attracted well over a million viewers.
The most interesting Olympic sports so far have been cycling on Sunday evening and gymnastics that opened the fifth day of the competition, both of which reached almost half a million spectators at a time.
Sports manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the number of spectators and reminds that for the first time at the Rio Olympics, spectators will be divided into several instruments.
In addition to television, Finns are watching the Olympics in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the proportion of TV viewers who choose the Olympics in general.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympic Games in Rio are the first sports competition to which Yle has dedicated a whole channel.
When it comes 24 hours a day, and there are 20,000 to 500,000 viewers all the time, that’s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s broadcasts come to Finland at night.
Another reason for the weak interest - if anyone considers it to be weak - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the opening competition, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other sports of Finnish interest: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When athletics starts, the ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the Games on the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I guess we're already about 200,000 chargers.
"We will not get the network's ratings until later," Pokkinen says.
The Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the defects have been corrected.
The use of the Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been received, which should correct the errors.
The Olympic Games in Rio appear on Yle’s canals and in the arena more extensively than any other sporting event ever before.
You can watch some sports on the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Speech broadcasts competitions every day.
The Olympic Games are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only from Yle’s channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports will be shown on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which is 95.3 metres deep in Risinselkä.
It might be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found about 20 square meters of deflection in Ristiselkä, the depth of which was shown by the dive computer to be 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by echo-probeing.
The method does not necessarily find a small recess in a hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Lake Saimaa, Lake Toisvesi and Lake Pääjärvi reach more than 80 metres.
They haven't been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been accurately mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela wonders.
If the deepest lake is determined by the average depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
When viewed this way, Päijänne does not reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the top.
Correction 12 August at 14:29: The last paragraph where the deepest lakes were wrong was corrected.
Ihalainen on tax cuts: Taxes on pensioners still tighter
Taxes on pensioners are still tighter than those on employees.
Ihalainen says that the complaint was raised in the run-up to the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal with that of wage and salary earners.
The government’s proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises given should be kept after the elections, he says to Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received reductions in their income, which reduced taxation.
The matter was warmed up in Parliament by opposition representatives, who cheered the then Finance Minister Alexander Stubb on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, in the policy on tax reductions presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Econ.), it is mainly a question of safeguarding purchasing power rather than increasing it, as next year wages will not be raised.
He says tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s insecurity.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages from Prime Minister Juha Sipilä and Orpo about their willingness to honour the hard-won competitiveness agreement.
He says that keeping to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be undermined by questioning.
This will be necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people’s own belief in the future.
Prolonged Unemployment on the Barrier
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget debate, at least to stop its growth.
There were approximately 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in attacks in Thailand
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finnish time.
The embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and avoid the most busy tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the embassy for caution, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish Thailand travel season dates to the turn of the year.
The vast majority of tourists from Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finnish residents in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to get information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador thinks that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand’s divided society and last week’s referendum on a military junta constitution.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, an ethnic-national conflict over the Muslim population is brewing, Westphalen said.
Muslims want more self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks will affect the course of the day so that the authorities will be very careful about security.
Thai police say attacks are not about international terrorism
According to police, the attacks are “local sabotage” and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police said.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand in 24 hours after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including in tourist-loved Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded at night on a holiday island in Phuket, which is also popular among Finnish tourists, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was wounded.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded in Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination.
At least one person was killed in both double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and the city of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists, as it is used to travel to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the Thai military junta, said the attackers were not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic any more, he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators had intended to destroy the country’s tourism because all the attacks had taken place in tourist areas.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the large dispatch office for caution,” Westphalen says.
Vulnerable Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the Finnish night and the victims.
We have received a bit more information about last night’s attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the second attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
Surat Thani's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the provincial governor.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
The police chief, who was interviewed by CNN, said that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Thani, which detonated every half an hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quarter-final
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for scaffolding titles in Rio with platform, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to the best of his ability over the last few years.
He has won eight personal world championships in the previous three seasons.
He has won the quarter-final and permanto championships three times in a row, and last year and the year before.
In the U.S. team, Biles has won two World Championships.
The lighter World Cup medals Biles has a jump and a boom.
Thai entrepreneur: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency and a children’s play club in Phuket, Thailand, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don’t think that this will result in anything more amazing,” Huovila, who has been working as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years, says.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies near Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then there was a bird flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If they haven’t expelled tourists, this is hardly the case.
The Huovila company’s office is located a few hundred meters away from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about 9 a.m. local time and said that it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere in Patong was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
On the beach, many had never even heard of the attacks.
At half past three o’clock in the day, traffic in Patong had normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila, who visited the site, says.
The car was later seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
The patrol found two men with symbols hiding in a nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately arrested.
One ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of motor vehicle theft, theft and serious harm.
The police thanked those who gave the clues.
Research Director on Russia’s leadership change: Clearly set aside
Russia’s highest-ranking change in leadership in years was made on Friday, when President Vladimir Putin sacked the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomat and worked as Ivanov's second man.
“The reason for Ivanov’s expulsion may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that the recycling of leadership roles is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov may have had trouble with other leaders or may have screwed up.
Station drop at Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s inner circle, will take on special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer and proposed to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
In Russia, environmental and transport issues are not very high on the agenda.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but was elected president by Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guards, such as governors, have recently been exchanged in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place that Putin changes his immediate circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters use civilians as human shield in Syria
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them,” said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were deployed in hundreds of cars in which they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish militants seized about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to IS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we erroneously reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, ISIS fighters abducted civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: Ministry of the Interior’s document publicity policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office and the fact that the information had been recorded in the minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry’s Communications Director tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt has been running against time.
He was injured in the early season and had to skip the Olympics in Jamaica.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
“I’ve been practicing well and that’s the key,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and fan-turned journalists.
Porina around Bolt underlines the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the 2004 Summer Olympics was in Athens, where he was eliminated in the 200-meter increments at a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, shattering the world record and competitor self-confidence in the time of 9.69.
It's harder.
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the peak of his career by measuring the clock.
The world records of 9.58 metres and 19.19 metres in Berlin are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-metre world record and a 19-second record, but no one believes in it except Bolt himself.
One of Bolt’s biggest challenges is Justin Gatlin, the Olympic champion of 2004.
In the Beijing World Cup final last year, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt hasn’t lost a single time in the finals, if he’s ever made it.
In Daegu, Bolt missed the <0x24>100 World Cup final in 2011 due to a fraudulent start.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He's an old man in the young men's league, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year’s World Cup in London as his final goal.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But whenever I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
Chinese state news agency Xinhua said Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, had given a positive doping test at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping test found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping test on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the epo hormone.
She finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100m butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has filed his doping case with the International Court of Appeals for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua says evidence of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide was found in a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday.
There are also other suspected doping incidents in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the hormone epo.
Kenya has sent an athletics coach home from Rio for doping.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete and had given a doping test for him.
According to media reports, it is the Kenyan runner John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-meter Ferguson Rotich race pass.
There's nothing to stop Phelps - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam his 22nd Olympic victory in a 200-metre men's tournament in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold in the same sport in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps's winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second before Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, the BBC's Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton is laughing in the evening magazine's quick interview.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t stress much if there’s a little noise on social media or in the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he said.
Skelton wears high-heeled shoes and a short dress that is sure to have at least enough revealingness - at least for the eyes of many conservative British spectators.
There are no hindsights, however.
It's important to look good, and small arguments are just a funny thing.
Skelton is sure to want to frighten you, and maybe even startle you, but he insists he doesn’t want to be in the lead.
It’s not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn’t matter how I dress.
Can you imagine the turmoil reaching all the way to Finland?
I can’t, but all that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay with me, Skelton grinning.
You know what, man?
It's a fuss from nothing, if it comes from dressing up (the presenter).
I'm a little amused if this one hits someone's radar.
Rio Police Arrested Two Due to Terrorist Suspects
The Rio Police Department said on Thursday it had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The police arrested him during the security inspections.
At the same time, police arrested five others and questioned two people before they were released.
All the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that police arrested in July.
The detainees are believed to have links to ISIS.
The detainees were reported to have incited violence on social media.
Violent messages had been circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police detonate a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first-team game in the empty hall of the Rio basketball tournament on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed it to the public.
The police let the public in after they had detonated the package in a controlled manner.
This is the third time since the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled blast mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public was allowed to enter after the police had detonated the package in a controlled manner.
The audience did not make it to the auditorium by the start of the match, as the police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police detonated the package and let the public into the hall only after that.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that started the race sleepily.
With two defeats, Spain defeated Nigeria with 96-87.
In the last two races, Spain won silver.
The police carried out a controlled detonation mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last Saturday, police had to blow up a suspicious find near the road cycling finish.
Spain and Nigeria started their first-team matches of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty spectators.
Argentine lady slaps Petäjä-Siren - Finn reflects on protest
Wind Petäjä-Sireni had a colorful race day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a hard time on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady kissed Tuuli Petäjä-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening of the women’s surfing day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He got stuck in a car accident, and the others escaped, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete had long considered protesting.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund,” Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
After the crash, the Finn was ranked 27th.
The London 2012 Olympic silver medallist is the eighth overall.
The car accident did not have much effect.
Friday is an important day, when we have race departures from 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Unusual Things That Scientifically Extend Your Life
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to add years to a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life gets longer.
Sometimes, things that a person has no control over can add years to his life.
These include, for example, a predisposition to core obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don’t always have to worry, just picking up a can of milk is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored through various studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all of these things can lead to more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “reduced risk of death,” especially from neurological or cardiac diseases.
Studies have shown that moderate consumption -- from one to three daily doses -- can prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who didn’t drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can prolong a person’s life by more than six years, according to one study.
This claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can also contribute to the spread of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected a person’s lifespan.
The project, which lasted seven years, was monitored by more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years in his life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings additional years, there is no denying that.
However, reaching longevity does not require unconditional solidity.
A study from the University of Oxford found that women with a big butt had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it’s an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bun.
Many studies have attempted to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his or her life.
On the other hand, some researchers suspect that longevity is due to a person's social status - which in turn makes it possible to pursue recognitions such as the Nobel Prize, for example.
A study of the shopping behaviour of people over 65 found that people who shop daily are less likely to live as parents who shop.
This is because rotating in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may precipitate death.
So count your credit card from your hand - online shopping will not have the same effect.
Drunk driver crashed into truck
On Friday evening, a serious frontal collision between a truck and a passenger car took place in Kotke, Southwest Finland.
The accident occurred in the middle of Koskikentie and Sorvastonttie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when the passenger car on the way had run into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck stood upright in its lane, but caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The car fell into the ditch and then over the ditch onto the roof.
A woman, born in 1972, who was driving a car, was squeezed into her car.
Rescue services removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to the Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The woman's breath test score was 2.02 promille.
He's suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Posti sends candy to the wrong city
There were deficiencies in Salon K-Citymarket’s selection of bulk candies, because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the cargo to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was shopping for candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in the loose chocolates, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the cargo delivered!
Unless there was traffic in the lawn, the sign said.
The merchant’s foxing sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
Lawn mowing is available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
I was shocked by the popularity of the update.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention that has been drawn to this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favourites in a candy bag, even though a few larvae were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for Posti’s Corporate Transport Services business, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages went to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we did not go to make a partial delivery (Saloon) with three, but we only took five stages today,” Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomi.
This was first reported in the evening.
Teija Haltia was not angry with the sign, because she found all her own candy favourites in the selection.
Thirty pounds lighter Lotta Backlund posted a photo of her change
The comedian-producer has shrunk dozens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a life change.
Lotta shared a photo of her change on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aiming for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian and television producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss project in 2009.
He has a comprehensive lifestyle change and has slowly lost about thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of photos of his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund’s before and after photo pair has collected a number of praiseworthy comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous, aren't you?
We’re on the same road, motivation is strong!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I travel the same way, another says.
In the spring, Lotta lost the last few pounds with the Let's Do It Now project.
At the time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally reach the normal weight, which was then ten kilograms away.
During the three-month period of fitness, the pounds eventually dropped to five.
The family wish of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Commemoration of the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered with a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and petitions.
Sipoo Veterinary Hospital has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked as a substitute at the veterinary clinic in Sipoo and also completed her nursing training there.
The vet remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous, and unafraid of work.
Dear friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbors told the newspaper that the victim was very fond of animals.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old suspect did not know the woman and had no connection.
The murderer was tracked down by police dog Börje, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Posti for violating the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise a temporary agency worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court ruled in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the withheld salary and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only a part of the instructor’s salary that corresponded to the share of the instructor’s work throughout the day.
According to the District Court, the employee was placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the decision of the Union of Postal and Logistics Industries PAU on the induction ban.
During the November Postal Strike last year, PAU made a decision that Posti employees would not familiarise themselves with temporary agency workers who violate the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalist Association.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Federation of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concerns about freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland has repeatedly highlighted to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
Putin sacked the head of his administration in place of the Estonian-born Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has sacked Sergei Ivanov, the head of the presidential administration, the Kremlin said.
Anton Vaino, grandson of the Communist leader of Soviet Estonia, Karl Vaino, will replace him.
He is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax said.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to the Kremlin's press release, Ivanov, a close-knit insider of Putin, will take on special tasks related to the environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a second assignment and suggested that the persecution be replaced, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB's espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to office in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's big buyout for ban - won't be seen in Premier League opening
The world record holder of football transfers is not seen on the field when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba was banned from playing in England.
Manchester United’s Paul Pogba is on the sidelines due to a ban on the opening of ManU’s league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
According to British media, ManU paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million for Pogba to Italian club Juventus.
However, the FA Football Association of England keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was under a ban from Juventus.
He received two warnings at last season’s Italian Cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
The ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next match will be in the league's second round on August 19, when ManU faces Southampton.
In Flow, greatness is a virtue.
Strict criteria and ambitious visions of enjoyment have established Flow Festival as an internationally respected event starring the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival goers have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival’s event area is decorated with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to just have a main stage and a beer tent,” says Artistic Director Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The question behind this success is simple: what kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It is quite different in the event production to think this way.
The goal is often to reach the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities,” says Artistic Director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 people by 5,000 last year.
This year, the festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because the activity has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle guided by huge passageways.
That's not what we want.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been swelled with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant and drink bars in the partially artificial grassed area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, a tent for 15,000 people will serve as a venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little magnificent, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work that has been done is that today even big visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki’s support of approximately 20,000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the company operating Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "cruise-like things", such as the construction of the 73-metre-wide tent.
Visitors to Flow have typically expressed themselves in distinctive clothing.
Alongside the music event, one can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event is not consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and a desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival, which combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's done damn good gigs in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flowerpots - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Since 1989, wildlife protector Edwin Wiek from Asia tweeted an eloquent picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the TV properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Shortly after that, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was also popular among Finns.
No one reportedly died.
At the same time, there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken a heated interest in the activities of criminal organisations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new preparedness forces will first go to battle in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are ordered to combat duties only after several months of swearing a military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the chief of training of the Finnish Defence Forces, who was interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are capable of fighting, for example, of conscripts serving 5.5 months in a war situation.
According to the Head of Training, first reservists will be assigned to the reservists.
No conscript or reservist is assigned to a task for which the required training has not been provided, Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer, it became clear that the Finnish Defence Forces would start training conscripts for the immediate readiness units starting next year.
Units may, if necessary, be used in military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola receives huge compensation from a mould house
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over an apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330,000.
However, after the transaction, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, which caused microbial vegetation that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in dismantling condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in court and in the court of appeal.
The court ruled on the matter on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the district court, which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 in price reductions.
In addition, the seller has to reimburse the couple’s litigation and settlement costs totalling EUR 47,344.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly, because the buyers had already known about the need to repair the apartment at the time of the purchase.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the defects in the construction were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a good home because they did not want to do the repairs.
He had come to the impression that the building had been renovated and in good condition, and that there was no harm from the elements mentioned in the condition check report.
The inspection report mentioned the risks and malfunctions of ventilation and the inadequate management of rainwater and meltwater flowing along the rock surface.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that there was any urgency.
Tola and Waroma maintained the idea that rainwater coming from the cliffs should perhaps be controlled a bit within a few years.
The transaction took place in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial vegetation in the building, which, according to witnesses, was caused by both rocky rainwater and capillary soil moisture.
On the western side of the house, the inspector estimated that the air contaminated by microbes could also enter indoors through the porch.
Mold or yeast exceeding the limit values, which poses a health risk, was found in brush samples in the utility room, the basement staircase, the windowsill in the living room and the washroom in the basement.
Terraces were built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been enlarged in violation of the building permit.
The court ruled that before the sale, Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision that changes had been made to the apartment contrary to the permit.
Among other things, terraces had been built, even though there were no proper permits yet.
However, home problems were a central issue in the court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma had no particular reason, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, to carry out a wider inspection than usual.
The buyers have not neglected their duty to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - also Finns on the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter that the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., has microfilmed records of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards are from the National Bureau of Breeding in Nazi Germany.
The National Board of Breeds operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of women, who were supposed to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were undergoing gynecological examinations to find out.
The National Board of Racial Affairs investigated women’s backgrounds by, among other things, examining church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to renounce their Swedish citizenship and give handwritten biographies and good recommendations from close relatives to the National Board of Breeding.
The racial agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving," "smart," and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The case does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program stipulated, among other things, that every SS man should have four children, either married or out of wedlock.
The Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the US Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and supporting children.
A German mother’s Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, according to the museum's website.
Sixth in Petäjä-Siren, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first race of Finnjollie’s day at the Olympic Games in Rio, but remained the top of the team’s tail in the second race of the day.
In the overall situation, he rose to eighth after five departures, but his failure to finish second dropped him to 14th place.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren took 17th and 3rd place in the RS:X class.
In total, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In 470, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the opening round.
In total, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: “I was so stunned”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite Finnish artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who has grown from the bartender of the cruise ship to the tango king of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dance stages and festivals, continues to thrive, and is currently in a state of extreme agitation.
Jari Sillanpää, a book by Mari Koppinen about the life of a favorite singer, was published today.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career rose to an absolute high when he won the crown of the Tango King at Seinäjoki Tangomarket in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a slightly different kind of music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The song Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape with a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so fucked up!
Sillanpää remembers in the book.
You wouldn’t immediately guess from recording a song that became a huge hit that was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the print was still good.
I learned that you don’t have to demand perfection and excellence all the time.
The second incident related to one of the most popular songs of the man, described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with his partner at the time, and the case eventually ended up in the lyrics for the song You Deserve Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record telling the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the separation were not true, instead it was written based on the news from 7 days magazine.
The newspaper reported that Jari and his ex-lover broke up because of Jari’s excessive partying and alcohol use, but Jari said it was complete nonsense and it wasn’t true.
Jari was furious with the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their empire out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the divorce and 48% would have stayed in the Union, even though polls during the voting week predict the opposite.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the separation, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of former U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid," flew to the ground in a UK Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics asks professionals for answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economists’ explanations for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's the right British.
Many people also have the impression that a decline in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist Party, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly struck by the BBC’s fairness, which allowed just a few percent of the economists in favour of the EU divergence as much room as the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested in explaining what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic capital letters think about the consequences of the split.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt, and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not think they have a common interest.
The academics of the big cities, like the economists, would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and in rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is an Economy
The overwhelming argument for victory in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant congests your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments work.
There are foreign workers in every cafeteria.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get doctors if they didn’t exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the children of the real British to get a place at school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners in every town.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer waiting lists for health centers and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK's public finances, and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepares for Brexit in Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, in Aberdeen, preparations for Brexit were made in time by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, more detailed preparations were made for Plan B, the victory of the EU-leaved camp, in case the result was a leave.
There was concern that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We're going to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says about Aberdeen’s only daily open-ended real estate fund that the news covered.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
At the time, the fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at or below 10%.
So the real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed the trade.
When the EU-leaning camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they robbed the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good situation because of the cash raised, but it also had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worth pulling out the money in a panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you don’t have to take your money out now, it’s not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and the majority withdrew the notification.
Since then it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in the Aberdeen Continental European Funds.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closures of real estate funds received unreasonable attention.
The open funds affected by the closures control about 4% of UK real estate.
The Aberdeen closure lasted six days and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its funds closed for the 2017 half of the year.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts are downgraded, but the situation does not seem "worse" for Aberdeen.
The main questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound/dollar exchange rate is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of buyers, he said.
Brexit brings down on London property market
At two o’clock in the morning, the situation didn’t look very good.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments at the UK’s Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word in your head.
I realized that this is now going to plan B,” Vanhanen says in her second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
The city of London was still alive in the morning.
The TV screens in the office, which were normally set to be silent, frustrated the news, and usually the noisy crowd quieted when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell them he was different.
When the market opened, the screens flashed only red.
It was a morning you never thought you could live, he said.
Not because Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, which is why the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit Vote Begins Correction
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership switched.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the UK real estate market, especially in London.
London office spaces were projected to have up to 20% downsides in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trades one after the other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not show its last summer holidays on the face of Vanhanen, who was in Helsinki this week.
It is too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference will occur and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first reported.
CBRE's data on price developments cover about a third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 percent from June to July.
In the City of London office buildings, a negative figure of 6.1 per cent was accumulated, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only in five months there have been worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All the same drops occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared to the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
Mr Vanhanen thinks that the comparison is not entirely appropriate, as this is a domestic crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different too.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like this at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is found normally.
The repair could have been done anyway.
In fact, he doesn’t think the price adjustment is a miracle – it could have happened without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that property prices in London and other top cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City and especially the offices are overpriced, Vanhanen says.
The fall started really high.
London’s prices have risen for four reasons, according to Vanhanen.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of property that is becoming globalized, Vanhanen says.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for profits in new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, price rises stabilised last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net salesman last year.
There was a turnaround, and now it came.
What about from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not dare to judge much of the future, but says that there is hardly any chance of a surge.
The atmosphere indicates that there is a descending or steady going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that you can work through the pits.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much of a victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S-Group starts registering purchase information more accurately than before
S Group knows what you are eating, as the retail group today announced that it will start collecting more accurate information about its loyal customers’ purchases.
When information on the total amount of the receipt has been collected so far, the group will begin to collect it at the beginning of May also from purchased products.
S Group will follow Kesko here, as data on the goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years already.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing purposes subject to consent.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomi.
According to him, Kesko will not react to the change in the registration of the S Group.
Kesko categorises its loyal customers into ten groups according to their grocery purchases alone.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and is not currently planned to do so.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Loyalty Program, which can be joined at Valintatalo, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product group level information, we remain at the level of the total receipt.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on which day and the total amount of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to the same level as K-Group or S-Group,” says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty program is planned to be renewed in the future, but the local store will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially an experiment
SOK’s customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic data also include the profession, education, form of residence, as well as the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the payment method are recorded from the S-Etukortti purchase.
In addition, the data of S-bonus partners have been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In S-markets, Prismo, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains, however, the data are recorded at product group level.
For a long time now, customers have had hopes that marketing could be targeted more closely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Ownership and Partnerships.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
They may object to the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored on the cash registers anyway, whether you like it or not.
The interested party can check their stored data on the S Group website.
For example, cash registers cannot access information, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs’ newest dog reinforcement – puppy becomes first explosive dog
A black labrador puppy sniffs vigorously at five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t be long before it sits resolutely next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing with his favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of gunpowder gas-smelling shells was discovered.
Gunpowder gas is the first odour that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Tull’s first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be assigned to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may take Heila and Sunti to other border crossings and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be the main place of work for Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures at Customs, and after the attacks, supervision has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
Another main reason for training a weapons and explosives dog for Customs’ tasks is the postal consignments passing through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increase in internet sales, up to 40 million mail items pass through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made about 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapons components, ammunition and explosives, as well as their precursors, among online purchases, luggage of passenger planes and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the hound, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio and Heila are also training with experts from the police and the Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport include Customs’ six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include flickering and hunting, as well as calmness, because the dog is involved in weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntie’s home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without a snail at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle commands go to Heila from a one-time lap.
The cameraman in the Evening Messages loses the camera mic cover for the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-looking cam cover immediately after the "delete" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still some proficiency tests ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding jobs.
You can see Heila on assignments at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes as planned.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron a dog wearing a work vest, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten years, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, ranging from eight to ten hours, but active work sessions only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a fierce competition for working dogs in Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied to become the owner of Heila.
Lucky hit Sunti, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and surveillance tasks in Tull.
Mini-state wins its first Olympic medal – people get a day off
Fiji’s Olympic gold in rugby, with a population of less than one million, is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
Fiji's public broadcaster said the Fiji government confirmed the case after the championship was settled.
The day off is the day after the team returns home.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country watched the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen was set up at the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheering," Maikele Seru, a Fiji Times reporter, told The Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish Buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kg after a tough fight.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted several times.
No one really knows why.
In Rio, Tokola was pushed to 175 kilograms and swept to 145 kilograms.
His total weight was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get his last push of 175 kilograms, as did his second.
At the third attempt, the weights rose, accompanied by a fierce roar.
The body was shaking under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The joy of the Finnish lifter was accompanied by the fact that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian forward Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Football Club has signed a long-term contract with the Estonian forward Albert Prosa until the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player with power and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through more than 50 players from all over the world with more than 10 player agents.
Little by little, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored 51 goals in 109 games.
He also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to accompany RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where Rovaniemi residents will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season’s Country King Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The gorgeous Modern Family star once again shouts: teenage star's shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, known as Alex Dunphy in the comedy series Modern Family, shows off her gorgeous body once again.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that leave little to the imagination.
Shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his buttocks.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behavior considerably bolder.
The star has posed in very few outfits in her social media photos and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce clothes.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has also recently posted several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
She has learned that the more she looks naked, the more publicity and attention she gets in Hollywood, Palmer told Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when she was only 11.
The actor has outraged some of his long-time fans with his image change.
“It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years’ time when the downturn is already so strong,” one woman on Winter’s Instagram post said.
Some of the women’s fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her to ignore criticism.
You look great!
It doesn't matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, glows a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the northern lights: in autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to entice the Japanese to start their Northern Lights journeys already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter travels, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
There is great demand for winter Northern Lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season begins early in the autumn and continues until late spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, in which the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the sight twice as fairytale, says Anne Lind, Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see clearer unique sights from Finland, and the Northern Lights have enormous potential here, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>183 a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver with Fid’s masterclass leading to gold
Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed to Fiji's last challenge in the Thursday night final, when the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji organized a masterclass in handling, biting, dodging, support, running lines and sheer strength, winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
With the defeat came a reasonable consolation from the silver medal - the third of the British Day - and they could be proud of their hard work in the Olympic Rugby kickoff tournament, where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the semi-final of the same day, a hard 7-5 win over South Africa could have bothered them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won even a top-five team in this condition.
The fact that at least one Brit will be wearing a gold medal tomorrow: Fid’s head coach is Ben Ryan, England’s former boss from Wimbledon.
The trip to Great Britain has been quite a journey.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This spanking hurts, but the progress is astonishing.
Fidi started out excellently repelling the British tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was like they were running towards moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the finish line at the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right led to a goal kick.
12-0, and the UK had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped male-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring his third goal, but it was just a slowdown for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored a goal in the right corner, and the UK was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored another goal for a new start, and there was still more than a minute left in the watch...first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvouou plunged through the loose tackles of Great Britain and rushed to the line to score a goal.
After the pause, the score was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the UK was just learning the game.
And that's actually what it is.
During the break, the UK made a series of changes that blocked the Fid dam... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored after Fid’s impressive assist.
Dan Norton scored a goal for the UK in the left corner of the touchdown, narrowing the score to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea islanders, whose supporters were singing, waving flags and dancing in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fid’s cheerful approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute paint had a frosting in Fidi's cake, which didn't need frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the Fidians hugged, and Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan in the semi-final 20-5, and the UK defeated South Africa in the tight semi-final where they both scored one goal - the British goal kick was the game's solution.
Kyle Brown took the lead in South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with dazzling footwork and scored under the goalposts in the second half.
A great late tackle by Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15-side rugby team Anthony, secured the victory and eventually the silver medal.
Coach’s battle against cancer wins rowing victory for Helen Glover and Heather Stanning
There will be no gold in these races that is more emotional than that, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 rough strokes toward history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they rowed alone, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was present all the time as the two raced for their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in a women's duel - the first women in the history of British sports to achieve such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance invincible, which is also a record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes joining the surface with swan charm, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every rowing gold is a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually promote the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, after being diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was scarce.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and they performed surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It changes your mindset a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start her treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside the season, when they caused as little disturbance as possible - if that expression could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the win, Williams was the first person to think of who had had a nervous morning, and he had talked a little more than usual trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said: “I’ve been in an emotional wreckage this week, which may be a little overreacting, but this means so much to me.”
It just underscores how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
“Without Robin, we would be nothing, so he deserves a big thank you, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t imagine a better coach or coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the race in five years.
The couple set a tough rhythm that their rivals couldn't reach.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in store.
We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is very important to keep control.
We had a good start and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for a good row and win the race, and that's what we did.
The couple will wait a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will be attending a wedding next month when she marries Steve Backshall.
Right now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
That would have put too much pressure.
After London it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland to change government plagued by Panama leaks
Iceland is holding an early parliamentary election in October, which was demanded by protesters raged by the Panama leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians evaded taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election day is now set for October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the rage of the people last spring will affect the election result in the autumn.
In the June presidential elections, criticism of those in power was clearly shown, and Gudni Johannesson, a non-political candidate, was elected president.
Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled his last speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would also be involved in the founding of the organization.
The Democratic Party was furious and demanded an apology from Trump.
“Nobody should ever be allowed to go down so low as a commander-in-chief,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the Muslim-favored use of a burkini swimsuit on beaches, according to the British newspaper The Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that it is forbidden to go to the beaches and swim for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which broadly expresses religious ties, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice after a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two ISIS-affiliated men attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest who was over 80 years old.
The quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed a sieve - Pyykösjärvi bluish algae clouding
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only at the Pyykösjärvi beach has blue-green algae decay been observed.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environment Department took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu Region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters were below the action limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococcus concentrations in Meriniemi beach water were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae sediment found at the Pyykösjärvi beach does not yet make the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue-green algae blooms, resulting in the formation of blue-green algae mass on the water surface.
The environmental action monitors the situation with frequent inspections.
If the bluish algae sediment turns into bluish algae blooms, this will also be announced separately on the beach notice board.
See the results of the bathing water here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance’s budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal for forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote the generational renewal of forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest farms and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational change of forest holdings is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Forestry Director of the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Mr Hakkarainen finds something to be criticised in the tax reform proposal.
A forest gift reduction is proposed for the forest owner’s clean capital income.
It is capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
In the opinion of MTK and Hakkarainen, the effect of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales result of the wood.
The proposal of the Ministry of Forestry starts from this, by making a deduction from the net capital income of forestry prevents that it would result in a loss in the capital income of forestry, which would be deductible in other taxes.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit even if he did not sell the wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
In the proposal, the tax deduction bound to the value of the forest is EUR 40,000.
It has been pulled too high in Hakkarainen's mind.
As such, according to him, 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners will be excluded from the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing the farm size.
In forest policy, forest gift reduction has been carried out for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A heavy hailstorm surprises drivers in Himanga - two cars crashed into a ditch and crashed into each other
The Himanga in Kalajoki had a special collision on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Board, two cars that were driven in a row escaped into a ditch, after which the driver in the rear collided with the driver in front.
According to on-call fire chief Harri Pyähtä, it is suspected that the descent into the ditch was caused by a heavy hailstorm.
There were two people in the back of the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident happened on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometres to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research by researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments to be more effective.
The findings of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research team show that the hardness of a cancer tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, it was possible to prevent the growth of cancer in laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing not only on cancer cells but also on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home killing continues in court, prosecutor demands murder sentence also for another perpetrator
The murder of Muhos family home continues in court for both convicted offenders.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for the murder of a family home in Muhos.
The second was sentenced to eight years and four months for murder and robbery committed as a young person.
The other is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of the killing was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of road safety as a young person and of transporting a vehicle without a right as a young person.
The District Court appealed against the judgment by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received a harsher sentence.
The prosecutor is demanding that a man with a lesser sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time.
According to the District Court, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as a director of a child welfare unit in a school in July last year.
The 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder allegedly attacked a director sitting from behind on a sofa in the living room.
The director had let go of the grip and led the young man to his room, when one of the youngsters hit him with a vacuum tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the mental state survey, both convicted offenders were fully understood at the time of the deed.
According to the court, the young people had planned to escape from the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrates in the world, growing only at the age of 156.
The world’s longest living vertebrate has been confirmed by an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark or holker can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156.
The life expectancy of an ice shark is increased by only one centimeter per year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists found out the age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The eldest was estimated to be 392 years old - though the throw in one direction or the other can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Wisdom - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
As much as a third of the state’s total tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump’s proposed change in corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease, especially with tax relief for the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
Corporate tax would be reduced from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount of money left uncollected, <0x24>1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump’s proposed reduction of 33 percent.
Inheritance tax would be abolished.
Trump blamed the state for over-regulation of business and bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on in a hurry must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Barack Obama’s health care reform needs to be revisited.
We need to appoint "experts" instead of "bureaucrats".
"Destructive" trade policy is one of the main causes of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements would be abolished.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty rate of 45% and those from Mexico to 35%.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers across the country.
Contrary to his habits, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by his assistants, despite the fact that it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists – including those close to the Republicans – see Trump’s program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her first show on Friday.
Tsunami from the past - People's News
The sea is turbulent, but the actual tsunami strikes in the middle of Madrid’s street turmoil – a reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var's novelty story.
Almodovar’s previous directing work Travel Lovers (2013) was a fun and rhombic satirical comedy, the predecessor of Iho, where I live (2011).
Julieta (2016) takes place somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene drama of love, relationships and family, with the mother-daughter relationship at its core.
The story is simple and seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be the same for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of an occasional encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be astounded until the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before the birth of his daughter, the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher from the TV series Time Between Ommelte (2013-2014), will be starring in the second female role.
Julieta’s aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a lump, but I would say it’s pretty funny and literally a one-time sweep.
There is a fair distance between Julieta and the often so characteristic blasphemy of Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var films, down to the humor.
It is an equally strong, discreet film, with good music in some places and quite sad, with elements of elegance as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of a Spanish director is still there, and it slowly starts to catch on as a pure form factor rather than a working dramatic effect.
People in the film suffer from illnesses, deaths, or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains just as cool.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a name person, the costumes change from scene to scene, and the same is true for eye-catching earrings.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the mechanics of the current scene, does not improve much on this.
When recurring mechanically, the impression is external and a bit unspiritual.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has written a manuscript based on three novels by Canadian author Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The novels have been published in the book Karkulainen: Stories.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly even literary filmization.
The material would have been emotionally incomparably strong for the drama, so much of the big stuff - especially the gnawing guilt - the theme of the movie deals with.
Written and directed by Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres on 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - People's News
No new cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the Finns in the Base will not collapse altogether.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be made in bulk.
There will be no further cuts.
The <0x24>4 billion savings already made are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Central) say during the budget meeting.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the proposal of the Ministry of Social Affairs, since the cuts in social security were already decided on in the spring spending limits session.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pension Index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Training cuts continue.
Municipal elections are haunted
Why are ministers so eager to emphasise precisely that no further cuts will be made on these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the result of the municipal elections, which leads the government parties in different directions, ruins the mood of the government for a long time.
However, the Gallup report that the Government Party expects the Finns to lose their cigarettes, even though the result of its previous elections was modest at 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, Perussuomalainen received 752 new delegates, most of whom will realize the price of influencing the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the government of three parties of approximately equal size depends on the ability of the Finns Party to endure.
Now it has not lasted, and more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the fermentation status of the parliamentary group of the party have also surfaced.
The 'no new cuts' rhetoric, on the one hand, obscures the fact that they will be done violently next year and, on the other hand, tries to soften the blow that is waiting for the Finns.
Big cuts in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set itself the goal of declining debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will take out <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the election, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt is not bending or even slowing down.
The second is to stick to the program.
That means even tougher cuts on top of the previous ones in the 2017 budget meeting.
The budget would be squeezed at least close to balance in 2018, and then in the spring, in the parliamentary elections, what comes next will be accepted.
With these measures, the debt will not be broken
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not bend, even if Juha Sipilä tries to incite a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki at the press conference on the budget prove this unmistakably:
The growth forecasts of the global economy have repeatedly proved to be overly optimistic, i.e. there will be no pull from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not risen much since the collapse in 2008, except during the temporary stimulus policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has lasted on average from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent by the middle of the next decade.
What is Responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, it will cost around six billion euros to maintain unemployment, which will in practice be covered entirely by taking out new debt.
This is the opinion of the Centre Party, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
Survey: We want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four believe that the organisation of childcare, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by TWO - The Municipality Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also delegates responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic schools, building supervision, upper secondary education and waste management.
The responsibility of the county is most clearly to be given to provincial planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities.
There is no desire to delegate any of the municipal tasks to the state.
Juvenile drunk driver flees police after chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran a police patrol in Joensuu on Friday night at half past one.
A police patrol attempted to stop a motorcycle that had not been lit, but the young man evaded the police at a reasonable speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantantie, from where it continued to Sorronahontie and to the smaller forest road where the motorcycle got out of the way.
After this, the young man ran away, but the faster-legged policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
A blow test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
A truck that was loaded with stones crashed into a ditch
A truck in a rock load crashed into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday evening at 21.15.
The truck had slid out of the road in a bend to the left and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver through a door above the crashed truck, along with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
It was up to the car owner to lift the vehicle.
The crashed truck spilled hydraulic oil on the road, which the rescue service absorbed into the peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki Lahdenkylä in southern Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman, about six feet tall, slim, and with white hair that extends under her chin.
Findings and clues about the missing person’s movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre’s hotline number 0295440513.
Elements of a major disaster in the air - see photo gallery of the devastation of Parafest
The flooding of Parafest’s tents caused massive damage.
The chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will recover financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed on the market stage at the end of Friday evening.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1 pm to 3 pm.
The program is arranged as planned.
The surge flow is generated in a thunderstorm cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a declining airflow.
Changes in the state of the thundercloud’s water bind heat, and thus the declining air mass cools down and accelerates its pace towards the ground.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
The trajectory of surges is difficult to predict.
The flooding hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where Parafest took place, on Friday afternoon before five o’clock.
Three of the tents fell over, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people slightly injured themselves in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported to further treatment with minor injuries.
Air pollution ages Londoners
Research shows that Londoners’ skin ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
According to the Evening Standard.
Caci, a British skin care company, analyzes the most toxic particles in London’s air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than the skin of, say, a peer living in rural areas.
The fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollutants that come from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk commuting near busy streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed, pushed man in front
The man had moved rocks in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor fell on the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor pushed him enough that he was transported to the central hospital for further investigation, seriously injured.
The tractor could not run any further, as it collided with the stones in front of it.
Renewed strength for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship League, will start the series in October from a better starting point than men’s memories.
The team has been together for three weeks now.
The common tone is sure to be found better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säis, who will continue as the head coach of Rienno, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni starts his second season in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwandan national team, is a 205-inch hacker.
Garchet is a passer-by, the Brazilian has a size of 198 cents.
Through Josban, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all of the indoor bandy world championships since 2003.
Now Tampere has its sixth competition, only 2013 was missed since Canada was better in the North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. formed the national football team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumpanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in Elizabeth, near New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such sport as floorball yet.
Sähly was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoki in Finnish Championships, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university in the Finnish Floorball Championship 1991-92, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls of the club for the championship.
Women’s Finnish Championships culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the Finnish Championships, with a balance of 51+34<0x3D>85 in 169 games.
The last season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen named to national team
Josban from Joensuu was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen from Enola was chosen to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Republic’s Brno EFT tournament on November 6-8.
25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men’s national games before this, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4<0x3D>13 points.
Tatu Väänänen, a 32-year-old defender from Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, has recovered from a thigh problem and is part of the national team’s standard fleet with 117 national matches.
Mika Kohonen was also named to the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Championships in December.
Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti is the head coach of the national team.
Beach volleyball player Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold is missing from the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volley Championships will be held at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
For three days, the medals will be played in both adult and adolescent series.
In cooperation with the Finnish Volleyball Federation and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the six best pairs of each series will qualify for the Finnish Volleyball Championship.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, raised by Elimäen NMKY, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volleyball team for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be on the lookout this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the Pesis Stadium.
I haven't played in the adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu says.
The Kouvola region lit a spark in Hasu’s sport and gave good food for a great hobby.
I have good memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 at Elimäki NMKY’s E-girls.
The top is too big a shirt, knee pads on the ankles and amazing ace screams and choreographies after the point,” Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was fun to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of the teammate coached us and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasu beach volleyball was already a natural choice during the junior season as a counterweight to indoor volleyball.
The beach of the curved pond has been played since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also watched the junior SM-tour competitions myself, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki in the Finnish Championships.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the duo ranked second in the tournament is clear.
The realistic goal is a medal.
We're still missing the SM-gold from the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
This weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await in the field of civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament.
The toe slippers are put on the nails, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Salomon Koli boldly started as a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Koli started working together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli as the successor of their home farm two years ago.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come in handy from agriculture.
This has been my thing ever since I was a little boy.
I’ve always enjoyed working on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I’ve put everything on the line.
If you want to start something, I think you need to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yard-tower, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I joined the project with great courage and I have been fully involved in it,” says Salomon Koli and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would turn out well again.
The goal of Salomon Koli, who breeds meat trucks, is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the contest of the young food producer of the Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
He will be able to vote on the magazine’s website until August 21.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (since June 2012) and the first reading above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The annual average inflation, measured by the cost of living index, was -0.8% over the past 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the cost of living index was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the price of the following consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is criticized as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has served as a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows its approximately 150 million daily users to customize reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that fits Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
Lenses are simple, face twisting tools that produce over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All false steps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat’s lenses have previously been criticized with accusations that the app promotes a blackface mask or favors bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised this week for some users a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth, and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people — a “yellow face” or yellow face.
And they wondered if these recurring controversies could be a sign of the company’s greater problem with diversity.
News and outrage spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company provided an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But for racist observers, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of photos was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was “at least offensive and uncomfortable.”
He added that "it's hard to argue against a comparison between an outrageous Asian caricature and filter effects."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face when taken to extreme degradation.
Snapchat is not the only company that transcends these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially diverse audience of young people may mean they’re even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an offensive image for the user, “it’s much more difficult for these guys to be discreet.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In a paper for Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed racial disputes reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s predominantly white male leadership and ended his post with the hashtag <0x23>DeleteSnapchat (<0x23>DeleteSnapchat)
“Either they don’t have a diverse representation of different skin colours on their staff, which is why they’re able to make decisions like this,” Zhu said, “or they have representatives of different skin colours at work, but they’re not in positions where they feel safe or can speak up.”
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and push for internal inclusion efforts.
Zhu, for his part, said he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say this isn't okay."
Congressional Panel Says Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a panel in Congress said officials from the U.S. military headquarters edited intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than what happened on the ground justified.
A mid-term report by a working group set up by the Republican Chairman of the House Defense Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defence Budget Subcommittee found “widespread dissatisfaction” among headquarters intelligence analysts, who said the superiors were judging their assessments of American efforts to defeat ISIS.
Headquarters, known as Centcomin, is a military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence outputs approved by senior Centcom executives typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than the facts on the ground justified. They were consistently more positive than the analysis produced by other agents in the intelligence community,” the report said in a press release.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable — our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision makers,” spokesman Ken Calvert, a California Republican, said in a statement.
The failures of Centcom’s management reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems in headquarters descriptions and analyses of the US efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that senior Obama administration officials have ordered reports to be tampered with, it describes analysts feeling as if Centcom leaders had put pressure on them to portray the threat posed by the Islamic state, ISIS, in a more positive light.
“Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters’ press releases, statements, and testimonies to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major attack to recapture Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," spokesman Mike Pompeo, a Republican in Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior intelligence chiefs at the U.S. military headquarters manipulated the headquarters’ intelligence output to minimize the ISIS threat in Iraq.
The team was created by Republicans when they heard that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic state was being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, will be followed by more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Department of Defense's Chief Inspector has launched an extra, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the Republican working group’s conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessarily isolated process of intelligence assessment by the ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the committee's chief Democrat.
According to Schiff, this process “prolonged the publication of inquiries,” worsened the mood among analysts, and “given not enough room for divergent perspectives.”
Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions with “pre-set or political narrative.”
On Tuesday, The Daily Beast reported on the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon’s Chief Inspector had opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Inspector General’s investigation is ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential national security issues.”
The investigation has other repercussions than just the question of whether US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year’s accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on the headquarters to provide honest estimates of military action in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects a controversy more than a decade ago when Centcom’s intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article that said that despite the objections of several analysts, the administration of President George W. Bush supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time contemplating the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, the Hooker group concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against Islamic state-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators regarded his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
United States wins women's hockey for fourth time in a row with Britain
The day after scoring three goals for the team to win Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team to win India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn’t sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of their paintings."
But this is what he knows: The Americans are in a 4-0 position in the Olympic tournament and they share their group’s first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it through the quarter-finals, and this game determines who will be ranked first and who will be second in their six-team group.
First placer avoids the strong Dutch, the leader of the second group, slightly longer at the start of the quarter finals.
No matter how Saturday’s game ends, the Americans have stirred up turmoil with their surprising success here, four years after being the last of the 12 teams to compete in the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up at the Pennsylvania Blue Bell and picked up a field hockey stick for the first time at the age of three (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel) when he joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not qualify for the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing went wrong for him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We did not have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've made a turnaround.
On Thursday evening, Bam started his first half-time goal with a knuckle shot near the finish line.
India had not won a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third round, when Bam took control of the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then rotated in the middle and dragged the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the fourth round in the middle of the final goal.
This zero game was the tournament's first for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good situation right now," Parnham said, "but it depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampoline peace in the middle of the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever the time, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, a fierce message of competition and effort.
It’s as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming stick that is transmitted from the archer to the swimmer and from the gymnast to the triathlete.
It’s impossible to turn on a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor’s conversation in a café queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympic champion and future heartbreaker with a smile, could well be one of those well-known names that are presented at prime time, supported by sponsorship agreements and good-natured TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold in a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species equally.
Farther from the center, partly in the shade, are those species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favourites, I would like to draw attention to the subdued charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, there has been so little notice of its presence in between over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realize at all that it was an Olympic sport.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not progress to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share medals for men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLennan will defend their London gold medals.
The trampoline, however, has a certain underdog charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for clown school than for the Olympics.
In this I have to admit that I am not an expert, I am just a fan of flightlessness.
The sport has potential for amusing, as can be seen from the endless swings of cartoons, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming, two species that basically combine in it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n, which means "springboard".
The champions jumped up to almost 30 feet in a giant trampoline, and they have to perform twisting sequences of movements (turns, folds and folds) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are assessed on the basis of execution, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries compete, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those looking for a medal must go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the pitch.
They hunt not only for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in television news coverage, for another ridiculous frontier: a world record or an Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical - and can even bring the viewer to tears.
But that’s also why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
The trampoline offers a rest from this.
Trampoline's up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new rise, appearing weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this is not without competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no furious rush towards the end, no leaps into the distance, only a dreamlike, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It is as close to Zen space as can be achieved at the Olympics.
The women’s qualifiers and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at 1 pm (ET), the men’s qualifiers will also be held on Saturday at 1 pm.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of their afternoon schedule starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic hustle and bustle, they offer a quiet, charming moment that most likely will not be noticed in the general chaos.
And if consciousness is only attained by offering male athletes to stare at and objectify (as recently suggested by U.S. male gymnasts, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
"Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as they spread to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
Human rights groups said the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Widespread video footage of demonstrations, believed to be at the end of last year or the beginning of this year, shows how security officials beat young people with sticks while forcing them to stand with their hands against the wall.
The U.N. Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Holding this country together has always been difficult, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the International Crisis Group in the Horn of Africa.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved enormously, and the capital city of Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about repression by the government, the opposition in the country has been limited and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
"If you suppress people and they have no choice but to protest, this is what will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
All the young people are demonstrating.
One generation is demonstrating.
Complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the stranglehold of coalition power.
After the much-criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat held by the opposition and now holds all the seats in parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing, and the battle along this tense and controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and re-arm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of turmoil beneath the surface, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through location-hiding network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for the demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromo and the Amharic, get along better.
The Oromo and the Amharic are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharic, who came mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
"We're on our way to organizing under one umbrella," Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu said.
The biggest protests have been in the Amharic and Oromo regions.
Many Amharic and Oromo think that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by members of the Tigre people, who cover about 6% of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to detect early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
“The current administration does not have such a basic instinct,” said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the security services controlled by the tigers don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such a state of turmoil was in 2005, when thousands protested about elections that, according to analysts, appeared to be first rigged and then looted by the government.
In the ensuing strike, many demonstrators died, albeit fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their remarkable progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the intensification of contempt for the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it's starting to take on a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked businesses owned by tigers, and anti-tiger hatred is becoming more and more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently said it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable allies to collapse.
"This," said Abdi, "is a real balancing act."
Donald Trump Explains Obama's Base-Isis Claim as 'Sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump tried to stifle the controversy over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he wasn’t serious when he repeatedly warned this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The study raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly with the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a turbulent period, in a difficult position where they have to explain the remarks he doesn’t necessarily mean.
After hinting at Wednesday night’s campaign meeting, Trump became increasingly keen to say the same in Thursday’s interviews, in which he warned that his intention was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
But early Friday morning, Trump tweeted that he was just being sarcastic.
The publication was a turnaround from the day before, when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remark by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took this to his ears.
The latest criticism storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining polling results.
Trump and Clinton were fighting for the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the issue.
Escapeing again to Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he found the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm before.
Late in July, after facing widespread criticism apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, “Of course I’m sarcastic.”
The approach allows Trump to speak at the border and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clarifies' one way or the other depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language of both candidates.
But I also think he’s sneaky about his statements and knows they’re vague enough to be filtered through a number of different lenses.
Instead of softening his speeches to a large voting audience, Trump has been even more baffled in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed that Trump is lagging behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tough in Florida.
While Trump generally seeks to avoid apologies for provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
Faced with an ever closer look over the last months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, put a lot of effort into defending the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I believe there are real, political comments in his words,” Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump’s allegation that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost an unknown, small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to deal effectively with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media, which rumored about his every word and were biased against him.
He mocked the “bad, pathetic” television experts who are trying to make him clear by saying, “They won’t succeed!”
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s excuse as new evidence that he was unfit for president.
Previously closed cafe returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg, which had no wireless network, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, Bedford Avenue was too expensive.
The store that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals lamented it as the latest loss in a city to be rebuilt as a middle class.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is devastated and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, it's also a reinvention.
The revived Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verbi has Wi-Fi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unrefined atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started at Verbi in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb used the same bagel supplier and bought an espresso machine of the same model.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it, too.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg-cheese butter sandwiches, and the coatings include capers and browned onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but they make fresh juices.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers, too," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verbi.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she wandered into the cafeteria.
He says that after Verb closed down, he gave up coffee for a while.
"I realized that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although on that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his usual iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another longtime customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been visiting Verbi faithfully since 2003.
He used to go there before work, and he always made the same order.
"Every day at five past seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were making my spicy bagel with butter," she said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes, for a change, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he has no grudges against the soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verbi that would use the cold extracted coffee from the cafeteria.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also approved the café.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to place it somewhere soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice shop wants to bottle and sell cold extracted coffee.
It is possible that the café expands into the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular, and he said it was desolating when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he was coming home as he walked in and ordered a coffee.
“I wanted to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: the debilitating food of the recession
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in his office.
President Roosevelt liked refined Fifth Avenue foods, such as foie gras and Maryland swamp turtle soup.
That day his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and plum pudding for dessert.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity with the people who are suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman was about life in a Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper will release on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of culinary solidarity, they meet the journalist at a dinner at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unrefined lunch bar in the Flatiron area that has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a serving of turkey, potato puree and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple found it appropriate to discuss eating during the recession.
"The worries were very popular," Ziegelman said.
Peanut crumbs, liver crumbs, bean crumbs.
They were made from an ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make up your dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the recession, the Americans’ tables, especially in the countryside, were like an eating-as-a-much-as-you-can-take-a-table.
Women’s groups cooked food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicles the way the nation survived the fact that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, inexpensive diet: Mystery foods such as crumbs and boxes became the main food, and the box was a “majestic way to use food scraps,” Ziegelman noted, as chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the heart of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
The special combinations were tested when calorie and nutrient content were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While doing research for a book that also included recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era dish where fried onions were stuffed with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman clarified: “It was unrealistic.”
Peanut butter is not suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Administration from 1923 to 1943, guided the country’s eating habits more than ever before or since.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “budgeters” and meet the challenge of turning lumps like pureed spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's 'Let Me Eat Cake' attitude.
While publicly praising the simple, Iowa country food of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in the almost gold-plated dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was so out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his own stomach.
As reported in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper with no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "provided not only one of Washington's most troubling, but also the worst-prepared food."
Many of the recessive eating habits were abandoned as soon as the earth got back on its feet.
Our heritage is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as how she couldn’t throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a hat-scene.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes an imposing name.
There was no whipped cream in the dessert, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly immersed their spoons in a sticky, brown glue.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe sacked me once and again.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, “slightly chopped walnuts could help.”
Gilead Reimburses Lawyer’s Costs in Hepatitis C Patent Fight Against Merck
A U.S. fiancé has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc. to be entitled to the lawyer's fees incurred in a case involving a hepatitis C patient against Merck & Co. Inc., a pharmaceutical company.
In June, Gilead was released from <0x24>200 million in fees for their violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead’s success drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. This release followed the discovery by a U.S. judge of Merck’s abuses, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a verdict filed on Thursday, U.S. fiancée Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to a waiver of the compensation it received in opposition to the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the lab work based on the pharmaceutical active substance sofosbuvir.
U.S.-backed forces say they have completely taken over ISIS-controlled Manbij
U.S.-backed forces have taken over the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of militants hiding in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 wing-gun prisoners held by the fighters, according to Sharfan Darwish of the SDF Allies, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned <0x24>10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned <0x24>10.75 million in income that year, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated <0x24>1 million to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly <0x24>5.3 million in speaker fees, and the former Secretary of State announced that he received <0x24>3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book about his career in the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, published a 10-year tax return.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York-based businessman Trump and his lawyers have pleaded with the tax administration for refusing to disclose tax returns.
"It's your turn," Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter, posting a link to a Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump’s special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has tackled the problem by publishing an online video on Friday highlighting prominent Republicans urging Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in a financial speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: publish his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little tax in the two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted numerous tax lawyers and accountants who said the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than <0x24>1 million a year pay at least 30 percent of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he is also undergoing a tax audit, and that Trump is not "fearful" of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The actual federal tax rate for the Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return showed that only <0x24>100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was an inexpensive, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported <0x24>109,000 in dividends and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers enhance elephant protection in Tanzania
Wildlife conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements – they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which coined the idea several years ago, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step approach to protecting homes and crops without hurting animals.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed the tools, we've seen a change of attitude in these communities, which are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without damaging them," said Damian Bell, executive director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include pointing an invading elephant with a flashlight and playing a trumpet.
If it does not stop the animal, throw the so-called "chilipilvi".
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and earth and a sparkle, after which the condom is twisted so that only the spark plug remains visible.
When a condom is lit, it bursts into a bang and bursts chili powder dust into the air.
One scent is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
As a last resort, there is a trigger that fires a Roman candle into the air. The fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code at Arab request
A French filmmaker with Jewish background unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli area code, which he said was due to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary Shoah about the Holocaust, unleashed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel from the country code list offered by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker addressed the matter at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the reply from there "stunned him".
The hotel’s receptionist said it was “a well-considered decision by the management of Kempinski hotels.”
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of Israel’s area code,” the employee said.
Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the incident “a great injustice,” the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported.
"We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But even more shameful is the fact that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident produced quite a counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply “give in” to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," said another publication, which pointed out that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called the incident “inattentiveness” and “excused” Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"The clear order not to include Israel in the shortcut list was never done," Kempinski's spokesman said, according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students
On Thursday, the students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as they gathered to protest the government’s public education system reforms.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement attempted to break up a group of students, leading to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, governor of Sao Paolo, proposed that less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300,000 pupils would be relocated to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place just days after the protesters moved together to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff while the country's Senate voted on his indictment.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran is growing by 71%
Since the lifting of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, says Levan Dzhagaryan, the Russian ambassador to Iran.
“Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have to a large extent shown interest in doing business in the country,” the ambassador said.
Russian companies will continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies will be ready to enter the market.
"Of course, one of the main goals of Iran's two-way cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, totalling <0x24>856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to a total of <0x24>697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to <0x24>158 million.
"The growth in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
For the first time, Iran was among the 20 countries with the highest number of tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Scotland’s Callum Skinner crashed into the finish line as the British grabbed gold.
Scotland's Callum Skinner won the men's team sprint at Rio's cycling stadium last night when the British team defended their 2012 London championship.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in a role in which his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled; the legend was proud of the young man as he raced to the finish, catching a victory for his favorite New Zealand team.
Four years ago, the United Kingdom won a shock victory, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after a modest sixth place in the March World Championships in London, although Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Special Envoy Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time for the Hindes to appear.
Hoy’s ending also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches held onto in Scotland in view of the potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
After his own lap, the Hindes were barely behind, but Kenny pushed the team to the lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and it included Hindes driving in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to keep up with the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
Skinner, a 23-year-old from Glasgow, said, "The comparison is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the World Champions.
It was absolutely unbelievable.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London alongside Kenny and Hoy in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately crashed on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his remarks, and his British rivals have not complained.
This time there was no such problem with the superior win.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten cycling disciplines in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the progress of the last five months, we will have a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny’s dedication, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s feat of winning three Olympic gold medals at one Olympic Games.
That would mean that Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (on that apparently sacred day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) – would receive a total of six medals in gold and one in silver.
It'd be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will compete in the sprint, which starts today and lasts for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I just enjoyed this one.
Team competition is always the best.
We win it together with our friends.
Winning alone is, frankly, lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the rank of knight."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest drivers in the four-man, four-kilometer race.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In 2012, the world record for winning gold in London was 3:51:659.
The first round and the final (22.42) will be held today, the second day of the race, when Wiggins will surely be the focus of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the qualifying period, when officials called him for a longitudinal examination.
In a similar women’s competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavie’s Katie Archibald advanced in the world record time with the clock stopping at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its mighty track cycling team will take over the central part of the Olympics and achieve a whole host of medals.
After presenting a truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been lowered before the Rio Games.
There has been drama, not least of which has been the April resignation of technical director Shane Sutton due to allegations of sexism and temptation, as well as the end of the racing careers of majors such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first-night races at the cycling stadium, it seems that the now legendary reputation of the UK for peaking at the perfect moment could once again be true.
The future of the Portland smelter is questionable due to cuts in electricity contract
The future of Portland’s Victoria aluminum smelter, as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs, is uncertain when an electricity company that distributes electricity to the plant revealed that one of the plant’s owners is terminating a distribution contract, so a cut in all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to extend the aid required to keep the plant in operation.
For a fixed period of 20 years, the subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, as a result of plant closures.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's meltdown is losing money and is in danger of closing.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the factory, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the factory's production price.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to end their contracts as well.
The majority of the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp. own smaller shares.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the melting plant’s physical electricity demand will continue,” he said.
According to the AGL, the agreements are so-called “protection agreements” that were supposed to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will effectively expire in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects the contracts to produce results in FY2017," the electricity company said.
All potential profit effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said it had already “predicted closure” by lowering the value of contracts in its accounts by <0x24>187 million.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to keep the smelter in operation or to secure the power supply of the smelter.”
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the contract was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts have been alert to the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier this week, AGL chief executive Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts per year.
"If both plants leave the market, this will be a significant reduction in [electricity] market demand.
For us as producers of electricity, this would not be a good thing,” he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality TV star, is on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the US Vogue's preferred September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and model at the Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a quirky (or maybe just Kardashian-style?) scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and with everyone’s favorite entertainment, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot their sister’s cover, but it ended in a classic design.
It's a cliché plot of almost every children's TV show's "birthday episode" (Seacrest says "you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning cartoon bunny), but Kris had to somehow get his other girls to benefit from this publicity.
That’s because we’ve definitely moved into a new Kardashian era with September’s Vogue.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have gotten Vogue's cover first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in its own category.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee notebook than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion, 615 of last year’s 832-page opus were advertising content).
Its cover star is so eagerly awaited to be revealed that in the last two years, images of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "celebrities who act as models" on the cover than "models who are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga’s honorary position.
But if Jenner, described by the magazine as the “success model” of his generation, hits the first category, he’s in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people or today’s young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner has all of this).
They are rightly talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
Last year’s cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
This feeling resurfaced with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But turning around in dissatisfaction is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup.
She and all her sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps that can be found behind the paywall.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she took to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she’s a reality TV star.
Community judicial centres expel 160,000 people every year
More than 160 000 of the population's most vulnerable people are expelled from the Community's judicial centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on its already marginalised operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services, already stretched to the limit of the Community, are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres census report, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland community legal centers are chronically underfunded, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government is cutting funding by 30 percent in June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents are forced to navigate amid complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately cancel these cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government delivered on its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign sued after alleged gun threat
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after they were told the campaign’s North Carolina operations chief threatened a worker with a gun in February while driving in a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by former state campaign software intern Vincent Bordin in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that “it wouldn’t happen.”
Chief Earl Phillip "raised a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pushed the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the suit.
After appealing to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini learned that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, the suit said.
"Weapons need not be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in the suit.
The challenge comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate indignantly told the public in North Carolina that “the people of the second addition”—which usually includes gun owners and gun enthusiasts—would be able to take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to elect judges.
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he was not in favour of violence.
Bordin’s challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance, as well as from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional distress.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the request.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlotessa, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign has been controversial.
The case is against Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings revival and prosperity to the entire stomach, not just local communities and parts of London.
For myself, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we put in a huge amount of effort to ensure that all our people and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
Just like before the 2012 London Games, some come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games and that we would be put to shame in front of the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question that is asked to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion has the potential to create up to 180,000 new jobs and <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth, as well as leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and within budget: from the T5, which has been voted the world’s best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2 built between the world’s two busiest runways.
Now the team is ready to complete the third runway, supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private money.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be one too.
It is time for us to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Treasury Department.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in cat and mouse play for ad blocking
For companies that receive money from online advertising, attempts to bypass an ad-blocking program are “cat and mouse play,” said one of the companies that make such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its computer-accessible pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post that said users could update the program’s filters to block ads again on social networking pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said its website code would be changed around ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it has been circumventing the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-to-back battle between the open-source ad blocking community and its evasives has been going on since the ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the battle is a strong indication of how much trouble ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a survey conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, which is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is after ad blockers for pages on the computer, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the spokesperson said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook consider such an action worth investing in.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “advertising preference” tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site’s non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss highway apparently due to suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after the woman was hit by several vehicles on the highway early Thursday hours in a case that was apparently suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 near Morges, in the canton of Vaud, just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a “desperate act” and lay down in the dark on a road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who apparently tried to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, police said, urging them and all eyewitnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has been launched, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneva.
"It remains to be seen whether any of the involved drivers will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It is up to the prosecutor," Hofstetter said.
Two similar incidents in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases — both of which had a person walking on a dark highway — it was estimated that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, police were acquitted of the death penalty due to his negligence after he hit and killed a man who was lying on A! near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had passed out on the road, the court said.
The court found that the police officer who was responding to the emergency call was driving in a justified manner, and that the man’s presence on the road was “a completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information on Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was probably once inhabited.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out if Venus, with its hot, anhydrous surfaces and carbon dioxide filling with atmospheric atmosphere, could at some time have been Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotational speed of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and still could have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
There were probably drier areas on the planet, but there was once enough water and geographic variation to enable life and to protect against rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 percent fainter sun.
"In a simulation of the GISS model, Venus's slow rotation reveals its daylight to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio said in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella to protect the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than the Earth’s current temperatures.
The model produced a story about the evolutionary stages of Venus, similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
While Venus was likely to be habitable at some point, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over a period of several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gases - Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche’s coach and deputy director of hockey, saying the reason was lack of influence in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorado Deputy CEO/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and said the team would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have done my duty as the vice president and head coach of hockey in Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
I have been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and the deputy general manager of hockey matters must be fully in line with the vision of the organisation.
He must also be able to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach in his first season at Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a mid-division victory, but Minnesota defeated Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
The Avalanche games of the 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost five points to the Wild, losing the Western Conference Wild Card playoff position.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups - two at both the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers Continue Negotiations and Delay Strike
The labor struggles of North Sea oil workers for wages will be postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the lead negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been randomly organised on drilling platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolving the current dispute,” the joint statement said.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings, starting early next week, so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
Trade unions say their recent industrial action, which they say will be the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against potential pay cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut North Sea contractors’ commissions by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company’s remuneration follows a 10% decrease in the number of contractors in its countries in 2014.
The company said further cuts would give the company the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people's payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company lightens its operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain’s June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes of the generation in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
“We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and across the country,” he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than <0x24>1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average for the previous five years has been around <0x24>7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiadian cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete list of the star rotation speeds of the Pleiadian star cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at varying speeds and how rotational times are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Pasadena Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at Caltech.
The Pleiadian star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now at their highest level.
At their peak rotational speed, these mature stars throw large amounts of star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the appearance of recognisable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger ones making pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades 'ballet,' we see that slow spinners tend to be more massive, while the fastest spinners tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiadian star cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for estimating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian star cluster provides an anchor for stellar rotation in theoretical models that encompass both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational speed and so to speak hang their ‘dance shoes’ on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Pleiadian rotational velocities in three articles to be published shortly in the Astronomical Journal.
