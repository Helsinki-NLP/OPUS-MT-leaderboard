European inflation on food slipped away
The accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to fast-moving increases in food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in the 13 countries of the eurozone, with annual inflation of 3.1 per cent, after 2.6 per cent in October, the EU’s Luxembourg statistical office reported.
The official prediction was only 3% likely, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the central banks of the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not cut the base rate, saying that a reduction along with rising commodity prices and decreasing unemployment would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but close to, 2%.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the trap of twenty-two: “you have to talk down” inflation so that it doesn’t have to act on this later.
In Germany, November inflation is at 3.3 percent, a 12-year record; in Spain, it has risen to 4.1 from 3.6.
Eurozone inflation has been driven high by rising food and energy prices.
Wheat futures rose by 88 percent and soybean prices reached their highest level since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also had to be paid significantly higher in 2007.
The world price of oil rose by 52 percent this year, and last month it cost almost <0x24>100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but will drop to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
Analysts say the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3% for the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB will have reduced interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
After a long stagnation, Fidesz’s support has grown significantly to the beginning of December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has never seen such low socialist support at 13 percent before.
In the case of the clear party voters, the difference, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, would mean more than two-thirds (71 per cent) of the support of MSZP against one-fifth (20 per cent).
According to the survey, the MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the total population is 2%.
The number of supporters of both camps among the voters is one per cent.
The economic climate has deteriorated even further to the previous low – it has never been so high, with 41 percent of those who explicitly considered the country’s economic situation to be very bad, while another 46 percent said the situation was quite bad.
The families are now judging the change in their own financial situation more pessimisticly after the more hopeful prospects of spring and summer.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than all previous Gallup surveys, 71 percent of respondents said that the Prime Minister is doing his job badly rather than well.
13 per cent of the respondents trust Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny or trust him very much, while Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n has 38 per cent of the supporters.
54% do not trust the Prime Minister and 27% do not trust the Fidesz president.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much part of society thinks that it is possible to deal with dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister without changing the government.
While after the riots last October, 35 per cent considered it desirable for the government and the head of government to remain, today this figure is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees the solution only in calling new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterised by the fact that 60 percent of those surveyed respond to a question about their willingness to participate, saying they would definitely leave, and an additional 20 percent say they would most likely leave.
By comparison, only 55 percent would be sure to take part in a "now Sunday's parliamentary election" and an additional 15 percent would consider it likely. The result of the referendum would not be questionable based on the intentions of the present.
74 percent would say no to tuition, 79 percent would say no to visitation, and 84 percent would say no to daily hospital fees.
If we only look at the same proportions among those who promised to take part in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, visa fees and hospital daily allowances.
The most expensive is Auchan, with Tesco raising nearly a fifth.
In the trade triangle in Budaörs, hypermarkets maintained last year’s average price increase of 16 percent, with the difference that VAT did not increase this year.
Article of the Daily Economy
The average increase of the Daily Christmas Basket in the Budaörs trading triangle was 16% this year, but in all hypermarkets there was an increase of well over a thousand forints in value.
As prices in grocery stores have already “shrunk” in December last year, there has been no significant increase in prices compared to the previous high base.
But it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they could get last year for well over nine thousand forints, they can’t get it for even ten thousand for now.
The Daily basket exceeded the psychological limit of 10,000 forints by at least 91 forints in the hypermarkets examined.
The highest basket value was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, but turkey breast fillet, walnuts and poppy also became very expensive.
The price of flour and bread in the stores followed the data of the HCSO, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not push the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of the two-liter reversible bottle of Coca-Cola was under 200 forints, so even with the deposit fee, only 257 forints were requested for the product.
However, this year Auchan was the most expensive in the Daily basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
Compared to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora and Tesco have increased their daily shopping cart prices by about 18 to 18 percent.
Compared to last year’s most expensive and this year’s cheapest basket value, the difference was 12%, while the difference between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket value was 21%.
The average increment was 1,480 in HUF.
Last year, the average price increase was HUF 1,206, so last Christmas the VAT increase had an impact on prices.
It was precisely this process that disrupted trade, and the stores were apparently unable to decide what margins to apply for each product, because they were unable to calculate the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If the turnover of a product is badly planned by the trader, it can make a significant profit on the margin adjusted for the traffic intensity.)
Due to the VAT, last year the price increase of the Daily Basket was so extreme that the most expensive was HUF 1,720 more than in 2006, while the price difference for the cheapest was only HUF 844.
This year this extreme did not show up, as the most expensive one was HUF 1630 more than last year, and the cheapest one was HUF 1284 more expensive.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic increase in prices, with daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, by the way, does not necessarily justify the data of the Central Statistical Office: for some basic foods, the statistical office measured a price increase of more than 30 percent over a 12-month period.
In addition to eggs, for example.)
According to the Daily Basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of the already quite expensive product last year produced a price increase of just over 10 percent compared to the base in the worst case scenario.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the egg suppliers, and the drastic price rises have been scammed by the multinationals as well.
In the trading golden triangle, hypers do not complain, constantly reporting a good year.
In our experience, most of the customers in the three stores we visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy a lot of everything, they take the durable food to the plateau.
On Wednesday morning, there were serious lines in front of the cash registers in all three stores, because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that in rural areas the turnover is weaker, and more people complain to research companies that even their plans do not generate revenue, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
They save on disinfectants in many places
This year, more than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds and the overcrowding of the staff are not in favor of stopping infections, says the head of the department of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
They also save on disinfectants in many places.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital.
A man was found to be resistant to antibiotics after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred earlier this year.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but soon after he had to return with MRSA, and a major surgery had not been performed since because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, head of department at the National Centre for Epidemiology.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, the rest is unknown.
About two-thirds (683 infections) of the infections were caused by MRSA, a drug known as methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. pharyngitis, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics and are well curable.
However, if antibiotics are used too much or not properly, a bacterium that responds well to antibiotics develops into a bacterium that is highly resistant to antibiotics and spreads rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
Especially when the immune system is temporarily or permanently malfunctioning, it can cause serious hospital infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning - sepsis - in patients with a weakened body, elderly or low weight.
According to the medical director of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections belong to the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is just not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not tested.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff treats the patient with rubber gloves and masks, and they have the appropriate antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital will be checked in advance for MRSA, but it is not always possible to avoid infection.
Not in fashion for sampling
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current hospital conditions and conditions in Hungary are not favourable for preventing the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should check incoming patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these tests also plays a role.
Most cases are thus revealed when the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and pathologies.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent the development of resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always adhere to this.
Microbiological samples are even rarer in outpatient and primary care, Böröcz Karolina said.
They save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence confirms that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another through the mediation of healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of gloves, masks play a very important role, but there are also significant shortcomings in this in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplets and contact, however, in the domestic hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
In fact, the wards are often crowded, and the beds are often very close to each other, although, from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately, Karolina Böröcz also noted that hospitals in poor financial situation are saving on disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, so the chances of developing infections are even higher.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the appropriate precautions are followed, there are fewer such infections, or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurers, so they are fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has included prevention and reduction of MRSA in its programme.
The program seems to be successful, and the reported data show a decreasing trend of MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) focuses on preventing the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
He was not drunk on the police officer who caused the accident.
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the 21st district police chief has been prepared.
It is impossible that the head of police of the XXII district, who had resigned from his post in the meantime, and who had killed a pedestrian on Tuesday, could have led him drunk or in a state of intoxication, Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Prosecutor’s Office, informed on Friday after the expert opinion on the matter had been prepared.
The expert opinion backed up the primary findings of the investigation, which had already established that the former police chief did not drink alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The then head of the XXII. district police station, while bending in Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII. district, hit a 55-year-old man who did not want to cross the road at the designated pedestrian crossing.
(The latter, i.e. that the pedestrian did not cross the zebra, is not a mitigating circumstance according to the rules of the Road Traffic Code, the turning driver should still give priority.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
Due to the incident, the district police chief resigned and asked for his retirement, according to the police, because the incident shocked him so much.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating the case.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigating prosecutors from the beginning.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit lines for education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy on Friday in Budapest.
In 2006, the European Development Bank (EDB) approved a budget allocation of EUR 300 million for the financing of transport and environmental projects from the Cohesion Fund, of which EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties, and the contract now signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan agreement is also used to finance education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary for this purpose, with the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million to be used later in the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract worth 50 million euros, which will be used primarily for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the 4th metro was also mentioned.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to the question of whether and how to amend the original contract.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this could take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,4 billion.
The interest on the loans shall be provided by the EIB with a grace period of 8 years and no maintenance commission linked to the EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astonishing - the attention of the whole of Europe is focused on the formerly little mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the EU’s still cheapest but fast-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
The most popular property buying destination in Eastern Europe now is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains are the most fashionable areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, on the seaside are Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sunny Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar, but more and more people are looking for properties in the Kavarna and Balchik area.
Analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria say that sooner or later the central part of the country will attract the attention of investors – such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – and that more and more people are shopping around the extremely cheap Rus.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, and the commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golf resorts, making it a top destination in the summer and winter seasons as well as in the other two seasons.
Foresight investors are therefore already making large purchases, for example in the Bansko area.
Analysts say that buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also looking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most of the customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and the Black Sea and ski resorts have traditionally attracted a large number of Russian customers.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgy Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers either buy refurbished properties for between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000, or demolished old houses for between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000, and then renovate them.
They require good accessibility and communication facilities, it is important for them to have a metropolis, shops and, in general, the proximity of a local doctor.
The second category is for holiday buyers (Bulgaria was added to the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of business investors who buy in the hope of medium- or long-term value growth.
The price of real estate in the capital is constantly increasing as demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, they have increased by 21% a year over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices is substantially higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to Minister of the Environment and Water Affairs G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, the meetings of experts will be concluded on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the discussion of the international climate regime after 2012 will continue with the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts beyond the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
There is currently a heated debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently want to negotiate precise figures, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question at the conference is whether developed countries will undertake to reduce emissions and provide both financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
Agreements have also been reached on aid to developing countries.
The fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, expected within the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF).
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of the Environment and Water Affairs G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its flagship role in global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the "post-2012 agreement", and is ready to undertake a reduction of up to 30% if other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to take on commitments that match their responsibilities and capabilities.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor pointed out that in 1997, the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol agreed to a reduction of 5.2 per cent, including the EU - then 15 Member States - of minus 8 per cent.
The Hungarian obligation is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the period 1985-87, which our country will comply with, the Ministry of the Environment said in a press release.
The stakes are high in Bali, as the long-term international climate policy agreement has to be concluded within two years, otherwise its entry into force would surely be postponed beyond 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol reduction commitments would not be immediately followed by another international emission reduction scheme, which the IPCC, the latest international scientific body on climate change, which has also pointed out in the UN’s Nobel Peace Prize report, has
This would delay emissions reductions and make an increase in the Earth’s average temperature above 2 degrees Celsius inevitable, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
Video footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is being shared by British military units to promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was the first to post on YouTube: Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These images, taken with a miniature helmet-mounted camera, will be checked by the Air Force Operations Command in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they will be uploaded to the Internet by the locals.
The political message is unavoidable
139 images of the air force have been uploaded to the Internet in this form, and more than 75,000 people have watched their “channel”.
The British Defense Ministry registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and will publish videos of operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Commonwealth Office and the Iraqi International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operations in Afghanistan
The original intention of the Air Force was to upload the videos for recruitment purposes, and the Department of Defense said this would be a good way to inform the public about the real purpose of the military’s presence abroad.
“Propaganda published in this form costs almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment ads,” defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, “but it inevitably carries some political message, as it proves the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government in a peculiar way.”
The Americans made a game.
The army also has a problem with the fact that in addition to carefully edited, censored footage, amateur videos are added to the distribution, which also show the deaths of soldiers, for example: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the officers talk about the losses at most, but they do not show the bloody side of the fight.
A number of videos of the Iraqi and Afghan war scenes have already been released on the internet, which were taken live, but have only recently been received by the British army.
The Americans are recruiting in a slightly different way, with the free-to-play shooter America's Army, in which the player can take on the role of a soldier in a more or less realistic simulation.
There will be a Christmas party and a Christmas party at the ministries.
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not seem sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a year-end workshop for her colleagues, who will be able to say goodbye with cakes and coffee from 2007.
There are ministries where there is a live music party, and there are ministries where raffles and toasts are used to bring Christmas atmosphere into the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - giving fun to the power.
The state offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest ministry Christmas party will be held by the Ministry of Defence this year, but HM is not waiting for the ministry employees.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of fallen soldiers receive a gift, at the Missionary Christmas, the family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited to the event, but there is also a reception for the press.
The wallet will devote <0x24>25 million to the mood at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are kicking you out of the harness compared to other wallets.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future, for a total of HUF 4,320,000, and about 300 of the 600 ministry employees are expected to be guests.
They will stick to the Christmas atmosphere at the wallet ceremony, but there will be performers and raffles.
The Christmas of the NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and was held in the building of the National Council for the Judiciary (OIT) on Wednesday - there were also concerts and dinners.
The room rent cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
We know that one department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration: this is arranged by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU money.
For this purpose, the building of the V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z was rented.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt. because we failed to reach the competent person.
I don't need a suit
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement, which held a Luca Day ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
He did not ask them for money for the use of the OIT rooms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister’s toast, and after dinner it was possible to dance to live music.
To his [origo] question, he was told that at the ball there was no obligation to wear the evening dress or the suit.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Local Government is organizing a Puritan party.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and a celebration in its own building for 400,000 forints.
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is not officially expecting her colleagues for a Christmas party, but for a workshop at the end of the year.
They expect one hundred and eighty guests, who, the press department said, will receive only coffee and cakes, so the party will be brought out from 350 000 forints.
Minister Gordon Bajnai, however, will simply have a toast with his colleagues in the aula of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas meeting in its own large hall, for which 436 employees are expected.
Each guest will be given 2500 forints for the Christmas party - the sum will include a buffet reception and a toast.
Since J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres has been the minister, the employees of the PM celebrate the same Christmas every year.
But there will be no Bulihingula, the officiality will be reinforced not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time.
The Ministry of Agriculture will give a New Year’s reception on January 20, the Ministry’s Christmas is cancelled.
The reception will be held in Vajdahunyadv<0xC3><0xA1>r, V<0xC3><0xA1>rosliget, and according to the Ministry, 1000 forints will be dedicated to each of the 100 guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple standing reception, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief ministerial toast and end with a subdued snack.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold any Christmas parties at all, they told [origo] in the relevant press departments.
The price of the Ministry of the Environment’s official Christmas could not be stated in the press department.
In any case, more than 400 people were invited to the party, which will be held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The Giant Strike Forces Are Gathering
On Friday, the League Trade Unions and the National Association of Workers’ Councils will form their strike committee, which will coordinate the indefinite strike on Monday.
A protesting rally will be held on Saturday, and on Monday - the day of the final vote on the health insurance law - the cessation of work will begin.
The action will certainly cause significant disruption in transport, as rail traffic will almost completely stop and the BKV will be on strike until 13.00.
On Friday afternoon, the League trade unions will present the details of Monday’s strike organized in cooperation with the National Association of Workers’ Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be established to coordinate Monday’s actions.
On Saturday, a protesting assembly will be held, and from Monday on, organisations joining the strike will cease work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that no date has been set for the end of the strike that has begun - on the day of the vote in Parliament on the health insurance law.
If the National Assembly does not approve the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
If the bill is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the continuation.
According to the agenda of the National Assembly on Monday, it is also possible that the health insurance law will only be voted on late at night or at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, significant disruptions can be expected in transport: work at the railways will be stopped for an indefinite period, in the morning some of Budapest’s public transport, more than half of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies, may stop.
At the same time, there will also be a half-track roadblock in many parts of the country.
A number of trade unions and NGOs have joined the call for strikes, and the list of these is being updated on the League’s Monday.
Some organizations have declared a strike for an indefinite period, while others have declared a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Union of M<0xC3><0x81>V and Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient service, even though more and more people travel by rail as the Christmas holidays approach.
According to the previous reports, the BKV will be on strike from the start of operations until 1 p.m. at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., and the LIGA Electricity and Thermal Energy Trade Unions will be on strike for four hours, and the Educators’ Trade Union and the Educators’ Democratic Trade Union have called for a two- and two- to eight-hour work stop.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike at different times nationwide, and the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector of the SZEF (EDDSZ) is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraws its proposal for health insurance reform and launches a new concept for social debate.
The second requirement is the gradual introduction of a new method of calculating pensions due from next year.
The third is to ensure the possibility of inclusion in the scheme even before 2010 in the case of early-retirement pensions for worthy jobs.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) belonging to the League Trade Unions does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport regarding the railway wing lines, and is waiting for another offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increased the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August this year with the support of the Jobbik Movement for Hungary, have increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division.
The company’s “risk warning” stated that the biggest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that “with the already existing ethnic tension between the Hungarian Gypsies and non-Gypsies, violent ethnic clashes may develop even in the short term”.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably aimed at provoking such an act, the research institute added.
This is due to one of the main omissions of Hungarian political actors: “the public discussion of the Roma issue was handed over by public actors to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy against the Gypsy-Hungarian opposition.”
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts, they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have “deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the confidence in the stability and democratic development of the country”.
It is a part of the reorganisation of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, which has gained more and more publicity and momentum since the autumn of 2006, that since the summer of 2007 several organisations have been formed in Hungary, calling themselves “national self-defence” associations.
“The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as NGOs, while openly proclaiming the preparation of their members – even armed – for defence (disaster protection, defence, law enforcement) tasks, citing the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state,” they added.
They noted that all this is done in accordance with the method which, based on the anti-political and anti-partisan nature of society, seeks to put various political aspirations into civilian robes.
The emphasis on civility and the form of the association is therefore not only intended to avoid the legal pitfalls of court registration in the case of these associations, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk-increasing factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential threat in several neighbouring countries, and the ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by citing the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
This has an impact on the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so political risks have increased for the region as a whole.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background to the establishment of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass Roma riots that broke out in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took advantage of this and decided to set up a guard, saying the organization’s goal was “national self-defence.”
For the past 17 years, Bulgaria has experienced “gypsy terror”, but the state has remained idle and indifferent, the political capital said.
They added that the initiative sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
The increased risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they are setting up their own guards as resistance.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma will react similarly to the threat by organizing their own self-defence.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, Research Director of Political Capital told the telegraph office that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis annually, and if they experience anything that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The holidays are not red everywhere.
In Hungary, the law clearly identifies red-letter days, and it has become common practice to rearrange workdays around the holidays, which will be less next year.
The holidays are not unified in the EU and the United States.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and public holidays.
The public holidays are mostly linked to church holidays and important historical events.
We are celebrating the New Year as well: the last day of the Old Year and the first day of the New Year are both holidays – the latter for the sole purpose of resting the New Year’s Eve.
We have a total of 11 red-letter holidays throughout the year.
The 15th of March and the 23rd of October, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, are also national holidays.
On the 20th of August we celebrate the founding of the state, on the 1st of May we celebrate the work, and on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have a two-day holiday of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our state, national, or even religious holidays are seldom on weekends according to the calendar, it has become a practice to shift workdays when we work only one day before or after the red-letter holiday.
It is true that the price of extended weekends is that we do not stay away from work and school on the preceding Saturdays.
The exact time of the day immediately before or after the holiday is regulated by a special decree of the Minister of Labour for many years.
The legislation applies to all employers and their employees, civil servants and public service employees.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions that operate without interruption and, due to their purpose, also operate on public holidays.
This year, the work schedule changes only around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December life in the country almost stops, as experience shows that most people “slide off” the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve, or use their saved holidays for this purpose.
Next year, there will be more of our holidays in the middle of the week and at the end of the week, so there will be fewer shifts of working days than this year.
First, the calendar changes around the holiday of work, so that the workers can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day in exchange for Friday, May 2.
The second relocation is linked to the 23 October holiday: work will have to be done on Saturday, 18 October, instead of the 24th on Friday.
However, the end of the year can be completely in the spirit of the holiday next year, as from 24 December there will be a non-stop break almost everywhere, even if it falls on New Year’s Eve Wednesday.
6 Little Things That Can Annoy Your Colleagues
Emails we forget to send, voicemail messages we never get, innocent lies we hardly even notice: they “color” everyday life at work.
The question is, do you get used to the minor inconveniences or put on gloves and consciously avoid situations that are misunderstood and annoying to others?
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you about the marketing department," one of your colleagues said.
That's why you missed a meeting?
At best, you’ll regret it and try to make amends, maybe call the marketing department to tell them you forgot to pass the message (this is the less standard solution).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before making an awkward apology, it’s worth thinking about what you can do to make your colleagues feel uncomfortable and consciously try to avoid it.
Are you borrowing something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more annoying than grabbing a piece of paper, office supplies, or your phone, and it's nowhere to be found.
Do you remember yesterday you put your stapler on the table, but by the morning his legs were squeezed?
Do you find a pencil that you think is lost on a colleague’s desk?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without asking them, because they are rightly angry at you for stealing their property.
Don’t pocket office envelopes, post-it, because it can be uncomfortable if you run out of them early, and you need them right away.
Are you talking about your colleagues' privacy?
There is no good way to stop the rumor.
Who, who, what did you do?
Where and why?
Don’t tie your information (assumptions) about your colleagues’ privacy to everyone’s nose!
If one of them shares his deepest secrets with you, don’t abuse his trust.
Bury what you have heard and do not discuss it with your coworkers in your absence, even if others know about your coworkers’ affairs.
Are you unreasonably sick?
When you call the office and report sick because of a splitting headache because you feel unwell, or you feel like you would rather rest that day; think that your work, your urgent tasks, your futures work, must be done by someone else for you.
Don’t mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you’re not going to go to the office the next day, or there might be something that makes you have to stay at home, signal it so that your colleagues and boss don’t face your absence the next day.
Bumping, giggling, phone calls
Have you gotten into work, but are you rudely drawn out of it by the giggles of your colleagues?
Have you inadvertently witnessed a telephone conversation that would have been better not to have been heard?
Do not disturb your coworkers with buzzing, singing, loud talking (which you do above their heads), or with beating feet, constant swearing, or loud dissatisfaction.
These can all be confusing, even if they are not immersed in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If something isn’t in time, you forgot to send an important letter or message, don’t blame anyone else for your forgetfulness.
Don’t refer to the chaos that may exist in the office, your loud-mouthed colleagues.
Admit that you have made a mistake and that someone else has had a disadvantage, and eliminate the disadvantage.
Ask how you can make up for your mistake, make up for your failure.
Do you feel at home in the office?
Pants and slippers: comfortable to wear at home, but not in the office!
Don’t wear comfortable clothes when your job allows it.
Don’t be lazy, your colleagues, and honor yourself by going into the office in ordinary clothes – if your job requires it – in a pretty, elegant way.
If you want to meet me, you're no longer interesting
Taking the car in the usual morning traffic jam.
There is a special melody from the radio: the sound of a violin accompanied by electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The music changes pace and the bass arrives next to the previous tones, and then a female choir joins in as a real jewel.
Zagar's "Wings of Love" is on mr2.
For a long time, the Hungarian music scene did not pamper us with high-quality electronic pop.
But right now, it seems like the traffic is different when you're listening to the new Zagar album.
Yonderboi’s appearance, some new and exciting productions coming up from the Hungarian digital underground slowly changes the overall picture, and even though the guitar-drop garage rock, the Hungarian electropop proves again that there is a new under the Sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started from Pécs, and played in Yonderboi’s orchestra himself, until – perhaps because two hornets could not fit in a cs<0xC3><0xA1>rda – he took his own path.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, however, he began to break through when film soundtracks were asked to compose (e.g.
Ferenc Török Season).
His formations, initially playing in smaller clubs, were introduced to a wider audience when wan2 magazine ranked their first album of 2002 among the 50 most important Hungarian albums, and declared Zagar, in the company of Yonderboi, to be the only Hungarian trend makers who seem to be marketable in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band became "trendy", but of course no one asked them if they liked to wear the label.
The band reacted as it should: they made a new, better record.
The newly released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead could open new paths for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity with the initial years in Pécs.
This was one of the lines of Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger’s old band.
With the aerial, aerial reference we would be on the spot, but besides the aeriality of the music, the influence of the louder guitar, rock and roll has now appeared - in line with the spirit and trend of the era.
At the Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris premiere of the album, György Ligeti, a singer currently working with The Puzzle band in England, introduced himself in these songs.
The album also produced a real radio hit, and Mr. Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who recently played popular music from the morning until the evening, started to smuggle into the ears the grandiose melodies of Wings of Love recorded with the six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
Hvg.hu asked Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: This new hit song now raises the question: how much layer music do you have left?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The definition of layer music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two kinds of popular music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
So-called alternative underground music can be flat, meaningless, and just as ready for sale, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop can also come from an honest motive.
The host attitude also operates in this spirit, regardless of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.B.: In foreign countries, especially to the west, popular music has bigger traditions.
There, not only the ten-twenty-year-olds go to concerts, but also the older ones.
They are more interested in observing the changes in popular music that are taking place around them, because it is also considered part of contemporary culture.
Q. What is the role of the public in your work?
Does it matter who, where, or how many people listen to your music?
BS: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born for a reason, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where the interaction is already active, but this is only in the intangible changes of the moment.
Still, I've noticed that if you want to meet the audience, you're no longer interesting.
Q. How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works solo and has built his career more west of us.
Zs.B.: We’re not really going his way, despite the fact that sometimes they try to explain it in our music.
We're more of a team player who trusts the other person's musical presence and lets it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi’s music, as many of us left his band and started on another path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love came first on mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi’s top list.
Many people heard the name Zagar for the first time.
Have you consciously opened up to a broader layer with a more popular style?
Zs.B.: We didn’t have a plan to write a hit and then sell the album.
This song is about more.
It was meant to be the finale of the album, with which we tried to resolve the sound orgy that had been done on the album and the heavier themes.
Q. How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of assembling this choir from the sounding soloists of our home music scene.
This is how the six-member choir – Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh – was formed, which we then named Underground Divas.
HVG.hu: Is this how the song was designed or shaped by the girls?
Zs.B.: The number had been in instrumental version for a long time, then when the record material was assembled, we thought that we needed something else for this number.
The chord procession attracted my singing to him.
That night I sang the melody that the girls later learned.
At first, it was almost spontaneous and frightening.
I remember being very electrified at the time, but of course I needed the Divas.
It wouldn't have worked so hard with my voice.
HVG.hu: Both on the album and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There is no solo (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have their own roles, they sing together completely and they are not louder than music, so the music doesn’t just accompany their singing.
They were also in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
B: The fact that they were standing in the back was purely because of technical problems.
However, we are aware that we did not want to share the roles of the speaker.
The number is also about forgetting our ego a little bit about where it came from, where it’s going, just letting those particular wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
Q. Who did you do the most work with?
Zs.B.: In fact, the musical creative process with none of them, rather than the mixing, were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on a competition piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't work for a long time, and then slowly everything came into place, like in a puzzle game.
Q. What’s your favorite song about the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concert and the fact that I have already "released" the album.
Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth, and Never The Same.
The traitorous broker risked billions because of a feeling of inferiority
Unfaithful embezzler.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French bank giant Société Générale, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, he lost nearly five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel, who had no talent at all, was more of a big player trying to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market in time.
"He's mentally debilitated," said his superiors informing the police.
However, as Le Monde reported, Kerviel’s testimony reveals that at the end of last year, he made a profit of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion from his business.
Crisis not only in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he said in a statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
The opportunity was felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, news came that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages for low-income or past repayment problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put me on a good horse.
At the end of the year, the profit reached 1.6 billion euros.
"I didn't know how to announce the first half a billion," Kerviel admits, adding that he didn't keep anything for himself.
In his testimony, he admits that he falsified his reports in such a way that they could not be discovered.
He also managed to trick his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange became interested in his transactions.
The risk was profit.
Were you afraid you'd find out?
I'd rather not.
“I thought that just the fact that I made <0x24>1.6 billion for the bank would reassure them.”
Where did you get the willpower to take such a risk?
Its position was gradually reached.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at the Société Générale bank from 2000.
His annual salary was around <0x24>51,000.
Two years later, he became a broker-assistant and became a stand-alone broker in 2005 with a salary of <0x24>90,000 a year.
He knew that he would never earn as much as others.
“In 2005, during my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me with a bad eye.
It is also because of my education, professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigators.
Soon after his arrival, his first great success came.
Allianz was earning money thanks to its shares, as it wagered half a billion euros to fall these shares during the London bombings.
And it started an avalanche - he wanted more.
While you're looking for me, we'll leave you alone
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses supposedly knew everything, or rather suspected it.
"While I was making money, they closed their eyes."
There was a blow at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
One weekend in mid-January, he tried to cover it up.
When he left for work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
His freedom made him suspicious.
“Last year I only took four days off.
A broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to see his reports,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic to raise <0x24>365 billion
A total of nine operational programmes have been signed by Czech government ministers with representatives of the European Commission, out of which the Czech Republic can acquire <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion) in the coming years.
The Czech Republic can obtain about half of the total from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Around 125 billion kroons out of seven operational programmes will go to the regions.
Czech companies will receive around 100 billion kroons from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroons, goes to transport.
The Transport Program is the largest operating program and represents 22 percent of the funds available for the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state fund of the Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed with 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to gain assets for innovation enterprises.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in gaining funding from EU funds.
Nicaraguan ex-president sentenced to 20 years in prison
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday approved a 20-year prison sentence for former president Arnold Aleman, who was convicted in 2003 of <0x24>100 million (almost <0x24>1.8 billion) in financial fraud.
He was later released from prison and under house arrest in a hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country, between 1997 and 2002, will be returned to prison is still unclear, according to the AP news agency.
The President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez, said it would depend on the prison administration whether Aleman would be allowed to serve his sentence at home or whether he would go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government funds to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These fictitious corporations and their account numbers were in reality those of their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money was then spent at a foundation he founded in Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n to fund his 2001 election campaign.
Our budget has been approved.
That's right.
The state budget has been approved.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget prepared by this government, approved by a coalition majority, without the support of the opposition.
This year it passed with the support of the Social Democrats last year, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not allow the adoption of the no.
Unlike the debate before the vote about the distrust of the government, this time there was no drama.
The House of Representatives passed this generally disregarded, albeit most influential, law.
This is a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends at each chapter and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the struggles of the government and the opposition.
It’s more grateful in the press, that’s why it gets much more attention in the media.
The debates of politicians are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of past social democratic governments have faced three shortcomings, which the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high proportion of obligatory so-called employer expenditures, which include not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent "coalition" of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M before the elections
The second is deficit management as a consequence of the first deficiency.
The third limit is deficits in public funding, i.e. deficits in the budgets of cities and districts.
However, the biggest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
It is public and under comparative control.
Time bombs are budget deficits in cities and districts.
Many mayors could raise money for other investments besides taxes, duties and bank loans, and they often issued bonds with which their town halls were disproportionately indebted.
In recent years, these debts have been repaid through the mass sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks received from the State through privatisations.
They no longer have such a source.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we will determine that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth for some years now, which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting about.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the country is increasingly in debt.
The other countries, with one exception, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were much more rational than the Czech Republic.
This is a great disgrace for previous governments.
We are among the countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
Therefore, there is no need, for example, for huge social programs, which unfortunately have grown to a gigantic size in recent years, completely unnecessarily.
Although we have managed to eliminate some of the pointless populist spending approved before the elections this year, even if there is no extension of the retirement limit and pension reform in the near future, any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever governs will only be a matter of clericalism.
With a little exaggeration, from governing politicians, most of the money taxed tends to become pensioners and mechanical distributors of social benefits.
That is why this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the crowding-out of normal expenditure by client spending.
The <0x24>70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if previous governments had not squandered everything they could in the last decade.
If we do not want the government politicians to become mere officials, we must be patient and wish the coalition government, which is not too strong and knows that the state can only issue as much as it can obtain from taxes and duties, to prepare further reform laws.
This is the only way to achieve a balanced budget gradually.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to work together to combat the crisis in the financial markets.
The financial markets are thus costing more than <0x24>100 billion through the stock exchanges.
On these exchanges, interest rates are raised at the bank, for which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve puts <0x24>40 billion on the stock exchange and makes another twenty-four dollars available to the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time since the September 11 attacks, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This move should solve the biggest problems in the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl, a consultant at Economic Outlook Group, wrote in the report.
“Coordinated action by central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said.
Banks have already lost <0x24>60 billion, primarily in the United States, due to unrepaid loans.
Analysts expect further losses of billions.
“Central banks may indeed be afraid of what could happen if they chose such a procedure,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will also lend more expensive loans to their customers.
This would reduce demand and plunge the U.S. economy into recession with potential consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks decided to do so after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank lending rate, which is used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of reciprocal money lending, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain also lowered their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
"This will have a similar effect to further interest rate cuts," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that central bank intervention will contribute to resolving the crisis, as it will not solve the underlying problem of the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The Incredible Controversy of Ecologists
Global climate change is the biggest threat to developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus once again expressed his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time he criticized the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali.
The book Blue, presented in Vienna, not the green planet, said the debates among ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which consists of a particular mix of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompany it.
"The debate there is absolutely without structure, it is just a throwing of words, which are substitutes for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his theme was very important to him, which is why he is so committed to it.
He expressed satisfaction that the book was also published in German, because, as he said, “I often only see cartoons of my opinion.”
So now those interested can read your non-distorted opinion.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he believed that he had sufficient foundations to write such a book.
As an academic who is able to monitor and evaluate professional dissertations, he is experienced in statistics and also an economist.
The book concludes by stating that the climate is constantly changing, meaning that its changes are normal, and that not all scientists agree that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, so they do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective, and unacceptably costly.
Furthermore, as a person with experience in the field of totalitarianism, he considers the imposition of unproven opinions on others unacceptable, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
He repeatedly explained to the questions of those present that “it is not against the reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits.”
Klaus spoke about a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 were unable to exchange their licenses.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not replace their old driving licence in time, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when they can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driving licence in time for the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, 100,000 drivers will leave without a valid entitlement.
According to the authorities, the driver’s license was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the districts represented a sharp drop in interest in driving licence exchanges, the metropolitan authorities were flooded with applications for driving licence exchanges, which this week increased interest.
The mayor’s office receives about 2,000 clients per day.
You have to stand in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not exchanged their driver’s licenses.
A new driver's license is issued for 20 days.
However, a new driving licence can be applied for with a shortened deadline of five days.
However, in such a case, the driver will have to pay an additional 500 kroner.
Drivers who are unable to complete the compulsory driving licence exchange by the end of the year and leave with an invalid driving licence are threatened with a penalty from January.
The culprit must pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police may also settle the offence by agreement.
In the case of administrative offences, the penalty is 2500 kroner.
Based on previous information received from the City Hall, a fine may also be imposed on those who do not travel anywhere.
Supposedly, it can pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The ministry had previously called on the authorities to be lenient and to impose fines of up to 1,000 crowns.
According to Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, fines of tens of thousands do not threaten anyone.
A driver’s license is a document on which people can decide whether they want to or not.
This is not an identity card, which must be valid for everyone.
Those who no longer want to drive should give up their driving license.
It is enough to take it away or to send it by post to the appropriate office.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually replace other types of driving licences.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 can replace them for another three years.
Driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expire only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
Court Reduces Penalty for Investigators Associated with Berdyc
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, suspected of joining the criminal gang of David Berdych, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided on this with final effect, which reduced the sentences for one of them by one year and for the other by two years.
Investigators of the Prague Organized Crime Division were initially threatened by 14 and 12 years in prison.
There is no appeal against today’s decision, and a review can only be applied for at the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also suspected in this case, he is only awaiting a first-instance verdict.
In other cases, he was sentenced to more than 16 years in total.
You can't have any more.
In January, the County Court found 19 people guilty of participating in robbery attacks, of which 16 were appealed to the Supreme Court today.
The majority of the defendants dismissed the allegations from the start of the investigation as speculation.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, after the agreement with Berdyc, police members provided criminals with information from police sources, covered individual robbery attacks, and helped the gang avoid being prosecuted.
The gang therefore surrendered 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>.
The indictment is about the gang's crimes between 1999 and 2001.
These are mainly robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious damage to their health, but also abuse of public authority and unauthorised possession of weapons.
Because the police illegally held guns, steel-core projectiles, laser sightings or machine guns during house searches.
The gang is accused of stealing tens of millions of crowns from the robberies.
The nearly 20-member gang has already been convicted by the courts of Berdych's other robberies and many others.
Other members of Berdych's surroundings testify before the court in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The trial at first instance has so far avoided Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Puta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Account for child exchange: <0x24>12 million
Igor Veleba, the lawyer of the injured families, has demanded that the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital pay 12 million kroons in pain, plus court costs.
Three million for mothers, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The hospital’s legal representative, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l Veleba, basically disagrees with the proposal.
"We reject such a claim because it's too much," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's trial.
"In order to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert opinion developed by the opponent.
Find out if it has any usable value.
But we maintain our opinion that this will be measurable in hundreds of thousands for everyone,” Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for the four parents.
At the start of the case, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov family wanted a million crowns for every month that they had not raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba received expert criticism as the basis for the compensation negotiations, which was developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress of varying degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, even when they encountered such reproach that they did not prevent the newborn from switching.
Women are worse at coping with the actuality of the trauma they have experienced and what is happening right now, he summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola were exchanged by nurses at the obstetrics in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their birth parents - Nikola <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>kék in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, Veronika Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, head of the district of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, handed over 100,000 crowns to the families to replace their expenses due to the fault of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ské, which is controlled by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally covered by compulsory insurance.
In case of error, they must reach out to the reserve fund; in exceptional cases, they may seek the help of the founder.
Courts have so far approved relatively low compensation for people, calculated on the basis of tables of a few hundred thousand, and in exceptional cases a few million crowns.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost her kingdom in Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost his lawsuit for the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
According to the judge of the district court of Ostrava, although he first used the name King of Valachi, the project was developed by a team around the actor Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with many years of work.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team living on the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, in the words of the Valachi kingdom, everyone thinks of actor-comedy.
This view is shared by Harabish.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
Finding money and inventing actions," he said.
He thinks the reason for the dispute is money.
“Years later, they realized that the project was a success and they could gain something from it.
They want to take advantage of our work,” he added.
Profitable business
According to the court, the name "King of Valachi" was first used in Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's television program.
In 1993 Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> was crowned.
At the time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Valachi passports.
The original student coup operation turned into a business and lucrative entrepreneurship, on which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> founded the creation of a society in the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to include her name and signature on the passports, and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting her farm and theatre performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the idea, which Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka published in Manéss for the sake of his enterprise.
"The popularity of Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka for the Valachi Kingdom project must have helped," the judge said.
However, he added that the heart of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team.
The cooperation of the now-controversial parties continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation of Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, disputes have escalated between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, leading to the acquittal of the "forever-elected King Boleslav I".
At the initiative of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> took over the leading role in the kingdom as mother queen.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and others filed a lawsuit, which was dismissed by the court today.
The battle planned by Harabish could bring light to the dispute for the throne and half of the princess.
From this battle he should be a new king.
He did not want to give details and time yet.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be something like a royal march in Slov<0xC3><0xA1>cko.
The king should be elected for a limited period of time.
Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also speak," Harabish added.
Test of the 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: Disappearing prejudices
To be honest, I never liked the Peugeot 206.
Thread characteristics are nothing special, the quality of the shift, the driving and the production can often be marked as below average.
But its successor, the Peugeot 207, which is already on the market, is significantly better.
And the station wagon called SW goes one step further, so there's nothing left for me to do but think about it.
When I was testing the Peugeot 207’s classic hatchback, I complained, for example, about the space left for the head in the back seat.
This time the complaining is over here, because the bodywork of the combi means that even the two-meter-high giants will not suffer in this regard.
Fast in the world
I get through the interior quickly, so I don't repeat myself many times.
This is a relatively successful design, where my only objection is to the poor console.
I would appreciate a bit more designer inventions here if the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or armrests.
The side-driving performance of the 206 model has also been significantly improved.
As for the space, there is also an increase in the size of the body.
In the combi, the few spots of the head mentioned earlier disappear.
Suitcases in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to appreciate this being very accessible (due to the fold-out rear window) and spacious.
Empty spaces are equipped with lugs, which are ideal compromises.
They are not in the way, they can be disassembled and they can also carry heavier objects.
But let's stick to the volume a little bit.
This is based on the tables in the basic layout of 428 l, which is rather average compared to the competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, it is not the most sought-after vehicle of this class - compared to the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from mlad<0xC3><0xA1> boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is well behind the noticeably large 52 liters.
For holidays abroad or when placing a stroller, this value is almost critical.
But if I had to highlight the positives, then I have to mention the almost completely straight flooring after folding the backrests of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The vehicle we tested was equipped with a 1.6-litre four-cylinder ignition engine with a power of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what the 1,600 that drives the family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, low-consumption and primarily pulls.
If you compare it to the <0xC5><0xA0>KODA compliant, which often looks like a rag was stuffed into your exhaust, I can only rejoice in that.
The price is whispering
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we must remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car with a four-cylinder alien engine still goes for 329 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
The car starts from 410 990 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment throws an additional 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> at the equipment.
But we also had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper start, rear windows, electric remote control....
That is, the car with a case and a drawer costs 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
That’s a lot, but count the additional equipment of Fabia and get a very similar result.
There is no choice but to choose the brand.
Unsuccessful integration of Slovak students in British schools
The increasing number of children in British schools in Eastern Europe is raising concerns among locals about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between the children of immigrants and domestic residents have escalated into violence.
The problems of the integration of children in Eastern Europe are illustrated by a case in northern Kent, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensifying.
Disputes and quarrels between students are already characteristic of the parents’ relationships.
In Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit defends himself by saying that the boy insulted him with racist sentences.
The police also had to act after two twelve-year-old girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly insulted the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
“On our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he hit us with apples and pears and then revealed his naked ass,” the mother of the Slovak students wrote in a statement to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local residents described the disputes over Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants in British schools is starting to become tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks in the UK who are looking for a job.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
It is truly an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right one.
The golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm like a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters serving pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean islands, you can find it in a full and even richer list.
However, there is much more to be found on an island, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasure trove and transhipment site, which the Spaniards robbed in America and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
It was built by Lucky Luciano, one of the bosses of the U.S. mob, because everything that was considered a crime in the U.S. (primarily prohibition of alcohol) was welcomed in Cuba and promoted drugs, gambling, and prostitution.
Among his guests were
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings were built, and on the wide avenues cars were used as a cult symbol of the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and owned his own yacht in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar.
The walls of the Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with signatures of stars and politicians of American showbusiness.
What about today?
You can also sign the wall of the Bodeguita in Havana.
In the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, you will be offered a cocktail according to your wishes.
And the cult cars of the 1950s still run in Havana today, as the once exported carcasses and your son have long since rotted in this salty and humid air.
Although the oldest part of Havana has been significantly destroyed, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there.
Other places are also becoming more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides the money so much needed, its development has been given a green light.
In the past fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique delicacy in the world, which is especially appreciated by train enthusiasts.
From their extensive plantations, sugar cane was transported to sugar factories by steam and motor trains.
Their motor park has not been renewed for decades, so there are machines operating there, the contemporaries of which can only be seen in museums elsewhere.
Where to go?
The most famous places in Cuba are not avoided by the majority of visitors.
There is no need to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remind you that the aforementioned Hemingway estate has a museum, and anyone who loves the writer should not miss a visit to this museum.
Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from lime base.
Limestone formations, lime-mountain cones and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil has accumulated in their cavities, thanks to which the disintegrated cliffs are also covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be found during a visit to a cigar factory in Havana.
Some might also find it interesting that Major Zeman’s Chilean episode was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy took shape in the beauty and monumentality of the not-too-great city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, which was significantly influenced by the later French settlers, has changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the Escambray plain and the sea, is so secluded that even in the 1950s there were no roads connecting this region with the rest of the country.
That particular isolation helped him to remain an outsider.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't demolish it, everyone was glad they had a roof over their heads.
If you have more than an afternoon in Trinidad, it’s worth seeing some of the most interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n beach or the Sugar Factory Valley.
In the evening, you can go to Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which wakes up after dark, where the music is quiet only in the morning.
Baracoa
The city in the eastern part of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful city.
I am sure that this view is influenced by the road itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo have to overcome high and divided mountains, passing through nature that is barely affected by human activity.
The eastern landmark of Cuba has been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site due to its untouched nature.
It is here that the best chocolate is made, the church has the cross of Columbus (in fact, it was made a hundred years after Columbus’ voyage) and from the hill where the former castle stood and today stands the El Castillo Hotel, there are a few sign-mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Meastro plain, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Cuban patron saint of Caridad del Cobra, Santeria, the African religion professed by the descendants of former slaves, can be written about a lot.
As they say, it’s better to see it once in a while.
Afghan Allies Are Passive, Americans Say
A small number of soldiers and a lack of the necessary equipment also influence the course of the US mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said NATO should outline concrete plans for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not carried out as planned, the leaders of countries with units in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination of the Allies.
While the United States, with the help of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, called on NATO troops to be more active this week, Britain considers the strengthening of the Afghan government and the strengthening of development aid to be a priority.
“The development of Afghanistan is palpable, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the population to start their own further development of the economy and security," Des Browne, the British defense minister, told the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the U.S. government, the activity of Afghan rebels has been strongest in the past five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year and by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern region.
According to the United States, however, the Allies have also reached their borders in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were requested to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and ways to achieve them," <0xC5><0x99>ekl Gates said.
In a similar spirit, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
“I’m not happy with what’s on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
“We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters news agency at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there have also been debates among the participating countries about whether allies in Afghanistan offer the maximum.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are present in a relatively large number in Afghanistan.
However, they were deployed in areas with the least violence and combat requirements, so they are not as high against them as they are against us in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid newspaper Sun called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"The Afghan snitches have been exposed: The Germans are playing while our sons are fighting," Sun wrote in a photo of the German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild counterattacked and published a photo of a British team’s rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The public debt will reach one trillion in 2009.
Each Czech Republic has a debt of 84,000 kroons.
By the end of September, total debt had reached 842.7 billion kroons.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion kroons this year.
By the beginning of December, however, the ministry had reduced this plan by 152.8 billion kroner, thanks to better development of the state budget.
At the end of September, the Czech Republic’s public debt reached 842.7 billion kroons.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroons.
As of June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion kroons.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its government debt figures from the beginning of October.
Each Czech Republic owes more than 84,000 kroner.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion kroons.
“At the moment, it seems that due to the lower deficit next year, we could only exceed the one trillion crown limit in 2009.
Next year, the debt will be around 900 billion and a trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Next Finance analyst Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora says: “We can cross the one trillion mark in 2009.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget, which is currently unknown.
If it were proven that the situation in the field of politics would change, politicians would be willing to save more, this could be postponed until 2010.
But I don't assume that change," he said.
Growing Debts
Government debt consists of central government debt, which is formed primarily by accumulating government budget deficits.
Government debt is financed through treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s internal indebtedness has so far increased by 38.5 billion kroons to 719.4 billion kroons this year.
The state’s foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroons.
The so-called negotiable government debt reached 803.3 billion kroons by the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion kroons from June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"Full-year debt has increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is actually quite a lot compared to the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by bonds, where the increase is 20%.
It’s bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that you’ll have something to trade with when the pension reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
According to the financing strategy and the management of the public debt in 2007, the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroons this year.
By the beginning of December, however, the ministry had reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroner, thanks to better development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion kroons instead of the assumed 91.3 billion kroons this year.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency is planning a maximum source of SEK 13.3 billion, a provision of 10 billion to pay pensions, the financing of SEK 43 billion in government bonds and the repayment of SEK 1.8 billion in loans from the European Investment Bank.
Teacher appears today in court in Khartoum over name given to teddy bear
A court in Khartoum on Thursday sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and expulsion from the country for violating Islam, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her six- to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Mohammed, but Islam prohibits any representation of her prophet.
Such an act is punishable by scourging.
The 54-year-old British woman, who is a teacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested in her own apartment on Sunday. Under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, she was accused of violating Islam and rebelling after her parents repeatedly filed complaints against her with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
"The children proposed eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," said Robert Boulos, the school's director.
In the end, 20 out of 23 children voted for Muhammad.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Prophet of Islam, but he is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a diary together with the teddy bear's photo and the inscription "My name is Muhammad."
The bear itself was not labeled with this name, but the problem is that any representation of the prophet is a violation of Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who taught at the same school, said that she knew him well and that the teacher would never have done anything that would offend any religious beliefs. According to him, it was just an "innocent mistake": "I only regret having the children vote for the name."
Many of her students agree with this view, saying that the teacher is "very good with children" and "never talks about religion in class."
Remember that Muhammad is also the second most popular first name in the UK, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of showing honor to the prophet. (It is often the name given to the first-born child of the family.)
What are the rules for using a first name?
Can you name a game, for example?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement at Wednesday’s last meeting in Vienna on the future status of the province.
The end result: failure.
The sixth and final discussion between the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the separatist province ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not reached an agreement on status," EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region was “at stake” and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the talks.
"There is no need to fear violence in the near future, but it is going to be a very difficult time," he added, stressing the "existence of obvious tensions."
The mediation will end on December 10
On Monday, Serbia and Kosovo will be visited for the last time by the mediation troika, which includes the European Union, the United States of America and Russia.
The future of the 90% Albanian-populated province could be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Harchenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The meeting in Baden near Vienna was the sixth and final meeting of the talks since the UN commissioned another mediation to the troika last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation mission will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already frustrated Kosovo’s independence in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond the deadline.
"Russia has been committed and will remain committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise," Bocan-Harchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN control over Kosovo, the Western powers believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was ready to declare her independence unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide in her favor.
Belgrade will continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement," Kosovo's independent province president Fatmir Sejdiu said at a hotel in Baden where "last chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the Kosovo uprising and future prime minister of the province, also expressed regret.
However, he added that Belgrade’s vision of autonomy would be “a continuation of the past that leads to murders and deportations”.
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo about the consequences of the unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is afraid of the domino effect in an area that is still unstable due to the independence wars of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of a compromise," Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where the Russian ally has a veto.
“The Kosovo parliament will have the last word.”
"For Serbia, only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“The negotiations have been going on for two years.
They have to end where they started: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that “the Kosovo parliament will have the last word”, adding that the unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians is based on “reconciliation” with the Western powers.
Bush urges agreement between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush announced on Tuesday at the opening of his international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have agreed to start talks immediately with their peoples to resolve the 60-year-old dispute.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush promised to support them in every possible way in signing the "peace treaty" in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist networks” and Israel must stop its colonial activities, Bush said, and reminded the two sides of their commitments to the “roadmap for peace” adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the goal of the Abbas-led talks between the Palestinian Authority and Israel was “to sign a peace treaty that resolves all pending issues, including central issues.”
The latter concern three delicate issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the situation in Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees who were displaced from their homes during the 1948 conflict and who lived on the territory of the present-day state of Israel.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that future negotiations should be “global and in-depth” and cover all areas of regulation, including “Jerusalem, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security.”
Olmert then promised that future negotiations would be "indirect and continuous" and that he would seek to "finalise them in 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush had set out to realize the "two-state vision" of the Palestinians and Israelis who co-existed.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was considered a success by Washington, with the support of all Arab countries, initiated a plan to guarantee peace for Israel if it withdrew from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis “is a choice in the history of the Middle East, especially because it grasps the problem at its root and focuses on central issues,” the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with this kind of news, the official position and the rumor contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation launched by the IGPN, a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 5 p.m.
"The car was patrolled, so it wasn't in action. It was running at 40-50 km/h, without sirens," a police source said.
The two young men without helmets were driven at "high speed" with a green, "not officially registered, so it can't be used in road traffic" (see below) Kawasaki branded engine.
"Since the right-hand rule was not followed, the engine hit the left side of the police car," one police officer said.
The results of the alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle were negative.
The strength of the collision is well illustrated by the fact that the front of the car is deformed, the windscreen is cracked in the form of a star, and the bumper is torn off.
Pontoise’s Attorney General, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, said in an emergency announcement yesterday morning that she had commissioned the IGPN and the Val-D’Oise County Public Safety Directorate to investigate “due to negligent manslaughter and failure to provide assistance.”
During the afternoon, the prosecutor said at a press conference that at the current stage of the IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police officers could be excluded.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses interrogated in the accident on Sunday night confirmed “police reports that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car.”
Yesterday, from a strip, no doubt drawn by footrests on the road, it was shown that the two vehicles had collided and traveled together for a while until the police car managed to curb it.
Vehicles were seized for technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were examined by a medical examiner yesterday.
What happened immediately after that?
A rumor spread in Villiers-le-Bel yesterday that policemen had left the scene quickly without helping the two young people.
The IGPN is cautious about this, but excludes any “serious mistake” by the police.
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires a more thorough investigation and greater caution in doing so," police sources said.
Libération met with an eyewitness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment looks exactly at the location.
“My cousin, a hospital nurse, and I immediately went downstairs to try to resuscitate them,” the witness said.
"There's nothing we could do."
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and lame.
The other two tried to resuscitate one of the youngsters, and the fourth called.”
Tensions among the attendees increased as the hopeless situation of the two young people became apparent, so the arriving police took their colleagues away by car.
We also know from the eyewitness’s statement that the ambulance arrived “about 20 minutes after the police left.”
Heart massage was also used, but in vain.
“I wouldn’t say the police didn’t try to help the young people.
The young people have been helped.
The firefighters arrived at the scene immediately.
"They did everything they could to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police prevented the first demonstrations after the emergency imposed by General Musharraf two days earlier.
Witnesses say about 2,000 lawyers in Lahore, the eastern part of the country, have been wounded by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement forces in protest against the measures put in place during the state of emergency.
In response, they threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were created.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and wounded lawyers.
More people were produced.
In Islamabad, registered lawyers at the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced protests over the arrests of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the gathering.
Several protests took place in Multan and Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the lawyers' movement has also been supported by the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance of religious parties. His leader "urged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency, and garbage to those who took an oath before Musharraf."
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, the Court will have to rule on the legitimacy of President Musharraf’s re-election by indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
"Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings," the president told The News.
President Pervez Musharraf’s promise to leave the army to assume the role of civilian president was “lost after the state of emergency,” information minister Tariq Azeem said Monday.
Musharraf had to resign from the military uniform until November 15, the end of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has refuted rumours across the country that Musharraf’s deputy general would have appointed a place of forced residence.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned
This results in unwanted (24%) and improperly or unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than a third (36%) of pregnancies are unplanned, according to a study by the French National Institute of Demography (Ined), 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalizes contraception.
This results in unwanted (24%) and improperly or unplanned pregnancies.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception, such as the pill or the uterine spiral, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made “birth control” more effective. The study notes that in 1970, only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 took contraceptive pills, but today the figure is 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
One in five plans with a few months of accuracy, and if possible, for spring, as this is the most favorable season for the adoption of a child.
Spectacular repairs at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to carry out a spectacular repair of a tear-down solar panel, essential to the station’s scientific activity.
This dangerous spacewalk proved to be a record in many ways: the repair took a very long time, there was very little time to plan it, and it had to be done away from the residential modules with tools "hand-crafted" by astronauts.
The problem occurred on Tuesday, when astronauts disconnected the Harmony module from the Discovery. It is a giant cylindrical element that will soon be the site of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, their power supply must be taken care of.
The second task of the crew was therefore to relocate one of the modules, which was already on the ISS, to its final position, producing electricity with the help of 17.5 tons of solar panels.
The crew then began to open the 76-metre-wide solar panels of the module.
One of the harmonica-like folding boards was then damaged by a clamped cable about one meter in length.
In order to avoid further damage, the board was not opened.
Initially, the mission of the astronauts was to take a control walk from the Discovery shuttle and then repair another solar panel with a faulty rotation system. Instead, they had to devote their full time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to do the stunt by hanging on the space shuttle's 30-metre robot arm attached to the station's crane.
He's one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
He is tall, strong, extremely skillful, has a muscular upper body and long arms.
A 46-year-old man with a doctor’s degree had to “operate” the “damaged” solar panel.
After thoroughly assessing the damage caused, he cut the faulty cable and fastened the damaged area with a few "rails".
He was assisted by another "spacewalker" who remained near the safe passage, as well as other astronauts inside, including the crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick, which was insulated against hundreds of volts of solar panels, was invented and "crafted" by the station's astronauts.
After completing the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for his companions to fully open the board, and only then packed up his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day break, and today seven of them returned to the Discovery space shuttle to begin their planned return home on Wednesday.
Decrease in EADS shares
The price of EADS shares on the Paris stock exchange fell sharply after the aircraft and defense equipment company announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft would result in an additional cost of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion.
The price of EADS shares is currently <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96 after a 4% decrease.
The company was forced to revise its forecasts for operating profit for 2007, as the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which is likely to delay the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in delivering the aircraft, announced in October, "will cost between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion, of which more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion will affect Airbus," EADS's parent company said in a statement.
Due to these expenses, EADS will have to announce new plans for its operating profit for 2007 next Thursday, when it announces its quarterly results, the company added, but did not disclose any further figures.
The Group also indicated that it took the six-month delay into account when preparing its new cost estimation.
In 2006, EADS’ operating profit decreased by 86%, largely due to a delay in the development of another program, the A380, which also placed a heavy financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to hand over the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
Remains a status quo
Sunday’s elections are not a big surprise: the vast majority of Russians will vote for Putin’s party, United Russia.
This shows the Russians’ need for stability, to say arbitrary governance, after a heavily manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is addressing the electorate via a televised message via public service channels, which has already been recorded, but its content is still secret.
Putin leads the list of candidates for the Kremlin support party, United Russia, which is expected to win an overwhelming election.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the behavior of the head of state did not reveal anything: he only launched another outburst against the interventions of Western countries, which was a favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections, without any violations,” he said.
According to the opposition, this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, in which they say they have exerted pressure on voters.
Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, said that “there were no such dirty elections in Russia even during Yeltsin’s time.”
After defeating the protests last weekend, former World Chess Champion Garri Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized protests, and his lawyer says he is still not allowed to visit.
“The Russians still think of themselves as ‘homo sovieticus’”
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
Who will follow Putin in the head of state?
The first round of the presidential election, which will take place on 2 March 2008, has been published in the Official Gazette, and the candidates will be able to announce their intention to run until 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his term of office can no longer be extended.
There are no other survivors in sight.
What role will Putin play in March?
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or will he, as the leader of the almighty United Russia Party or the parliamentary majority, decide on the government and the president?
Whatever happens, the outgoing power will win both the parliamentary and presidential elections.
It has now become a tradition.
“The Russians are still thinking like ‘homo sovieticus’: they don’t feel they can control their fate,” said Lev Gudkov, sociologist and director of the independent Levada Center.
Nikolai Koposov, a historian at the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later than in Europe, so the development of civil society is also delayed.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin went back to the paternalist model, which suited the people perfectly. All the more so because this new form of paternalism did not involve intimidation, but a certain degree of economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Nowadays, the Russians "willingly reject personal responsibility," which quickly manifested itself after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
This phenomenon affects all segments of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the status quo: the local lists of Unified Russia are led by 65 governors from 85 regions of Russia.
And freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
The Russians do not vote for extremist parties.
Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why should we replace them?”
Depressing Memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive became public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archive documents, which occupy 27 kilometers of shelving in Bad Arolsen in the province of Hessen, have so far been searchable only for “humanitarian” purposes, providing unique and name-based insights for former victims or their descendants.
Eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archive for researchers and historians in May 2006.
After all the states ratified the treaty, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the archives in Bad Arolsen will allow historians to conduct research on “the relocation of prisoners, camp residents and the health of forced laborers,” explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the disclosure of the documents because they contain names and thus confidential information.
For example, some deportees may have alleged homosexuality or mental disabilities.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo began to be collected after the war for practical reasons, with the aim of locating civilians who were deported or sentenced to forced labour, and possibly providing evidence of their internment, on the basis of which they could receive compensation.
Currently, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are processing tens of thousands of unique needs.
However, some scholars do not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive of paramount importance.
"These documents are basically nothing new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Center at the Berlin University of Technology in 2006.
EU and India to sign free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s leading trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath announced.
The EU foreign ministers already approved in April last year that the European Commission should initiate negotiations on the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s leading trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India’s main foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s 9th most important trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
Peter Mandelson said a free trade agreement “could have an economic stimulus for both parties” and that “India could increase its presence in a booming market with a population of 450 million.”
At the top of India’s ten most important exports, Europe is the primary or secondary importer, the European Commissioner added. The two giants, Europe and Asia, each year exchange “a product worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion” and “a service worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 billion”, said the president of the European Commission, Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Smadja, at the EU Commission’s delegation in New Delhi this week. At the same time, he expressed regret at the fact that the bilateral trade

Bank of England Offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 Billion to Financial Markets for Five Weeks
The Bank of England has announced on Thursday that it will pump <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion into the financial market, with a base rate of 5.75% and a five-week maturity.
“We want to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to be able to plan their liquidity positions with greater certainty for this period. Therefore, from 6 December, the Bank will offer a significant part of its reserves in the international financial market through a five-week open market operation,” the bank said in a press release.
According to the bank’s announcement, <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be released on 6 December at 12:15 local time. The offer is subject to the central bank’s base rate and the repayment deadline is 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks under an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release, the Bank of England said it was "ready to take further steps" to ensure interbank loans were aligned with the central bank's base rate.
The current interbank interest rate on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate was above the level of September 18, at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the Bank of England has charged significant penalty interest on the sums pumped into the financial market, which has discouraged banks from using them.
Rumor has it that many people would have preferred the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which would have been available at a more favourable interest rate and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre group on Thursday declined to discuss articles on the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the Socialist-initiated meeting included about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the Socialist Party, including a 50% increase in the employment surcharge, the reintroduction of a variable fuel tax, the introduction of a travel cheque and restrictions on rents.
As the UMP and NC voted 180:115 against reviewing the articles, the talks between the ruling party and the opposition, which sometimes resulted in sharp debates, were finally interrupted, just a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that he would resubmit all of his group’s proposals within the framework of the amendment of the corrective draft financial law, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
There have been a lot of rumours about the new Philadelphia music festival to be organized by C3 Presents, but now the company that organizes and promotes the event has announced that the Vineland music festival will be held in New Jersey in cooperation with British producer Melvin Benn’s company, Festival Republic.
“We are honored to be working with someone who is the founder of today’s American festival movement,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 also hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The New Jersey Vineland Festival will be held in the summer, so there will be opportunities for camping.
The festival will take place between August 8 and 10, on a 500-acre private property about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival Republic director Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most respected festival organizers in the world.
In 1989, he began organizing the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded his palette by organizing the Leeds Festival, and in 2006, the Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Melvin Benn has been a co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
C3 co-founder Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival "the most inspiring event he has ever attended." He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
“We’ve chosen the Philadelphia venue before, and we’ve worked hard together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to host this festival in downtown Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
"We have had a discussion with the city and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, because of the city’s political maneuver, the organization has failed,” said Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to talk to Melvin Benn about this, and now we're preparing to host a huge festival in another unique venue that will ultimately serve the interests of the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago’s Grant Park in 2005, after demonstrating his exceptional festival organizing talent with the Austin City Limits music festival in 2002.
The two events generated gross revenues of <0x24>9.8 million and <0x24>11.3 million in 2007.
Both festivals were held in urban locations.
“Melvin Benn’s European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to somehow combine the two models and create both the rural atmosphere in Europe and the sense of urban life in America.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The people of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiastic about the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he says that “the conditions are favourable enough to allow investment in such an event at a location that hopefully will host the festival for a long time.”
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be “gigantic” in size, with a capacity roughly equivalent to the capacity of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
The bands have already been invited to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
"Vineland is basically a rock festival, but we're planning a variety of music offerings so everyone can find what they like," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Att, together form the C3 company, which received the award of "Best Independent Event Manager" at the latest Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal to face Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator himself...
Seduction is one of the missions of the Montreal delegate.
The mission promises to be “politically difficult” as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the "Terminator Governor"?
“We have to be careful because the film industry decides for itself which is the best venue for it.
If you find the conditions in Montreal favorable, you will go there.
It’s our job to offer the best possible conditions for them to choose for us,” says Schwarzenegger.
Competing for festivals
But Denis Turcotte is now focused on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The aim is to present and promote as many Québec films as possible at every American film festival, be it the Sundance Film Festival, the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The film L'<0xC3><0x82>ge des tén<0xC3><0xA8>bres was well received at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will also be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil will be screened in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also featured four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally on the stock market? Experts share the opinion of the "subprime" crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their hands and can’t wait for the usual end of the year.
This year, however, it is not clear to the experts whether this will happen.
According to Banif, “from a statistical point of view, the stock market generally behaves positively in December.
However, forecasts based solely on statistics are not necessarily correct and, in the current situation, the market is characterised by uncertainty, at least in the short term.”
Experts are far from favoring the stock market’s buoyancy at the end of the year, although they state that “the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, which gives an opportunity to invest as there are no guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed returns, which are negatively impacted by escaping to high-quality securities, both in the long and short term.”
As a result, they say the stock market will be characterised by lateral movements that are not free of volatility, "especially as the impact of the Fed interest rate cut is not yet known, because the price of crude oil is high and there is also a threat of inflationary tension."
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees, saying it would be risky to say that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, “the situation is not rosy at all.”
Ibex lost nearly 4 percent compared to its highest level recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7.
Despite this, not all experts are so pessimistic.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana said the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points due to a reorganization of the portfolios and contributions to the usual retirement fund.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally will be postponed to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Constitutional Day.
The analyst considers that volatility is unlikely to influence market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said: “We are close to the technical level and we are seeing a decline in the stock market index, which could rise depending on news from the US regarding the consequences of the credit market crisis.”
The analyst is confident that they will be favorable.
Analysts agree on what securities will be used to reach the new maximum quotas for Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that “this year it’s the big securities that are in the lead.”
The expert would add the two major banks and some construction companies to the list, "because by then the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco says the rise is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
For construction companies, the rally can also be positive, of course, if there will be any.
"ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that both Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow this path," he said.
Cyclical consumption will be the main focus for the remainder of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also benefit, although the representation in this area is not very high on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have been only two exchange rate drops in December.
The actual year-end rally was observed in 2003, when the stock markets recovered from the crisis caused by the burst of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 corrected 28.17 percent back, a jump of 6.68 percent was recorded in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (currently Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally will take place.
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol 200 opens a 12-hour account from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol has decided to renovate most of its accounts.
This concerns a total of 200 branches located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and bring a big change to the bank.
But also for other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group whose branches are open continuously until 8.30 p.m. and even on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated that it plans to extend the opening hours of its accounts, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, he is currently working on an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his accounts in exchange for opening one afternoon, though not to the public.
The experiences of Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol will be crucial for the other institutions, as they will decide on whether to join the initiative to improve the opening hours of the shops.
This is the goal of the Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol project.
I would like to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, sole proprietors and local businesses shopping in these places.
The bank wants to operate 200 branches across Spain with the aforementioned opening hours for 18 months, as it is not about a new opening hours, but about a remodeling of the existing one.
To do this, the institution modernizes its branches in commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of opening hours is accompanied by a new idea of the character of the drawers, a more modern, colorful design.
Commercial banker <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera points out that the reorganization does not require much investment, but requires more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The branches, in which even meeting rooms for SMEs will be located, will also sell non-financial products.
Favorable experiences
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol has already implemented the initiative in its three branches in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero said the experience was positive.
The choice was made for branches in Madrid’s Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a streets, and Rivero said the decision was right.
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, and also has very favorable opening hours, even opening on Sundays and holidays.
The above-mentioned units of PopularMax do not use the BBVA model, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our customers," Rivero points out.
At the moment, they have managed to reach an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica and will sell mobile phones with the help of external personnel.
Telecinco to double the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
"We did it."
At the closing of the market yesterday, Paolo Vasile, Telecinco’s consultant, expressed his satisfaction when it was revealed that the television station he led had doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Yet one thing overshadowed her joy: “It only hurts that it’s not because we’ve risen more, but because we’ve fallen less.”
Still, he emphasized that in the weak market, we “falled less.”
Telecinco closed yesterday with a 2.54 percent increase.
This increase puts your annual loss at 15.66 percent.
The company owns 52% of Mediaset and 13% of Vocento, making it worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
His rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52% yesterday and has recorded a 40.5% drop since January, so yesterday it was half as much as 2,193.46 million.
The other listed communications companies are worth 3,571 million for Sogecable, 2,518,53 million for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to similarities between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can deliver in the same market, at what cost, and how it pays off in terms of viewing.
Telecinco announced last week that it would like to be the first television channel with a gross advertising revenue of over <0x24>1 billion this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, a consultant for Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s advertising subsidiary.
If the reported fact is realized, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6 percent this fiscal year, compared to the 965.4 million in 2006.
Antena 3’s net sales increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to 734.4 million), while TV’s net sales increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
Analysts say one of the factors driving Telecinco’s stock market momentum is the high payout that has been maintained so far: in 2006, the company, headed by President Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, distributed 100% of its returns to its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this rate could change after buying 33% of Endemol in partnership with its parent company, Mediaset.
"We officially guarantee a minimum of 50% payout, although we have always distributed a lot more.
I hope our shareholders will be happy with us this year, as we have already favored them with the acquisition of 33 percent of Endemol.”
Analysts say the market is currently experiencing some decline.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its yield estimates for Telecinco by 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the fact that the estimated growth in revenue will decrease from 10.5 percent to 8.4 percent in 2008 and from 5.5 percent to 5.1 percent in 2009.
The same company forecasts that Antena 3’s profits will decline by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.

1.
Ibersecurity: recommends the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high profitability and long-term sustainable potential of dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco as more favorable (acquisition) than Antena 3 (retention) due to its "multiple attractiveness" and business strength.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends underestimating due to "similar risks" (saturated market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves takeover of MiFID that entered into force on November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary process, which ended today with a congressional vote approving the Senate amendments, the government initiated a social dialogue on the legislation underpinning the law so that both could come into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups unanimously underlined the efforts of the MPs and senators in negotiations and agreements aimed at developing the most favourable normatives to protect investors, as well as the detailed regulation of the activities of the companies, in order to operate effectively in the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, will enable the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, expanding the supervisory powers of the Spanish National Securities Markets Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between different supervisors in the European Union.
The new directive will enable financial advisory services to be provided to specialised companies, but also to natural or legal persons, as well as to securities distribution companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, by creating a new form of financial services company (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFIs).
In addition, the law will increase the number of systems capable of carrying out operations involving funds, thereby adding to the regulated secondary markets the multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems for the execution of orders, which will compete with current stock market participants.
In addition, the Act requires investment firms to provide market information on the defining aspects of their business profile, their risk-taking and risk-management methods, and to keep records of all operations carried out in order to facilitate the control of CNMV.
A number of amendments have been introduced by the Congressional Economic Commission. Of these, it is of paramount importance that securitised debts are treated as "complex" funds due to the high risk they pose to the investor. This has been proven in the context of the US high-risk mortgage lending (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally outline the scope of activity of those with economic and entrepreneurial qualifications, 30 years after the Royal Decree, which defined the professional functions that could be carried out only by economists, came into force in 1977.
The Senate, in turn, proposed the creation of new actors in the financial sector, such as an agent for an intermediary who works for someone else’s account, does not need permission from CNMV, and can market products or acquire clients for several investment companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November, reaching 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its publication is in line with Eurostat’s and the European Central Bank’s strategy to provide data that are comparable with data from the United States, both in terms of time and nature.
The preliminary indicator is calculated using the same method as for the calculation of the Consolidated Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs for the estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of disclosure.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator is purely indicative and may therefore deviate from the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to show a relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, one of the vice-presidents of the government and the Minister of Economic Affairs, said the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was "temporary" but predicted that the price index would continue to show "relatively high" in the coming months.
In the corridors of Parliament, Mr Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not very favourable, the inflation rate in Spain within the monetary union has remained more or less at the same level in recent years."
He added that the month of November brought “less surprises” than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the Minister of Economic Affairs acknowledged in connection with the data released today.
Northern Rock wants Virgin to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion in three years.
Northern Rock’s deposits have declined by more than 50% and currently amount to only <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to borrow urgently from the Bank of England.
At the time, it still had a record number of deposits of over <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, the number of which has gradually declined over the past two and a half months due to a loss of customer confidence, despite the government’s promise of a hundred percent guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial and commercial name, Virgin Money, and will have to earn about a quarter of British bank revenues over the next three years in order to earn the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
Richard Branson, a prominent businessman known for his advertising campaigns in England, intends to spend around <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing in order to achieve this goal.
Northern Rock this week highlighted the Virgin Consortium's offer as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
Totana Mayor Arrested for Alleged Corruption
The police arrested the mayor of the village of Totana (People's Party) in the province of Murcia at dawn on suspicion of being involved in a city corruption scandal this week.
In addition, one of the town’s secretaries and the town’s police chief were arrested.
The former city council member José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo took the place of EPP member Juan Morales in May, who, according to official authorities interviewed by the SER radio station, may have been the head of the corruption network.
The police continue to investigate the city’s offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales’ lawyer has also been investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal this week.
According to the SER radio station, Juan Morales' lawyer was arrested while he was leaving Morales with the corruption documentation in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 acres of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of PSOE in Toledo and his position as Speaker of Parliament if he wins the election.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary General of the Socialist Party José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero to lead the PSOE’s Toledo list in the next parliamentary elections and to chair the parliament if the Socialists win the election.
This was announced by PSOE Organization Secretary José Blanci at a press conference and confirmed by Bono himself at the party’s federal headquarters after a meeting with Zapatero this afternoon.
The Prime Minister justified his choice of the former minister by saying that “we have to count on the best in politics” and Bono is “one of the best”.
He added that “probably” the Mancha politician will be the Socialist party’s candidate for the presidency of Parliament if the Socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace the current President of Parliament Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, who announced on 15 November that he did not intend to run for office in the next elections and, giving up his political career, would instead fight against climate change in academia.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister had been besieging him constantly to return to the political scene since he gave up active politics two years ago.
He added that since voters are aware of who will be the vice-president of the economy in the event of the Socialists’ victory, the party would also like to inform them, “in the spirit of transparency,” about who will be the President of Parliament.
If Bono is to fill the post, he would like Parliament to be a "scene of respect and not insult or shouting" and more like the home of the citizens.
“Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to talk quietly, it has happened that the Prime Minister’s speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate.”
At the same time, he praised the current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, for his “excellent work,” but he did not want to present himself as president already, lest his opponents consider him “superficial.”
Campaign for the climate
Because the climate change movement is relentlessly persecuting both those who are skeptical of their predictions and those who prefer political or social battles, it must be very strong.
In fact, he must also support a political leader such as Prime Minister Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and declares that “we need to conclude a new agreement with our Earth”.
However, this remark raises the question to what extent the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to Spain’s leading position within the EU in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance with the Convention, which sectors are affected, and why has the Government not tried to avoid this?
In addition, it should clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it intends to take to contain climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits will the population have to change, what level of energy saving will we expect at individual and social level, and what economic consequences will this have?
So who has to sacrifice and who has to pay to save our planet?
But we have not and will not get an explanation for these questions.
That's because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has brought about measures, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and costly for both companies and the general public.
Even PSOE’s gasoline price increase would have been so unpopular before the election that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That is, we must save the Earth from nothing, with mere propaganda texts, empty slogans, free of real consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With the agreement with the Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, and even beautifies the election assemblies and awakens tenderness in us.

Totana Mayor and Chief of Police Arrested for Alleged Corruption
The police have arrested the mayor of Totana, Murca Province, the EPP-ED José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the local police chief, the City Hall secretary and a catering contractor for crimes related to urban development, police sources have informed today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and transferred to the City Hall, and he is still there with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the City Development Council and the municipal body responsible for the management of Industrial Settlements and Apartments.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrests of six people in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia last Monday in connection with a case in which two hectares of agricultural land were converted into built-in land to allow the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes after illegally paying commissions to managers during their previous mandate.
Two other people have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation, according to the 1st court in Totana.
The first six people arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, Juan Morales, former mayor of Totana, who is now an independent MP of the People’s Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as is the former mayor’s current girlfriend, who lives in the provincial centre of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and contractor Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), along with the director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G., who also belongs to the Nuaria Group and through whom the bribes were carried out.
The investigation is carried out by a group of officers of the Operational Central Unit of the Police charged with crimes at municipal level, whose members, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, mainly at companies related to the arrested, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry company in the area, who may have played a mediation role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential complex in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which has been reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the settlement with a current population of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, real estate broker, Conycase in Vigo, who is responsible for the management of the Coruna, Venezuela streets and parking spaces at the Catholic Ferdinand Square, Hogartel, who specializes in direct marketing, and Preconiza, who sells, promotes and installs building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent found this commentary in one of Finland’s largest daily newspapers: (probably at the head of the PISA report on the world’s cultural level) in Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what appeared on November 18 at the same time as Blackburn’s criticism of his book.
“The philosophical teachings came to the public after the tragedy of the Jokela high school.
The killer, a graduating student, quoted in his messages the writings of Plato and Nietzsche.
Education Counselor Pekka Elo, responsible for teaching philosophy, called for teachers to take a critical look at Plato’s teachings in Helsingin Sanomat, adding that Nietzsche’s knowledge is not necessarily important in the compulsory elementary philosophy classes of secondary schools.

One of your colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code contains the following offences related to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is considered an offence and is punishable from six months to one year.
However, stealing a disc with a value of less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 in a store is a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you are stealing in a shop for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is still less than the penalty for downloading from the Internet (Art. 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car but return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still less than the penalty for downloading it online (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get involved in a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you participate in a mass shooting, you may be sentenced to between three months and one year (Art. 154 BTK), and between six months and two years for copying a CD.
(Article 270 BTK).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD movie.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the consent of the authors is more severely punishable than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).

My GP gave me an article about strange research, which read: “Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it.”
That is, employees’ feelings on a payday depend on how much others received.
The experiment was carried out at the University of Bonn by measuring magnetic resonances with a tomograph, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, head of the Neurocognition Group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, “We measured the strongest activity when the participant answered correctly and the partner made a mistake.”
The researchers found that if they both gave the right answer and received the same amount of cash rewards, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received double the amount, the activity also increased.
I have no idea why such great science was needed for such a simple conclusion.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court in The Hague, which investigates crimes committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
His term of office expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter taste, as those responsible for the Srebrenica massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and Bosnian leader Radov<0xC3><0xA1>n Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list chosen by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as the title of his documentary: Carla's List (2006, unreleased in Spain). Like a real crime, the film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as he tries to put pressure on the governments involved to squeeze the loop around the fugitive culprits.
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which means safety for the owner of the car in the face of various damage events, entails significant costs and depends on a number of factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and type of use.
Buying a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car you want.
First of all, we need to be clear about what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurer.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company undertakes compensation for the fixed premium in the event of an incident.
In practice, the premium is the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining a driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured, its use, and more.
Insurance companies determine the insurance premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. a higher amount is paid by the person who represents a higher risk of accidents.
That’s why people over the age of 25 or women pay less because, according to statistics, they’re less risky because they’re more cautious.
Similarly, according to the reports, insurance companies concluded that married people cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
The frequency of use of the car is decisive.
With more frequent use, the chance of an accident increases.
When determining the premium, insurance companies take into account a number of factors.
Therefore, the owner should carefully look into it so that he can choose the most suitable form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we present the most important factors for choosing, so that we can best adapt to the insurer’s needs and create an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under the age of 25 face a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and the freshness of their driving license.
Although it is ideal to be insured against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers can take out complete insurance on their own, so they can be insured against all dangers and the price will be affordable.
In this type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
"The amount of the self-contributor to the insurer depends on the insurance premium; the higher the premium, the lower the self-contributor," says Luis Noguera, head of First Europe's online insurance intermediary in Spain.
Another option is extended third-party liability insurance, where the customer insures himself against damage to others, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it will be insured against theft, fire damage and loss of the car.
A word of advice.
If you are under the age of 25, be careful and avoid accidents as this will affect the bonus and reduce the amount you will have to pay in the future.
A bonus is a discount on the basic rate of the insurance company.
The penalty charged in relation to the basic tariff is called a malus.
“The amount of the bonus and the amount of the bonus depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to raise the bonus,” Noguera explains.
If the age of 25 has already been exceeded, it is easier for owners to take out adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents decreases due to the experience gained over the years.
We recommend that you take out full insurance.
"Usually, young people are not yet able to apply their experience to accidents, or even to driving," says the director of the European Insurance Company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when drivers have already overcome the fear of a beginner.
If the insured person is already married but has no children, it is best to take out full insurance, of course, if your financial possibilities allow.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the least risky clients, so the premium is also lower in their case.
In this case, it is best to have full insurance on your own (it can reach 300 euros), or if they have a higher bonus, they can extend the insurance from the third year of the vehicle to cover the damage caused to someone else.
“They drive more calmly, but at the same time they have more purchasing power and can afford to have a higher share,” Noguera said.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend the full insurance on own account (which is around 150 euros), or in case of a higher bonus, it can be extended to liability insurance.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it provides protection to the owner in the event of damage events, but also because it is a large expense, so it is essential to choose the personalized form of insurance appropriately.
Celtic wants to score a point in Milan to make it to the 8th round.
Milan and Celtic will compete at the San Siro Stadium on Tuesday to score the missing point at the end of the Champions League. The Italians will be the first, and the Scots will be able to qualify.
The Italians have a total of 10 points, and in the fifth round they secured a tie with Portugal, but Celtic has nine points, but one more point is needed to ensure that the six-pointer Shakhtar, who will fight the four-pointer Benfica, does not overtake him.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan is due to play in the Club World Cup in Japan, where he will try to advance to the 16th final on the 13th in the semi-final.
With this, Group D will close sooner than the others, and although the most likely result at Giuseppe Meazza will be a tie, the two teams will strive to win, as the Italians do not want to be left behind at home, and Celtic will be the first to start from a better place in the 8th round.
Even losing to Gordon Strachan is enough to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but you can't be sure, because if there is a point equivalence, the Ukrainians will advance, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to make it bitter for the Scots, who want to make it to the eighth final of the reorganized Champions League twice in a row, after they just scored a goal from Kaka in the extension after a 0-0 draw (1-0).
The "Rossonerik" win would be most delighted by Shakhtar, because if Celtic loses, it will be in the eighth round and stay in UEFA.
Because Benfica, despite being in the last place at the moment and having no chance of remaining in the European Championship, can still take third place with a win to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, with 20,000 spectators for the first time since they split up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) at GM Place, Vancouver, just a few minutes before the concert was announced that the band will be in the form of "rem".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which featured a film about the band's history in the 1990s.
With the reunion of the band and the tour, EMI also released a new album in Spain, featuring major hits and two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls performed in a bracelet given to them by their husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was also in the crowded GM Place auditorium, although she had been banned by Victoria a few days earlier.
At the start of the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star “hasn’t seen our dress yet, so I’m nervous about what she’ll think of the show.”
'Sporty Spice', was the reason why the band broke up two years after leaving the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other". He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings for the Spice Girls had changed.
I thought, why not? Now I’m glad I made that decision,” said Chisholm about the band, which broke up nine years earlier because of him.
The singer added that over time, “things have been arranged and we love each other very much.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV television, the band arrived in Vancouver on a separate plane from Virgin Airlines.
A group of baby-sitters were waiting for them at the airport.
Five of them have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California, USA, then in San Jose (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
They will be performing in Madrid on December 23.
Other fears about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
There has been a renewed gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia, which could also affect Russian fuel to be shipped to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is flown through Ukraine and disputes between the two nations are always attentive.
Kiev has said that if Moscow raises the price of gas to be paid by the Ukrainians, they will also impose higher transit costs on Russia.
As a result of a previous dispute between the two countries last year, supplies to EU countries have decreased.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow concerns an attempt by the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom to agree on the price of gas to be paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom said it would have to increase its gas production from neighbouring Turkmenistan by 50% compared to the price agreement concluded with Ukraine in 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of a shipment from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is important that during the negotiations we argue in line with one of the most important transit countries for natural gas," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinah told Reuters.
“The changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to our debate on the cost of transits through Ukraine (and to Western Europe).
As a result of the recent major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom shut down the gas tap leading to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like decline in exports to Western Europe, which also pushed up prices to a large extent.
A quarter of the European Union’s gas supply comes from Russian gas.
Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom will supplement its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
NHS 'must check foreign workers'
Scottish NHS committees need to improve the monitoring of criminal records of workers coming from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal was presented by Robert Black, the chief accountant, after a doctor with a foreign nationality in Scotland was linked to the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on its overseas workforce.
However, in its report, through a sample of five health authorities, it also pointed out key controls that were properly carried out.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the chief accountant checked the list of employees recruited outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullaho, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep hit the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of three doctors interviewed by the Old Bailey Court in October on charges of attempted car bombings in the UK.
The NHS committees must verify the qualifications and work experience of their employees from overseas before starting employment, as well as their availability of the necessary permits to work in the United Kingdom.
Although Scottish health committees use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the UK.
Among other things, the Chief Auditor’s report suggested that committees should introduce a Criminal Records Office guide that would facilitate the employer’s control processes with the various overseas countries.
"While we found evidence of such checks in the personnel records, they are not being carried out regularly," the report said.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS is fulfilling its own pre-employment screening process at a high level, he added: “Our report highlights areas of the system that can be improved in order to keep up-to-date on the number of NHS overseas personnel.”
Dr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely improbable” that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report says the current pre-employment checks are working well in NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent,” he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of overseas employees, consisting of a majority of doctors and nurses, is 1,161.
However, the chief accountant pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, partly due to the fact that committees have problems identifying employees on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures put in place by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely harmonised.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and evidence of qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the directive and guidance on pre-employment checks for NHS staff from overseas.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I am delighted that this task has been carried out following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He also added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with health committees, will take into account the suggestions contained in the report and will ensure that the up-to-date guidance on pre-employment inspections for all staff, including those from overseas, reflects best practice. The updated version is planned to be published next month.
Joy Division at the film awards
The biopic "Control" from Joy Division's late singer, Ian Curtis, swept through five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Picture Award.
The main character was Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis was cast, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench won the Best Actress award for her thriller “Details of a Scandal.”
The Variety Prize was awarded to Daniel Craig, who played Bond, for putting the British film in the spotlight.
The prizes were awarded during a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
The film "Control" portrays the rise of Curtis within Joy Division until 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The film, featuring "The Killers", "David Bowie" and "New Order on the Soundtrack", cost only <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Dutch photographer Corbijn, who had previously been known for making the cover of U2's "Joshua Tree", nevertheless earned two awards: Best Director and Best Beginner Director.
Another winner of the ceremony focused on rock music; Julien Temple’s film about Joe Strummer, the singer of Clash, took the award for best documentary.
Best Actor: Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of David Cronenberg's London-based thriller "Murder Promises" mafia boss.

Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells had been arrested and planned to carry out an impending attack on an oil facility, as well as a series of strikes against religious figures and security forces.
According to state television, one of the largest oil exporters in the world, one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles through.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to a television report, an eight-person cell led by a foreign resident planned to launch an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province.
After an Al-Qaeda-organized attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006, Saudi Arabia began building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect the facilities.
According to the report, 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a “specialist in missile launches” who crosses the border illegally.
The report also reported that the fighters were trying to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom's territory.
Twenty-two of the detainees were planning to carry out attacks against church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on church leaders to take tougher action to curb the influx of Al Qaeda militants into Iraq who are fighting against allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shia Muslim government, which the Saudi hardline Sunnis regard as heretics.
Al-Qaeda fighters see a significant number of Saudi ecclesiastical leaders as being involved by the authorities in support of the policies of the ruling royal family.
Encouraged by a call by Al-Qaeda’s Saudi-born leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government, the group’s fighters targeted foreign-resident settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
"The security forces have made a huge effort over the past five months," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-strong "media cell" was also captured, the aim of which was to spread "takfiri thinking". Takfiri thinking is an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports violent action against Muslims stigmatized as unfaithful and apostate.
Among the detainees were 32 people accused of financially supporting the militants.
The climate of Venus could provide a prospect for the future of the Earth
Scientists found that Venus once provided pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggest that this planet is much more likely to be considered the Earth’s whimsical twin brother than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two planets are almost the same in size and have similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists now know that, billions of years ago, Venus may have had very similar living conditions to Earth and even habitable conditions.
However, due to the extraordinarily high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation, and the planet's lower rotational velocity, Venus has entered a completely different evolutionary trajectory.
Today, the planet's water has evaporated, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is being destroyed by hurricane-powered winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe, based on a year-long study of the planet, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes could occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, a professor of physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “Start figuring out why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, despite the fact that the two planets are very similar in structure.
“Our new data has enabled us to develop a scenario for the formation of Venus billions of years ago, when it could still have habitable conditions similar to those of Earth.
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
One kilogram of radioactive material -- enriched uranium, according to reports -- was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesman, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said the material could have been sold for <0x24>1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Wide open doors
Mitt Romney says he is not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
However, Republican candidates in the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions posed on Wednesday evening, November 28, turned out to be as ridiculous as those of the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in a debate the other party broadcasted on YouTube.
However, the questions and answers this time well reflected the situation of the Republican party approaching next year’s election.
It is not yet known exactly how CNN’s production managers, who co-financed the debate, selected the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates.
The longest issue in the first half-hour of the debate concerned immigration.
This is a Republican theme.
CNN has asked some insecure voters to dial a number if they find it tempting: the mediator has experienced a high degree of consensus when the candidates have spoken out harshly about the issue of borders.
The most vivid and longest debate was between Rudy Giuliani, who was the national leader, and Romney, who was advancing in the crucial pre-elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change her image of being too light-handed in dealing with illegal immigration during her time as mayor of New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house.
The quarrel between the two became particularly heated when the questioners asked for support for "amnesty" (which would give illegal immigrants permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as Duncan Hunter from California and Tom Tancredo from Colorado, have managed to delve deeply into the subject.
And although none of them are likely to win the nomination, their stay on the track may be explained by the fact that they started ringing the immigration bell earlier and louder than the others.
At least in the area of immigration, there is a broad consensus among the candidates: the common goal is to strengthen borders and to take tough action against illegal immigrants.
This topic, like the fear of toxic toys in China and other disturbing factors coming from the outside world, will help within Republicans to obscure or minimize the division between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when other issues came to the fore, the debate became very unpleasant.
Giuliani was confronted with the question of why he had previously supported gun control.
John McCain and Romney debated whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
Another questioner asked if the candidates believed all the words of the Bible.
In this regard, Giuliani stumbled upon the viewpoint that, although he considered the Bible to be his favorite book, he might not have interpreted the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who had just won the first place in the Iowa election, and who owed his victory to his steadfast Christian conservatism, said that the death penalty was painful, but needed.
When asked whether Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than to run for election.
The competition is unusually open.
Huckabee’s dynamic uprising in Iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul’s fundraising campaign and the enthusiastic cheering around him at Wednesday’s debate.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wing of the party have so far failed to launch a joint candidate from among the more familiar and traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who chanted in time and persuasively the message of victory proclaiming the greatness of America, and who found a common voice with both wing of the party.
But now the party is divided, and the consequences are still unpredictable.
Workers' Pain
Another chasm in front of Gordon Brown; the way out remains unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, the current one doesn’t seem too spicy.
No one has sold his honor, no politician has found his hotel bills in Paris, and no one has committed an out-of-marriage scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman, under the names of others, for more than four years had made a covert contribution of more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 (<0x24>1.3 million) to the ruling Labour Party of Great Britain, and that the party had not reported on this, is one of the things that Gordon Brown would have done well without.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister escaped the election, and when his statement – that the polls had not influenced the outcome of the decision – recklessly questioned the intellectual capacity of the British people, people still hoped that Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
But instead, as Vince Cable, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, remarked with increasingly witty remarks, changed from the once feared Brown Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Failure to save Northern Rock has put regulatory weaknesses and judgement in the crossfire.
The sickening proposals to change the tax law have encouraged business interest groups to join forces against the government.
The loss of 25 million people’s personal data by the tax authority revealed an unimaginable degree of administrative clumsiness.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals instigated a riot, protesting the reduction of the army's budget, declaring that the position of the Minister of Defense was part-time.
And now here are the mysterious donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of the Labour Party (formerly head of administration) has already resigned.
These accidents do not mean that Brown cannot turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point where control becomes impossible.
People do not like or trust politicians, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
But as soon as it becomes clear that the prime minister is unlikely to be able to move things forward, and may not stay in office for long, the suspended infidelity will end: the staff of civil servants will start leaking, Cabinet ministers will go to briefings, the press will look for bad-mouthed news; and the government will begin to defensive and unable to concentrate.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult position because, unlike other political leaders, he is not considered “fresh blood.”
As much as he wanted to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was still his right-hand man.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax records, for example, are linked to decisions made during Brown's time as finance minister.
And while he was not directly involved in Blair’s misdeeds, such as the protracted investigation into the relationship between the “noble for money” affair and political party funding, voters can rightly assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is indeed unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
The blunders committed are not as frightening as they appear to be in the market.
As in Mr. Bean's case, no one was killed, no one was directly tricked into it.
Compensation, however painful it may be, can be the creation of the tendencies that Stalin in Brown has always promised: reliable, firm and somewhat hard-handed government.
A good example is political donation.
The garbiously mysterious Abrahams, who likens his gift to charity, stated that he did not want to disclose his benevolence to the public.
Perhaps that is the case, but the decision was not his responsibility.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of major political supporters is clear and clearly justified: the public has the right to know who is knocking at the gates of the rulers of the country.
Watt, who said he was aware of Abrahams' actions but was unaware of their illegal nature, will certainly be sweated during the interrogations; as will Jon Medleson, the Labour Party's chief of foundations, who learned of the turbulent donations in October.
To Brown, however, for the time being, there are no leads: there is no indication that he knew about these coils, not even that the huge sums were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half of his job.
Although he had condemned the violation of the law by his party, his firmness was diluted by using a familiar tool; he commissioned a commission led by a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the case, just in case.
In this story, the "learning lesson" is not too complicated.
In case of violation of the law, the police are responsible.
In addition, Mr Brown has to put other things in order, such as the appointment of the chairman of the independent committee on administrative rules, which has been running for six months without a leader, or the advancement of effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard-hatted Labour Party to cooperate with the Tori and to break with the special financial ties associated with the associations - this would be a hard wall for the party-loyal Brown.
But you should face some facts about the party.
According to surveys, the Conservatives currently have a major advantage; Brown has two years to win back voters behind him; the only way to achieve victory is through impeccable integrity and strong competency.
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis threatening the American credit card market?
If there is blood in the water, it is natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weakening, predators are focusing on the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail credit, the credit card market could lose up to <0x24>99 billion.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the depreciation rate reflecting the rate of unrecoverable loans and the default rate reflecting the rate of late payments after 30 days have increased.
HSBC reported a <0x24>1.4 billion loss in the U.S. consumer finance segment last month, partly due to cardholders’ financial weaknesses.
However, panic is premature.
The rate of write-offs and late payments remains low.
The late payment rate of 3.89% calculated by Moody's for the third quarter is one full percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decrease in rates is partly due to technical factors.
The amendment of the US rules on individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency filings, while at the same time it caused large losses in the credit card market; a re-increase in the number of bankruptcy applications (and thus the write-off rate) is expected, regardless of whether the overall conditions for borrowing are deteriorating or not.
The payment rate, which shows the rate of monthly credit repayment by consumers, is also stable in the market.
In addition, confidence in credit card-backed securities is also rather strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup estimates that emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers are increasing the debt on credit cards to repay home loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor the flow of money rather than the value of assets, so a fall in housing prices does not necessarily cause a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The situation may even benefit the creditors.
If the property is worth less than the mortgage value, the incentive for consumers to repay the loan is reduced; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards advances in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or lending limits, card issuers can adapt faster and more flexibly to changing conditions than mortgage lenders.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden repricing of assets.
“It’s unlikely we’ll wake up one day to completely revalue loans,” says Gary Perlin, CFO of Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual recession is much more present.
If declining housing prices and falling lending plunge America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a bleak future.
It's worth watching those predatory fins.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron case
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who had been brought to trial to investigate their involvement in fraud involving Enron's former CFO Andrew Faston's name were pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded innocent of seven-order fraud allegations that they had allegedly cooperated with Fastow in a covert scam in 2000 to get rich at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
But at a court hearing in front of the U.S. District Judge, Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to one-off fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group’s Greenwich NatWest division became known in Britain during the two-year extradition procedure.
The investigation into Enron’s collapse in 2001 in the United States is still awaiting completion.
The first indictment against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
The three brokers called the "NatWest Triple" were charged with traveling to Houston in 2000 in order to prepare for the scam, along with Fastow and Michael Kopper, who was Fastow's right-hand man at the time.
Fastow, responsible for planning the countless frauds that bankrupted Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank was unaware of any shareholding in the subsidiary, but the three British men were well aware that the shareholding was very large.
A company controlled by Kopper acquired the bank’s <0x24>1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper <0x24>250,000 to acquire a stake in the company.
Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company was buying a <0x24>20 million stake in its subsidiary from Greenwich NatWest.
But in reality, the <0x24>20 million hit the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received <0x24>7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received <0x24>12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to the collapse of Enron.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving three years and a month in a Texas prison.
The three British men could travel to the United States on bail of <0x24>1 million each, where they would stay during the trial.
Enron, the seventh-largest U.S. company ever, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks that could no longer cover the millions accumulated as debts and the companies that appear to be profitable but are in fact loss-making.
Thousands of jobs were lost due to the collapse, with market values dropping by more than <0x24>60 billion and pension funds dropping by more than <0x24>2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder and former CEO of Enron, Jeffrey Skilling, was convicted last year of complicity in the company’s bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud, and other charges against Lay ended with his death last year.
No Poverty in Moscow
A Gulfstream G550 aircraft with a Rolls-Royce engine will start at <0x24>54 million and will carry a single tank between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption.
But for some rich Russians, this amount is only a small amount of money.
"It can accommodate 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
“But no one orders so many seats because the machines are bought for private families or corporate executives.”
Mr. Firer was counting on visitors to the four-day exclusive Millionaire Fair, held in the huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods suppliers rented booths at the exhibition, hoping that Russian newcomers would be interested in everything from mahogany-covered yachts to diamond-plated 50-cent radiator grilles.
Mr. Firer watched carefully the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it doesn't touch our products," he said.
“After the United States, Russia has the largest market for private jets.”
The Russian capital seems to be swimming in money just like Dallas did in his prime, during the oil price explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe, and these Americans were considered materialistic here," said Marshall Goldman, a senior fellow at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the gamblers in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and Japan in the 1990s, the Russians have now become the world’s most spectacular gamblers.
The most exclusive luxury brands claim their share of the gold rush.
At another conference organized by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products in markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes’ list of richest people, there are 53 billion people living in Russia, with a total of <0x24>282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103,000, totaling <0x24>670 billion, according to a study by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, which analyzes personal welfare development in the former Soviet Union.
(According to the World Bank, the number of people living below the livelihoods in Russia was 15.8 percent in 2005.)
“Hundreds of millionaires live in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative at the David Morris jewelry store in London.
Nicole attended the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are all well-groomed, and men are a treasure trove.”
The two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, who roamed the halls in evening dress on Sunday night, attributed themselves and their clients to being millionaires.
"I've been looking at the cars and trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who rudely hurried and twisted in his custom-designed dress, as if he had become accustomed to this commotion.
The fair was organized primarily for newcomers, those brand-oriented Russian buyers who are willing to walk around a zirconia-decorated venue after several hours in traffic, where they can find at the same time Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick apartment ice cream, ordinary billiard tables, dubbing.
For the average person, the entrance ticket costs 30 euros (<0x24>44.57).
"The Russians love to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who took a patriotic seat at the stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft, as opposed to a wall-sized hand-decorated Rembrandt painted on a blue tile.
“The Russians are more interested in the obvious.”
Indeed, the sellers here said that the wealthy Russians for a long time (according to Russian standards this means 10-15 years) have already shifted from blatant logos to bagatell, limited edition brands that would not be allowed to enter a trade fair.
Yet thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires' agents and tourists, filled the place every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of King Koil bed manufacturing company, said that he sold two gold-woven mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, each worth <0x24>70,000.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales associate at A1 Moto, which supplies high-quality cars with a modern alarm, reported that his company sold the glossy orange Porsche for <0x24> 170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Andrei Karapetian, president of luxury car manufacturer L.A. Connection, has sold three radiator grilles for the Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon. The grilles resemble interconnected chain bracelets and cost <0x24>55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which he said was covered with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The price of a four-piece set is <0x24>22,000.
"A Russian millionaire who wants ostrich-leather wheels and a picture of his wife's face made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily use these items," Karapetian said.
"He'll keep them in his garage with 30-40 cars in his place."
Despite the fact that many of his Russian clients are rich, Karapetian says that the term "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege these days, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
"Anyone who bought a property in Moscow four or five years ago is now a millionaire, if not in money, at least on paper," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least have created the appearance of wealth in front of the stand of the Russian asset management company Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style phone booths, which were piled up with millions of counterfeit dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the Millionaires’ Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money. Many of them had their cell phones take pictures of themselves as they lay in the money heaps, or just pocketed a few million.
"You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," Karryev said.
Surgical malpractice suspected behind death in New Jersey
The day before Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked out the window of a restaurant called “Just a little healthier” and saw an ambulance stop two doors down West Scott Avenue on Cape Cod.
Soon after, a police car arrived.
Then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop," said Mr. Livingston, one of the inspectors at the restaurant.
"I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman is 41 years old, her name is Olga Arroyo, who had previously worked as a senior assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
An investigation is underway to determine whether the death was caused by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon on West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have not yet been able to determine what caused Arroya’s death, but they hope that the results of the toxicology tests, which will be available in a few weeks’ time, will reveal this mysterious death that has affected senior police officers in Newark with great pain.
Arroyo, whose voice was widely known in the department, has been working as an assistant to police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"He was loyal, hardworking and reliable," McCarthy said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
". He was my watchman.
He was my protector.”
McCarthy said she was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who currently works for the Distillery Control Committee, and had left behind two boys, a 14-year-old and an 11-year-old, as well as a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators were working to determine whether Ms. Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgeon’s intervention.
"There is a probability," Walsh said.
"The investigation is currently underway."
Reports from the authorities indicate that they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m. in November.
On the 21st, Mrs. Arroyo was found on the couch.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed, and so far the police have said very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh hasn't said anything about whether Castro's been heard by the detectives.
Participants in the study were asked to see if a part of the house functioned as a doctor’s office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of Castro’s home, where a faded rose bush stood in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door to the cellar, in the car entrance, there was a blue tank with the inscription "Etil Vanilin", which is used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume.
Two mountain bikes were hung sideways from hooks.
McCarthy recalled that when she arrived in Newark for the first time in 25 years, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help in helping her navigate the unusual and rough political culture of the new city.
“He always said, ‘You’ll be better off with this and that!’” he recalled.
"He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always inside when I left in the evening.
It was embarrassing.”
Expectations of Fed interest rate cuts lead to global stock market crash
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday, after reassuring statements by the deputy Governor of the Central Bank of the United States increased his hopes that the Fed would seek to ease investment opportunities by further cutting interest rates.
Stock markets in London, New York, and across Europe have stagnated after Donald Kohn, who is considered the right-hand man of Fed President Ben Bernanke, said leaders should respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing unrest in financial markets.
In addition to Kohn’s clear intention to calm the markets in the midst of the signs of a resurgent credit crisis, he said the current unrest had “partially set back the progress made in the markets at the end of September and in October.”
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on the credit conditions of households and companies.
Investors have interpreted the statements as saying that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into the U.S. markets or even further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The statements have also calmed Wall Street, which has recently been hit by a number of bad news about the U.S. economy, including a negative record of U.S. home sales.
The financial turmoil was amplified by the announcement by the investment bank Bear Stearns that it would lay off 650 workers and 4% of its global workforce as part of a cost reduction to offset losses in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector.
A total of 20 jobs in London’s 1,500-employee headquarters will be affected by the above measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average index increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed at 13,289.40 points, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65%.
The FTSE 100 index in London increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of British blue-chip companies.
The German Dax grew by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 by 2.3 percent.
The turmoil in the credit market resurfaced after a high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank delivered three-month papers to European banks at a price of 4.7 percent since April 2001.
As the English interbank rate Libor reached its highest level since September, 6.59 percent, after a steady increase since November 12, the Bank of England was under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to provide additional capital for the London financial market.
Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara demand a decision in England
There are two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who gets the English team's six in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the indirect context of the first test against Sri Lanka, it is no less important who will make the decision?
The latter question is topical, on the one hand, because David Graveney, the president of the selection board, who is temporarily fulfilling this particular task, is helping lead coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan make the decision. On the other hand, because the desk drawer of the English executive director Hugh Morris is beginning to be filled with requests for a national or at least one-time selection position.
The shortest of the two players is the one who does not get the sixth place, but as is known, life, and especially sport, is often unfair.
It’s never easy to say what makes you reach the peak of your vocation, while others can’t get past even a lower level. Often it depends on luck rather than talent.
It is not only cricket that is difficult to select, often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair for Shah if that happens?
The same question may arise in other areas of life, for example, if, for example, John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, well-educated young leaders with a good knowledge of business, were to be put before decision-makers, while there is only room for one of the two.
Who can tell which level a cricket player is suitable for without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, data has a big impact on decision making, but the options are just as important.
In a team, the player must catch the captain’s eye at the right moment in the cricket gate, and a batsman must regularly get a chance to become a big player.
Catching the eye of the pickers is much more complicated.
James Anderson, for example, has played better last season, but he is a solid team member on the first test, even though Stephen Harmison says he’s in good shape and he’s doing very well.
Anderson won the tour with 32 first-class knockouts and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett has only scored 29, but both of them have had successes at the highest level and hope to continue to do so in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium will be decided on the basis of the opinions.
This decision may blow up or break anyone’s career, but it may not have a particular impact on the future.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty performed well on all tests and with five goals and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood who emerged at the time and became a prominent test cricketer, who may still be underestimated even today, even though he scored a double hundred points against the Australians in Australia.
It is probable that at their meeting at Asgiriya Stanion during today’s game, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative intuitions and will vote for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful vitality and dynamism.
There are arguments for both.
Shah's bright and successful debut in the Bombay test quarters of the 88th Test, against Bopara's six-year-old 22-year-old, who also scored excellent twist throws, he reached 32 first-class 100s.
However, the fact that Middlesex player Shah ran only ten in two quarters against the West Indies at home in May at the Lorda test, and the fact that Vaughan, who was fighting for his replay in the next game, faced immediate opposition from the cast, seems to have reduced his endurance, which was clearly visible in Bombay.
In contrast, Essex’s universal talent is a lively and unsurpassed player.
There is nothing to upset him on the cricket track, but his off-track behavior was well described when he rolled over at an exhibition with a four-wheeler from the team’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
However, the first thing he did after that was to take Vodafone's (of course sponsored) phone and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who was watching him from a distance, and ask him, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a better edge player with classics. With its sliding mid-steps, it creates a win-win throwing angle, and its punches are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and another is the right moment.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection.
Personally, I would give Bopara the chance now, which doesn’t mean I don’t think Shah would be outstanding if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he was the one playing over the weekend.
Refugees are being transported home by bus to work and fight Al Qaeda
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria to Baghdad have arrived with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money, their visas have expired, or who hope the city will be back in order.
Some of them have returned to fight the soldiers who drove them out of their homes.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus, filling dozens of buses, arrived.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sunni doctor Sabah al-Qubaisi.
“I came back today because I saw on TV and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to militant pastor Moqtada al-Sadr, who is currently shutting down his Shiite army.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from Amariyah, a predominantly Sunni country, returned home with his two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented the Iraqis from taking a job.
The Shiite neighbors of Amarija called him and urged him to return home, saying they had managed to displace Al Qaeda from their bastion in the western part of the capital with the help of U.S.-backed troops.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader fleeing a grenade attack from his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, after he began urging his fellow citizens to fight Al Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, my friends called me and told me that they had created an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and they needed the support of me and my sons.
That’s why I came back today,” said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the peace that had been strengthened in the capital since the American troops had invaded, and of the fact that they had been lured home by armed civilian forces cooperating with the Americans.
However, more people were forced to return from Damascus due to visa and financial problems.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old with three children, voiced a widespread view among refugees that Shia Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had asked the Syrian government to reject the refugees’ visa application in order to force them to return home.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people have fled from the death squads operating in the country.
“Everything was fine until al-Maliki made a visit to Syria and pressured the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis in order to move them home,” he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I ran away.”
One of the reasons for the alleviation of violence is the expulsion of the Sunni from the skies, while the skies have also left the Sunni-inhabited areas, which has led to a reduction in tensions in many areas.
Many fear that the sudden arrival of refugees will once again upset the mood, which may lead to more fighting.
Small Saarland - high quality training
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training, and its higher education has an international orientation.
Only in one area of training do the islanders have the same shortcomings as the rest of the country.
“Yesterday, for the 50th time, I explained to a person outside the Saarland that we are not French,” a self-ironical slogan said on his posters to commemorate the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system in the Saarland, which, according to surveys by the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne, can boast the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries, not least because of their traditions.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the share of foreign students is high at 15.6%.
However, the attractiveness of the universities and colleges in the Saarland is also above average for those who want to study in the Saarland – many of them do not even have a high school qualification.
"In the Saarland, the opportunities for professional training are being exploited," explains Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the German Institute of Economics.
More than one-fifth of young people are eligible for further education in vocational schools, making the Saarland more than seven percent above the federal average.
The combination of professional and tertiary education is well-developed.
The dual study infrastructure ranks second in terms of population in Germany.
However, despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has declined by a third in recent years.
The Saarland Ministry of Education therefore required higher education institutions to undertake a marketing campaign focusing on engineering sciences.
"We initiated a number of reforms in primary schools after the first Pisa study," a spokesman for the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests across the country.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. This is a model that has since begun to be copied by other federal states.
Whether students’ performance will improve permanently will only be answered by future comparative studies.
According to the 2003 Pisa survey, the percentage of pupils at risk has shrunk from 29 to 20 percent.
However, overall performance in the Saarland did not improve as much as in the other Länder.
The Bavarians are better at counting.
To the greatest annoyance of the islanders, knowledge of foreign languages is not taken into account in the Pisa survey - otherwise, they would be rewarded in this area,
because the language of the neighbouring countries is a mandatory subject in high schools - even if the islanders are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is changing the clock
In the near future, classes will be different in Venezuela than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez will return qualifying in Latin America by half an hour.
Meanwhile, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez became a laughing stock in Spain.
According to Venezuela’s official newspaper, a new law will reverse clocks by four and a half hours compared to Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is against the United States, said that the entire clock-based time zones had been forced into the world by the United States.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez also announced on Wednesday (local time) the disconnection from neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage situation.
As long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he has no contact with the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I cannot do this because of my own dignity,” Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez said, calling for a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to give their opinion in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, it would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for the dispute was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with the Colombian Marxist rebels.
Uribe’s decision was to “spoil” Venezuela, Chavez said on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
A new mobile ringtone in the country has caught the eye: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth) - this is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
The sentence comes from King John Charles of Spain, who at the last Latin American summit was so upset by the constant shouts of the Baloldan populist politician that he uttered it in this way.
Wage drop threatens Germans in 2007
According to a forecast, real wages are threatening German workers this year, despite strong economic conditions.
Experts have substantiated their pessimistic predictions.
According to the calculations of the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, in 2007 employees could actually expect lower salaries than in the previous year.
"The reason for this is the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the rapid rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomic and Economic Research told Bild.
There may also be additional burdens on employees when it comes to unemployment insurance.
Treasury Secretary Peer Steinbrück said in a statement to the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that in the current situation it is right and reasonable to reduce unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the start of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult position to apply for credit or support, a politician from the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD, was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
In year-on-year comparison, prices increased by a total of 3 percent.
Venus is the devil twin of the Earth.
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to Earth than previously assumed: in its atmosphere, the European space probe Venus Express has discovered lightning and in its poles wind turbulences such as those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have been assuming lightning on Venus.
The European space probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it has discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus is spreading from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, reports Christpher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles, California, in the columns of the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "primordial soup theory, the formation of life on Earth was triggered by lightning: According to the theory, thunderstorms triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If life ever existed there, it must have been in very early times,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
At present, there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the hellish twin brother of Earth, but it's still his twin brother," Russell said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, in its mass and size so similar to Earth, is on a completely different evolutionary path.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus research, because since the early 1990s, no probe has been on the way specifically to find this planet.
The latest findings, already presented in several "Nature" papers, do not just prove the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"They also indicate that the similarity of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than we initially assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known Arctic hurricane, the researchers also discovered an even faster-moving cloud vortex in the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents of the Earth's winter hemispheric, according to a team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the solar system has a mass almost equal to that of Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, it is almost the size of Earth.
The star, also known as the Evening Star, orbits the Sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much slower around its own axis: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus’s surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius, coupled with a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles that of Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under identical conditions.
Both of them had accumulated water, which remained on Earth as an ocean, until Venus went into the universe.
And while on Earth, carbon dioxide is bound in the carbonate rocks, on Venus, it forms a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
German President Köhler has called for the end of the dispute between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
German President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s authority and called on the Grand Coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not be seen as a divided nation towards the outside world on this issue," Köhler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
"Human rights are universal to me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
“Everyone knows that Germany has to look after the foreign policy delicate balance,” the president said; however, he defended Merkel against accusations that the chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not broken with the traditional ‘one China’ policy.
China is also aware of this," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed displeasure with the reception of the Dalai Lama and therefore became a target of attacks in the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU’s “window policy” in the field of foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were severe disturbances in the German-Chinese relations.
As a result, the Chinese leadership not only withdrew the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL, it also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries’ foreign ministries.
Chinese President Wen Jiabao has called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that it was a mistake to receive the Dalai Lama.
China refuses to allow European politicians to accept the Tibetan religious leader in their official capacity, Wen Jiabao said.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have shown that he is trying to separate further Tibetan territories from China, including Tibet and other modern-day provinces.
Schäuble warns of riots similar to those in France
Street clashes with the police, shots fired, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots similar to those in France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not lead to street violence, demanded the Federal Interior Minister.
Barricades were on fire, gunners fired shotguns at police officers: After severe riots among young people in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
“We need to make sure that social explosives do not accumulate here and do not end up in violence.
We need to take this seriously,” he told the Hannover newspaper "Neue Presse".
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Alliances, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to solve problematic cases, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the Summit on Integration to the Islamic Conference, the first successes are already visible.”
However, it is still too early to resolve the emergency.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that in the German suburbs there are no such urban and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people have been fighting heavy street battles with the police in recent nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings were on fire.
With this in mind, Kenan Kolat, the head of the Turkish Communities in Germany, demanded more activity from the federal government in terms of integration.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "hazards of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
But action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families is “higher than average”.
First and foremost, more educational facilities should be provided.
Kolat emphasized: "We need to provide a perspective for young people."
However, the head of the Turkish community added that "social supervision within the family" is much more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns, “We must be vigilant.”
Young people "must be given the opportunity to work and receive education as soon as possible".
Meanwhile, in Villiers-le-Bel, a suburb of Paris, there was complete tranquility during the night.
Hundreds of policemen were ready to deploy, a helicopter was scanning the area with a headlight.
The authorities reported three arrests, as well as some burning garbage dumps and cars.
Since reporting, a safety unit of around 1,000 people has been providing peace of mind.
Police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
During the night of Tuesday, about 80 police officers were wounded as a result of the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots erupted in connection with a traffic accident in which two young people died on Sunday.
According to the state prosecutor’s office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
the Cloud Runner Angela 's
The chancellor’s unrealistic actions are proof that the coalition is coming to an end – and nothing can be expected of him.
In which country does the Federal Chancellor live?
After his bleak, indifferent and meaningless action in the general debate of the Bundestag, it must be established that he does not live here - he does not live in the country which he would be responsible for governing.
Angela Merkel has rejected the allegations with a very superior sentence, saying that she would be too focused on foreign policy.
This is provincial, he replied, and in this way only expressed that he did not want to understand what those who criticized him were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how pertinent the reproaches are.
At the same time, there was no specific interest or empathy for the country’s problems.
Instead, Cloudbuster Angela emerged: a politician who is disillusioned with reality and flees to foreign policy, where uncertainty is hers.
Example of climate protection: The Heiligendamm Resolutions praises itself unbridledly, but is silent on how the climate change goals should be achieved in the country.
At all, as far as self-compassion is concerned, such modesty would not have been tolerated by the CDU president two years earlier.
Now he is clinging to the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This is detrimental to his reputation as a pragmatic personality who offers solutions to problems instead of words.
But in Angela’s skyscraper realm, domestic political problems are only side issues.
Child Poverty and Low Income Problems?
This is only worth a few half sentences.
It is quite telling in this regard how often it makes language mistakes when it comes to family allowances.
Merkel will have to step forward three times to come up with a half-legged sentence.
When it comes to specifics, he's wandering in foreign territory.
Squad Division
During the debate between Republican presidential candidates on YouTube, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, had a hard-hitting exchange – and now they have to fear an outside candidate.
The tensions between the candidates have already surfaced in connection with the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, of making New York a “safe haven for illegal immigrants.”
“I would say that his own house was a refuge for illegal immigrants,” Giuliani retorts to the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants as a private person.
As the Republican camp still lacks a unanimously backed favourite, the eight presidential nominees are using the debate on CNN to undermine their opponent’s credibility.
The 30-second videos uploaded by internet users via YouTube are little more than short summaries.
“We have brought Hitler to power with this kind of isolationism,” John McCain rubs under the nose of his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one in the circle to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney’s head is also thoroughly washed by a Vietnam veteran who is reluctant to condemn the so-called “Waterboarding” as torture, a method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated.
The fact that the important topics of the campaign are still beyond Iraq and the debates on torture is evidenced by the reactions of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida.
A loud applause breaks out in the room for praising conservative values and rejecting future tax increases.
In the meantime, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more apparent.
"I was wrong then," Romney said, apologizing to supporters and television viewers for his decision to abort in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is shaken when asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf to govern as a civilian for the first time
A day after his resignation from the army, Musharraf was sworn in as the ruling Pakistani president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for a further five years on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the capital, the Presidential Palace in Islamabad.
Musharraf swore an oath to the Constitution and to act for the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus yielded to international pressure, above all from the United States.
Eight years after the general's attempt at power without bloodshed in the form of a military coup, he is now ruling for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With Musharraf’s resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he met a basic demand from the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on November 3.
Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum said Musharraf would end the state of emergency shortly after he was sworn in, fulfilling a further demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, where Musharraf placed lawyers sympathizing with him after the declaration of the state of emergency in early November, last week rejected any objections to the president’s controversial re-election on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in northern Waziristan.
According to a military spokesman, the bomb was detonated on a road near the Afghan border.
The Krautrock Fathers are Back
The German supergroup from the 1970s is playing again: three members of the Harmonia band have dusted their instruments again for a concert in Berlin.
During the reunion, a cut from their era, the time of "Live 1974", appears.
At that time, they were much better known abroad.
The reported sensation is manifested in the three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
In front of each is his own instrument, his own cable and, above all, his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits on the throne with his 63-year-old in a snow-white shirt.
From the left, Michael Rother, who is 57 years old, provides escorts with a laptop and guitar.
From the right, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius bends and focuses on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, at the same time a rhythm once in a while.
Sometimes it just happens to be traditional music.
However, this does not seem to be particularly disturbing to the gentlemen themselves.
It was a great thrill for the fans of the Krautrock music to see Harmonia again.
What we can already tell you: As a result of a proper follow-up, we can conclude that the name has swept through the collective pop memory, but in no way left any lasting clues that this band is painfully missing after 32 years.
Why can't the Germans celebrate the living legends of their 70s?
Especially since what is misleadingly called krautrock has always been valued more in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award for his oeuvre to the still-living members of the Cologne-based band Can in 2003, the German pop figures were sitting in the hall with an incomprehensible face.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the surprise became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother was an old buddy of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is overwhelmed by Harmonia only because the trio only existed for two years, and during this time it had a far less impact than others attributed to it afterwards.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed together with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the cellar underneath the Schaubühne Theater in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, a church-funded record company.
Rother helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and at the same time he gained fame as the guitarist of the then perhaps most radical German band, Neu!.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians to their exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th-century Rom as a communier who fled the city.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius worked as a babysitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllic artist.
It is said that the Harmonia Ottenstein's flag came out of the garbage and thus found a name for their art.
Some of these things were recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next is "De Luxe".
Despite their soft and modest music, the band was in financial need.
Picking up currants alone did not ensure finding oneself.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded at a concert in Griessen, in front of a record-breaking audience of just 50 people, so anyone remembers.
The exertion and occasional practice of Harmonia was Rother's idea at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral claim.
The band announced their dissolution in 1975.
Rother ended up in esoterics and maintained himself from albums such as Flammende Herzen.
Cluster was revived in the 1980s, which has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The Griessem live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company called Greenland has set itself the goal of caring for Krautrock as a specific German addition to live music.
In this context, Neu! was already excavated as well as Roedelius's solo work.
The Resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of Cultures in Berlin.
Public money, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of the British ancestor and the manual "Krautrock Sampler" is also present.
Also present is Loveparade’s innovator, Dr. Motte.
All this roughly outlines the effect of krautrock on the next pop music era.
In this respect, Harmonia fills the space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno’s statement, along with the most unusual sounds, floats in the hall: “The only true music is his, the future.”
There are pictures depicting the producer with Harmonia in the room of a farmhouse.
The projection of additional black and white photographs of tangled wired equipment serves to build legends.
In the foreground, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are attached to the organ and drum kit with the intention of distributing sound effects that have not been heard from the instruments with the help of instruments that produce their own escalated sound effects.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three tech-savvy craftsmen.
Even the house choir doesn’t change anything.
They cough and kiss under Barbara Morgenstern, and in a beautiful part they sing "Aaaaaaaaa!" with a sense of touch.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought after in the blues than in music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk) or in escaping artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If you cry '68,' you are not on the wrong path, and Harmonia still does not allow you to turn away from your rest.
Even the most self-explanatory thing is carefully thought out on stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can make you nervous, or give you the passing moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
Through "Hunting" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films once again deal with the Balkan War.
None of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too much for action and shooting, or too sentimental.
Even Richard Gere himself can't help that in "Hunting."
First of all, the good news: Although the two war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they found the actor Richard Gere again in the dark backland of the Bosnian war.
In recent times, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, as the many good-boy-nothing roles he played in emotional films for women and the many press conferences he gave on Buddhism have taken away even the desire to look at him.
And suddenly, Richard Gere is the strongest argument for maybe watching "Hunting."
It provides a wonderful, smiling performance: Basically, the war correspondent Simon Hunt would have been what Gere would have been if fate and the film industry hadn’t been so kind to him: A man who had long left his best years behind, but whose decline as a ruinous monument still preserved much of his former attractiveness.
However, the film "Hunting" and the German production of "Mörderischer Frieden", which began to be screened this week, continue an endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian woman from snipers in Kosovo, and one of them suddenly falls in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that the Serbs are not once portrayed as the sole cause of all evil, the film bearing the shallowness of TV movies is lost too quickly in shootings and eventful scenes.
It's a Cobra 11 character with a war instead of a highway.
On the other hand, it is exemplary in the case of "Hunting" why no really good film has been made about the war in the Balkans.
The story of three U.S. war correspondents who go up to find the Serbian war criminal "Fox" with another director, another screenwriter (both in Richard Shepard's personal union) might have turned into a new "Apocalypse Now" in a different era.
After all, the stories have a surprising similarity: In both cases, small groups are pushing into the woods to accomplish what the army is unable to do – and in both cases, the journey is going crazy.
One of the reasons for the downfall of "Hunting" is that he simply won't let Simon Hunt become the depraved cynic who listens to his heart as he initially introduces him.
No, and in addition to the script, he spends a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
"The Hunt" is finally over when the reporters in the last five minutes of the film accelerated to what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have been unable to do in five years: capture the war criminal and hand him over to the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that one would prefer to go to the International Tribunal for the Hague for a crime against the logic of cinema.
The purpose of the film is deeply human.
He intends to assert that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (in this they are said to be exceptionally united) that they are not pursuing the persecution intensively enough because of secret political deals.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar that you think of a famous Brecht poem.
In it, the poet writes of the wooden mask depicting an Asian demon on his desk: "I stare at his temple with celebration at the crumbling vascular that reveals how tiring it is to be evil."
Movies like Hunting have the same oversized, human-headed masks that show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the war in the Balkans.
Recently, the newspaper reported that all Hollywood films about Iraq were a nasty failure.
We can say that there hasn’t been a good movie about South Africa yet.
Almost always true: If a star wanders through the world’s crisis spots or minefields, something like “The Paths of Freedom” with Patricia Arquette, “Without Borders” with Angelina Jolie, or “Blood Diamond” with Leonardo Di Caprio emerges.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close to time.
After all, it took decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust with the film "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably still be enough - since the classics of the Vietnam War, such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket", were not celebrated unanimously as masterpieces in their time.
But it is conceivable that these days, when all the mass murders come to our homes in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the conflicts in the world.
And it deprives screenwriters of the reality they need to tell good stories.
After all, “To be or not to be” or “The Dictator” was so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn’t know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't be looking for the right thing if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we should get into the sarcastically distant artistic vision of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel The Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re Lexicon and the Balkan War, he replied: "It only depends on the fact that certain things never change.
The big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be killed in terrible ways, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust is heavily criticized for resigning from Olympics
The mayor’s resignation from his bid to host the Hamburg Summer Olympics has sparked fierce criticism in political and economic life.
Many want to continue to fight for the water games.
Von Beust, however, strongly warns of the realities in the course of the probabilities.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said the retreat was "unfavourable to the economic environment" on Wednesday.
No other project in the city has recently unleashed such a powerful motivational force as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, we would not be able to keep the momentum of sporting policy steady.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative “based on modified time coordinates.”
Mayor Ole von Beust has insisted that Hamburg’s ambitions for the Olympic Games are not realistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation on the Munich bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, which was expected in early December.
“By favoring this, for us, we will not have a realistic chance in the period until 2028 that we have planned so far.”
But we will not give up the dream for good, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sport Federation (HSB) has expressed regret at the statements made by von Beust.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to apply for the Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
"It's too early to miss an opportunity to bury our plans now," HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
Moreover, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at a reception held at the general meeting of the General German College Sports Association.
There, the application submitted to the city of Von Beust Hamburg for the 2015 Universiade described it as not serving as a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association launched Hamburg as a participating city just last week.
The SPD's civilian faction blamed the Senate for leaving valuable time unused for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been postponed for years by the Senate because it voted for the Olympics and did not build a home," SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast said in a statement.
While the SPD consistently advocated an integrated plan for the Olympic and subsequent residential exploitation of Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU unilaterally focused on the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games sparked a lot of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's crates.
Anyone who connects the concepts of Sweden and the wooden box is thinking of Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden crates manufactured in Sweden cast a dark shadow on the list of Warhol’s works.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm-type" Brillo Box listed here are fake.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes, the internal investigation of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now come to a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo Boxes" that were donated to Moderna Museet by Pontus Hultén in 1995 are also part of the "Brillo Boxes" on the international art market.
The prehistory is a long and complicated chain of artistic and curatorial stunts.
In 1964, Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxai" in New York - painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white shape of the soap powder cardboard box of "Brillo".
At an exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol's consent, hundreds of Brillo boxes were exhibited: These (for cost-saving reasons) were not from Warhol, but were transported directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their templates, simple exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol gave permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wood canes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the era now speak of about fifteen crates that, at the time, were authenticated as the Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the designation "Stockholm type" and rightfully entered art and auction history.
Some of them were auctioned for over <0x24>100,000.
The problem, however, is that the legendary museum director, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that in 1968 around a hundred wooden crates were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which were then left to him by Warhol.
In fact, the 105 chests of Hultén were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
In addition to the six Brillo Boxes owned by the museum, Lars Byström, the main monument manager at Moderna Museet, examined three Swedish privately owned boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed chipboards were first flattened and polished, and then applied the white oil paint with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, indicates that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard with a paint roller without a foundation - and it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authenticated by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "Unless the New York's 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will include the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition materials."
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that it would investigate “serious allegations” of soap-powder crates.
Since then, however, they have been enveloped in unrelenting silence.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Give Up
Soldiers barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can’t take responsibility for the bloodshed, said Antonio Trillanes, the hotel’s manager, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Prior to this, the hotel had been stormed by government soldiers using tear gas.
Two dozen soldiers have barricaded themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team were tried on Thursday for the failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly untie 30 sympathizers.
The military police responsible for guarding the man apparently switched to him and joined the riot.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government-faith units have sealed off the area around the prestigious hotel.
The president called the security cabinet for an emergency meeting.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the military's actions.
"They're tired of people," Trillanes said.
“We urge people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who had previously been the commander of the Scout Rangers elite, stated that other units of the army wanted to join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government have called for strong protests against the president on Friday.
His government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for several months.
The financial district of Manila was the main stage of the rebellion against Arroyo in 2003, organized by around 200 members of the military.
The uprising failed after just 24 hours, when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of its shares in Versatel.
As the company said on Wednesday evening, the average price per share is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14.46.
This represents 20.05 per cent of the share capital.
There were speculations about the takeover before that.
The possibility of increasing the ownership in Versatel remains open.
This move is intended to help consolidate the German DSL market, according to United Internet.
Before that, on Wednesday, assumptions were made about a possible connection, after Berenberg Bank increased its share of the network operator in Düsseldorf by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution only reserves the share to a third party, it is reported in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet already owned nearly 10 percent of the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch has issued 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million shares for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.4 million.
In addition, the companies launched a dialogue on cooperation on the launch of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a spokesperson for United-Internet said.
The two companies jointly established the MSP joint venture to take over the competitor Freenet.
The two companies are initially satisfied with a good ten percent stake in Freenet and will not exercise their right to take over an additional 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet reported on Thursday.
The two companies, however, leave all options open, in particular to increase their shareholding in Freenet AG.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The poker game around Freenet, which has been going on for months and is no longer easy to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contracted mobile phone customers and 1.27 million DSL and landline customers.
United Internet and Drillisch hold a 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
There is now an agreement that Drillisch will bring in another round 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of Vatas investment company was agreed in August.
