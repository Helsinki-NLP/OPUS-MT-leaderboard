Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed with mental illness, and now she’s making art on the subject – “Man should have the right to his own body”
Dozens of patient stories are hanging from the ceiling of the Project room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.
They all have Camille Auer's name on them.
The papers tell a long story of how outsiders have written down their interpretations of Auer and his identity.
They decided for him who he was.
"I wanted to share my personal history of treatment to make the violence of the process visible," Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the gender reassignment process.
It is often a period of years of research that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to the diagnostic examinations for “gender identity disorder” that are carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before that, he had used the estrogen he had ordered via the Internet and was already very advanced in his own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process in order to be able to correct the sex legally.
Trans law (563/2002) obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilisation in order to get the correct sex, for example, to the population register centre and passport.
At present, everyone who corrects their sex is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of infertility.
Man has the right to decide his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and a violation of human rights," Auer said.
The reform of the Translaw has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations on the law, and the European Court of Human Rights has issued a preliminary ruling obliging the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared the amendment of the Act under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
Elections came and the Finns Party rose to the government.
The law change is back in place again.
These are domestic political disputes that are not even related to this law.
“The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law,” said Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty International’s Finland department.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines Auer uses.
In the Patient Report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by the transpoli psychologist at Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met with Camille Auer twice and based on these, he wrote a report that would define Auer’s right to treatment and assistance.
The perception of the reality being studied appears to be vulnerable to instability.
The subject’s perception of themselves appears to be fragmented at the level of the boundary state, and the instability of personality is emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," Auer says.
It was even more shocking when Auer was not given gender reassignment treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the TV in the waiting room of the transpole.
Later, that television produced a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but a diagnosis is needed to remove the breasts," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel you are anything other than a defined number of your gender at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not the only one of its kind.
For many, the sex-correction process is more severe for mental reasons than purely medical operations.
Those who go through it will meet dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy to deny care to people who need help and support because they don’t have enough resources,” Auer said.
Many people who have applied for the process have underlying psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
Based on these considerations, the medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be started.
“Blocking treatment and assistance can put a person in an even worse position than it was before the process began,” Auer says.
Auer’s personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts all my adult life and that is something that people usually find difficult to digest."
The depression has been treated with medication, and when Auer started taking hormones, he felt better.
He had finally been able to spell out the feelings that had existed since childhood and teenage years.
Why the broad chin didn’t seem to fit into my body and why my chest muscles had to be round instead of flat.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people around him who can see him.
Becoming seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving," he says.
Nowadays, Auer feels that she is already seen, she exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, the random comments of loved ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when people close to you are sexually abused.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they don't agree or are unable to internalize it," he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, a body conflict in which the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, there can be no official confirmation of their own sex.
"There is no medical justification for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament approved a new procedure for the recognition of the legal gender.
The new legislation is based on self-determination of the legal sex.
The adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identification number, stating that he/she feels that he/she is of the other sex.
After a six-month reflection period, the applicant confirms his/her application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity code.
This right of self-determination is also demanded in Finland, and Auer’s exhibition is also encapsulated in this demand.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist; the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has a weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.
Camille Auer’s exhibition Antiphalic Dick 4.-28.7.2017 in the Project Room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Citizens' rights group issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National Association for African American Civil Rights (NAACP) has issued a travel alert for Missouri due to discriminatory practices and racist attacks in the state.
“The NAACP’s Missouri Travel Notice comes into force on August 28, 2017, and urges African-American tourists, visitors, and locals to pay special attention and extreme caution when traveling in a state that has recently experienced a number of questionable racial events,” the agency said in a statement.
The recent entry into force of a law in Missouri makes it more difficult to bring discrimination cases to justice, and the implementation of state laws disproportionately targets minorities, which, according to the NAACP, led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin color and beaten or killed," NAACP Missouri president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in so short a time."
The Missouri travel alert is the first U.S. state warning issued by the organization.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and was arrested by the Missouri police, even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to a report by the Missouri Attorney General that police were 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white driver.
“The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be alert and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People have to prepare themselves, for example, by taking money to pay bail or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, the sixteenth most in the United States.
The travel alert is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it difficult for companies to sue for discrimination in housing and employment.
The Constitutional Civil Rights Organization (ACLU) recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had passed immigration laws obliging the police to arrest people for immigration offences, which, according to the organization, increases racial profiling.
Generally, travel alerts are issued by the State Department and apply to other states, but have recently been issued by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the CEO’s supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (Centre) who is responsible for state ownership steering has asked Finnair for an explanation of the supplementary pension contribution received by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
This is in contradiction with the state’s declaration of intent.
The EUR 130,000 supplementary pension received by Vauramo came to the fore this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that it would give up its supplementary pensions in 2013.
The government has stated that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year’s decision on ownership steering.
Sanctions immediately tightened the speeches.
Until recently, relations between the United States and Russia seemed to be moving from cold to warm.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to get along well at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions approved by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday reacted bitterly in Russia.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the sanctions bill signed by Trump meant “a full-scale trade war.”
Even if the Russian reactions were offset only by political rhetoric, the escalation between the US and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon after Trump’s election.
In the United States, the passing of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was not easy.
The law was approved by Congress with considerable unanimity, but the president was told that it was much more difficult to pass the law.
Trump criticized the law as “significantly inadequate.”
President Trump’s bluntness may have been caused by Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting one’s own prerogatives must also have been repulsive.
As is well known, an investigation is underway in the United States into Russia’s possible interference in the presidential elections as well as the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia.
The tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
With the staff of the White House changing frequently and various scandalous twists and turns being revealed almost updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is being conducted in the United States not under the leadership of the president, but despite the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship between Russia and the United States is turbulent, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea also tightens relations.
The EU has prominently raised the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy towards Russia, at least on the top, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member state like Finland that trades a lot with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real pain.
The impact of the U.S. sanctions is still unclear.
There are fears in the EU that sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the fact that, for example, liquid natural gas, which is important for the US economy, has been excluded from the sanctions.
In global politics, trade sanctions are a means of expressing disapproval.
Economic sanctions must, however, be well-considered and rigorous.
Otherwise, they will easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump’s White House now has a Statue of Liberty in its sights
Interfering with the statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as anyone else: the Iraqis, along with American soldiers, overthrew a statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the top ideologists in the Trump administration, was well aware of what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN’s Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a rhetoric about the president’s proposal to drastically reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge hordes of cruise organizers and characters imitating the Statue of Liberty.
The object of his attack was the significance of the statue, and in particular the fact that in 1903 a poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the statue’s base – 17 years after its completion.
“I don’t want to go into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the whole world.
The poem was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller was not wrong, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
The key is the touching words of Lazarus, the only one of its kind, in which the state calls not only immigrants but “the poorest of the poor”: “Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched reminder of your theming shore.”
The poem is more topical than ever.
Miller was not a literary critic; he made it clear that the “poorest of the poor” are not welcome in Trump’s United States.
The controversy about the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural controversy about the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue's footsteps, well aware that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the connections between French and American republicanism with a classic symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiles.
The inclusion of the poem in the image was an ingenious feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on the American nationalist ideal.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh, who can now be seen as some sort of prediction of Trump, claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not present an invitation to anyone, but is an early pioneer of neo-conservatives taking the torch of the United States into a darkened world: “Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
He's taking the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States.”
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The significance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on perspective.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
That’s not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not show the way, but it incites the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made it to the UK national team
Neil Black, Executive Vice President of the British Athletics Federation, says the 16 members of the Scottish national team participating in the World Championships are a “significant confirmation.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, “there’s something special going on in Scotland that British athletics has to learn from.”
"This is welcome, and we will continue to explore it for as long as we understand what it is all about," Black said.
"I talked to representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation believes that it is related to the activities of the association,
and the British Athletics Federation believes that their actions are behind it.
And the average person on the street thinks he has something to do with it.
It’s a great thing, whatever it is.”
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000-metre race, and Eilidh Doyle was chosen as captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
"His captain's speech was incredible," Black said.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and highly motivated, no matter where they happen to live and practice.
“Eilidh’s words had a genuine feeling and passion for sport.”
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist at the Commonwealth Championships in the 400-metre hurdles, and this is her fifth World Championship.
The previous record was seven in 1983 and 2015.
Medium-distance runner Laura Muir has set five UK and two European records in the past year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London and is well worth watching: he has an excellent season, including winning the British World Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scot on the team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "very proud" to have so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for final positions and medals.
"Captainship is a great honor, but it's even more special because the national team members voted for the captain," Doyle said.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for prizes.
The captain's speech?
I think it went well.
I was focused on how lucky we are to have our home games.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing.”
Facebook: Don’t run for public office if you can’t stand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for everything from possible domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism must have annoyed me.
But he did not silence his critics.
“If freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led as dumb and silent as sheep to be slaughtered,” Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked those who posted them.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was downplayed online as well.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the remarkably popular Republican governor of the Democratic-dominated state.
He has been ranked second among 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to hot dogs.
He has led the state steadfastly and held firmly to the principles.
He has also skilfully used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and published a picture of a bald head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users entering the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax funds.
Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, saying it was only a matter of moderating comments.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their chosen leaders, not trolls, but educators, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They said their comments were respectful, considerate and respectful.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely commented on my disappointment that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the Washington Post.
“I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately seen as an organized group and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.”
The governor's staff called the comments a "centralized attack". Someone else might call them "promoting what is considered important."
In the age of Facebook, it is easy to manage communication by blocking a critic or deleting a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
It’s the same thing, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was taken in Virginia last week.
Judge James C. Cacheris of the Alexandria District Court said the Loudoun County government violated the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by blocking a voter from Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Liberties Union went to talk to Kentucky’s Republican Governor Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
At the time of Washington, low-cost postal charges had a similar effect to the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers beat up Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
The pseudonyms Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers defaming Washington’s decisions.
The President's office received petitions criticizing the Jay agreement, the U.S.-British cooperation, trade and shipping agreement, according to documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
Summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about half a dozen places, plus online announcements of a couple, three.
Most of them have come from southern and southwestern Finland, but then also from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki,” says Marja Isomursu, a specialist researcher at Evira.
Green flies have died from a parasite called trichomonose.
It is caused by a protozoan known as Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike pigeons, and especially the poodle.
In the 21st century, however, the disease began to be detected in finch birds.
In 2009, it went really well.
At that time, trichomonose caused a large collapse in the Finnish green finch population, after which the species’ populations have been recovering.
There have now been, but at least not yet on a large scale, sick greenfinches, says Juha Honkala, museum manager at the Central Museum of Natural History (Loomus) at the University of Helsinki.
There are fears that the previous green finch epidemic will recur if nothing is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop feeding the birds in the summer immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from homefield advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European top player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from a home pitch advantage for the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty, from Northern Ireland, led the tournament at Archerfield Links next door last year before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has been fond of the new venue and acts as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event, it will get to its full glory," Rafferty says.
"The players see the field at its best. It's in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He is a keen ambassador of the game, and he is proud of what he has done here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field.”
Englishman Eales defends the championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenger Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a very special occasion," says the Southport player.
“I couldn’t defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament isn’t part of this year’s tour.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
“Last year’s memories come back to me: the tournament win was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a wonderful time that we will always remember.”
Gary Orr is back in action on his own soil, and he joined the tour earlier this year at the age of 50.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Gaming in the home is always more meaningful than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I enjoyed playing again and played very hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The three will be accompanied by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry to the tournament is free. Parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 if there is only a driver in the car and <0xC2><0xA3>10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Possible indoor air problems in the barracks were investigated in Säkylä
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori brigade, at least so far, the brigade said on Thursday.
Indoor air surveys will continue.
The investigation began when a man who had stopped his military service for health reasons assumed that his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air in the barracks.
According to Col. Mika Holma, the Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, there have been no problems with the health of the other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an individual case, and that no one else who served in that unit had any health problems.
Every notification is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter thoroughly.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problem, Holma says.
The brigade’s statement says that due to the arrival of the July batch, the barracks had to move goods, which may have caused a temporary increase in dustiness.
The air may therefore have seemed saturated, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold country
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove to cook.
He rarely uses the pottery.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the restless province of Papua, Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato – locally “nota” – directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the burnt sweet potato is eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
Degei’s home has no furniture, and he sits on a muddy floor, where he usually also does his daily chores, such as washing in the turbid water he gets from a nearby swamp.
Toilet posts are provided by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Degei is the youngest of his four wives, and he is not appointed to care for the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink a lot, and the soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares to walk around the village after five in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the Papuan highlands, a former Dutch colony annexed to Indonesia in 1969, which was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its hatred to the government in Jakarta, which controls the area tightly and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The trip to Enarotali begins with a one and a half hour flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabire, and continues with a five-hour drive in a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
With a population of about 19,000, the city has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, whose corrugated roofs have been stained with rust.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have taken place.
"We didn't have any clothes like this," Degei says. He means his colorful, hand-woven wrap headgear, dark skirt and bright-colored blouse.
“In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, with child mortality and illiteracy among the highest in Asia.
It is also the gold of Indonesia.
Paniai is an upland area about the size of New Jersey, with a population of 153,000. Just about a hundred kilometers from Pania is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company domiciled in Phoenix, U.S.A.
In 2015, the mine generated <0x24>3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
Papua has an estimated <0x24>78 billion in wood reserves.
For Papuan people, however, these riches bring misery, as they mean the repressive presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid almost <0x24>20 million to local military personnel and military units between 1998 and 2004, with individual officers paid up to <0x24>150,000.
Papua’s demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
Human rights activists say that since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 Papuan people and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the massacres in the Papuan highlands in the 1970s became a genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in peaceful protests in the region.
A 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, We Will Lose Everything, contains reports of atrocities in the previous year, including extrajudicial executions, torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular means – and ruthless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims because there are cases every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as the natural resources of Papua attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% are Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslims move from the Indonesian populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi to the region in the hope of a better livelihood.
Javan warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mix in peanut sauce.
It is difficult for locals to compete.
“Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables on the market at a lower price than locals,” says 24-year-old Abeth You from Pania, who moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their clients."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address the injustices and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 districts, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 districts, including Pania, on his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," you said.
Pania experienced some kind of wavebed only two months after Jokow’s inauguration in October.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by the fire at Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
Scared children told soldiers that they should use headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, the children were captured and beaten with rifles by drunken soldiers.
So one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma after being beaten.
A few hours later, the State Electoral Commission building near the scene of the incident was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand Papuan people —young men and women and children— gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They had their ceremonial hunting bows with them, and they began to perform the traditional Papuan Mee Pago waita dance, dancing in a circle and imitating bird singing.
Some of the protesters began stoning police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers received a command in the internal radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document seen by the TIME magazine, which has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a resident leader of the Kego Koto area, sensed that the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"A number of gunshots were fired."
Alfius Youw was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shooting.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," Yohanes told TIME, sadly. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were just “protecting” the police station because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papuan police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"Then it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising that the violence in Papua would be addressed.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately, so that nothing like this will ever happen again."
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said he would launch an extrajudicial investigation into human rights violations.
He immediately began to withdraw his speeches.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate violations, but certain processes are needed to do so," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind, saying that he did not intend to start an investigation in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity" and the deaths of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been clarified, including the events in Paniai.
The families of the Paniai victims are deeply distrustful of the allegations.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed in any way," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired of this."
He says he still lives in fear, even though it has been years.
"Yes, I am afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid they'll shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians are afraid to discuss the event.
He said he had been beaten by soldiers after helping to bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers were looking for me after the burial of the victims," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot and killed villagers in the neighbouring area of Paniai, Deiyai.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, who refused to take the man who had lost consciousness to the hospital, including children.
A 24-year-old man in need of hospital care, Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in the water while fishing on a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
Police said the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
However, according to locals, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We're terrified. We're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought in for treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for the police officers who shot at them to be held accountable and for a mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real development fuels dissatisfaction with the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes, who live in Papua’s savage central highlands.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels claiming to defend the rights of the Papuan people through random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of OPM’s leaders are from Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "safeguarding national sovereignty".
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among the Papuan people, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty fuels dissatisfaction.
There is very little rice for sale at Enarotal, and it is too expensive for the locals, too.
Just like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman can be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, disparities in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
Jobs are scarce and tend to go to better-educated and wealthier migrants locally.
Few beans have enough capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work and no money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Pania Tribal Council.
The remote Papua remains understated in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Bastille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare filming licence, the official reason being an inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokowi has not kept his election promises, has not increased transparency and has not contributed to development by lifting the restrictions on news coverage.
"Reporters reporting in the turbulent eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua in Indonesia face new risks: refusal of visas and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government is under pressure only from its immediate neighbours in Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the “number of widespread violations” in Papua, including the Pania shooting.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papuan Liberation Movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights violations."
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When a Dutch official delegation led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapur on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, according to an anonymous source who took part in the meeting.
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019, but the popes say they are unlikely to vote for Jokow anymore.
“Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are involved in the Pania shooting scene,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panians: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in need and poverty, with virtually no access to health care and education.
According to Gobai, the Panians, like the rest of the Beans, regard the votes they give to Jokow as "debts" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Pania shooting once again demonstrated their opposition in a symbolic way: they buried one of the victims in a country opposite a police station and an army station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let the responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says with his head bent.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora says Robert Helenius' rematch canceled: "Even his own fans don't want to see it"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight in the Hartwall Arena on May 27.
The game was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora puts Helenius entirely on the flop of the rematch.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn’t my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was because of my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don’t want to see him fight because he’s miserable, Chisora is bored.
Helenius and Chisora first met in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
Ticket sales for the rematch went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanomi in May that the match had been postponed to autumn.
Nothing new has been heard from the game since.
However, the withdrawal no longer annoys Chisora.
In any event, the game would have to be cancelled after Chisora became ill.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up with a lot of pain.
My sternum was about to explode.
“The hospital said I had to be operated on,” Chisora said.
The UK is currently in about 45 percent condition.
He doesn't seem to be interested in a rematch with Helenius, but Dillian Whyte.
Chisora was defeated by Whyte in December.
Fire strikes Torch skyscraper in Dubai
The flames seized one of the world’s tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday, and hundreds of residents were forced to flee from the 337-metre-high 79-story building.
This was already the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called Torch, a torch.
The building was evacuated, and no one was known to be injured, and the cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the incident.
“We were asleep and woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took us about ten minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Rescue Department, the firefighters were able to put out the fire at 4 a.m. local time and stayed to cool the building.
The government said it would provide accommodation for those who left their homes.
The incident may raise new questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior surfaces of high-rise buildings around the world.
The Torch building’s board of directors commissioned a study after the fire in 2015, which found that the boards used for facade cladding and insulation were the most damaged.
In the United Kingdom, police believe that the insulation and cladding panels on the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid progress of the flames in the fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot during the night.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu between 9 p.m. on Tuesday and 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was called Sky Team Monkey.
The colour is red and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found on Thursday.

More than 20 percent of U.S. air passengers take prohibited items on board, survey reveals
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had consciously or unknowingly taken prohibited items on board aircraft past TSA checkpoints, while at least six percent of passengers had knives or other items with blades that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one per cent said they only found out afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey, conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, was answered by more than 1,000 passengers and revealed that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
Of the passengers who deliberately violated the TSA rules, 19.7% were from Generation Y and less than 15% were from Generation X.
The most common violations were the introduction of food and liquids into the aircraft.
More than 3% of women and 3.7 percent of men admitted to knowingly taking prohibited drugs on board the aircraft.
The company wanted to find out how many people had accidentally carried smuggling goods past security checks and how many people had done so knowingly.
It is not surprising that the most travelers are also most likely to pass through security – knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey notes, TSA’s guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids are allowed on board the aircraft and how much.
So it’s no surprise that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For a while, there was also the belief that books should not be taken on an airplane.
You can take liquids on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, has rescheduled his decision to delay Obama’s decision to cut emissions.
The day after 15 states had sued Scott Pruitt, the director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of smog-reducing decisions made under Obama.
According to Pruitt, the change demonstrates that the agency he manages is taking better account of the needs of environmental decision-makers in the states than in previous administrations.
Pruitt made no mention of the action brought against her earlier decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
States should start complying with the ground level of ozone as of 1 October 2015.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by one year so that his agency would have more time to familiarize itself with the plan, as the agency "does not want to interfere in local decision-making or impede economic growth."
Pruitt was the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him head of the EPA. Pruitt is known for his opposition to stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change of heart on Wednesday is the latest setback to Pruitt’s plan to soften the regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration’s decision on oil and gas companies, obliging the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his reversal of ozone regulations would only strengthen the EPA’s cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on schedule.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to sue it, where they will reach an agreement on timelines," Pruitt said. In his previous post, he sued the Environmental Protection Agency more than ten times.
“We don’t believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us."
However, the EPA statement stated that Pruitt could continue to use "its power to delay the execution of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions are "justified and based on the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations.
The bill, which was passed last month, aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the EPA’s federal consortium this week, said the group would continue to press.
“The change of heart in the EPA as a result of our lawsuits is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing difficulties for sensitized groups of people and is also a contributing cause of thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists were delighted by Pruitt’s sudden change of direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy in charge of our breathing air use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight the Trump administration, whose ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interested groups.”
Supercar manufacturer to come up with SUV - "it's happening in Ferrari style"
It will also invest in hybrid sports cars while maintaining its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari’s style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All cases of measles in Eastern Savo are of the same virus type
Measles infection in Rantasalmi is of the same virus type as previous cases in Eastern Savo, according to the THL.
The virological laboratory of the National Institute for Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savo is the same virus strain as previous infections.
The THL has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July in a person from the Straits of Finland is of the same virus type as the previous cases in Eastern Savo.
On the basis of this information, all the infections detected in East Savo relate to the first measles outbreak in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not discovered any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may emerge after the fifth patient until mid-August, and therefore the epidemic is not yet over, says Dr. Mirkaleena Erkkilä, who is responsible for the infectious diseases in Soster’s primary health care.
No new measles outbreaks or suspicions have emerged since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä points out.

Finland prepares for authorised screaming
The soup wasn't even considered legal.
The background argument is that the process, along with liquor, produces methanol, which is toxic.
Making shrimp at home will be legal next year, but the legalization of the soup with chips will not even be considered.
The shrimp is made by fermentation, the chips by distillation.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that the process, along with alcohol, produces methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to make the soup of the chips a universal right, Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry was preparing the reform of the Alcohol Act, distillation of chips was not considered for legalisation.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, says Outi Mäkelä (MEP).
He is in the negotiating group of the parliamentary groups of government parties, who took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Permission to distill chips at home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Tuominen says that there will be a simple rule for making alcoholic beverages at home: you can make alcohol at home by fermentation.
This means that besides beer, cider and wine, you can now legally make a scream at home.
The government wanted to simplify the rules.
The new law removes the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and enables the production of screams, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must be carried out in such a way that the raw materials, or the flavourings and flavourings resulting from their fermentation, are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, you can make as many drinks as you like, and you can give your own alcohol as a gift.
It should not be put on sale.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change took place in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be heard by Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session was held on 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament has already taken a position, Mäkelä is pleased.
Oscar Pistorius rushed to hospital with armed guards
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to a South African hospital for suspected heart attack.
Pistorius has already left the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving a prison sentence in Atteridgeville.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning, accompanied by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but he was discharged from the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examinations.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Translated phone conversations reveal Trump pressure on Mexico to build border wall
The U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have leaked phone conversations to the Washington Post.
In a phone call on January 27, 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto to stop his public speech about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reproached Nieto for publicly knocking out the wall project. “You can’t say that to the press,” Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a transcript of Trump’s first phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump told Turnbull that an agreement that the United States would accept refugees on their way to Australia is "laughing," "sad," and "stupid." According to Trump, the deal negotiated under Obama would make him look like a "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant call of the whole day.”
Georgia massacre: Activists reintroduce racist lynching in hope of justice
A Ford Mercury car overtakes a crowd in a small town in Monroe, Georgia, and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver, and four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
A middle-aged man, dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and stares through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man yells.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence as a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-scene, which was aired on July 22, 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the hanging loop is tied to the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to stage the events of 1946, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested in these years – even though the murderers are living among us and many need to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps arrange the re-enactment.
“It is a stain of shame in history, but above all, it is a burden that weighs on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former Georgian congressman.
For him, the re-enactment is a startling call to action, and it also reminds the Monroe people that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the perpetrators to be brought to justice, we want things to finally be brought to a close, we want to recover from grief and make up, but above all, we want justice," Brooks says.
"We cannot recover and reconcile until we have justice."
The body of the victim of the Georgia massacre is covered by a coroner on July 27, 1946.
According to NBC news reports, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
However, no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say the motives for the lynching have always been locally known: politics and sex.
In 1946, the state of Georgia was granted the right to vote for the first time in the presidential election by the Supreme Court, which ruled in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, during the election, a black farmer, Roger Malcom, stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcom’s wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the town rumored that Hester had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her.
On July 25, 1946, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom’s <0x24>600 bail against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
A crowd stopped their car before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," the FBI said in a statement.
"It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a voter murder," he said.
“They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to black people that the same would happen to them if they were to vote.”
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-enactment of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
It is an extremely realistic and captivating performance, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared in today's United States.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to watch what Greene says it's meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark side," the director says.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you can't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals for this year’s performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and twenty whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been playing the local Ku Klux Klan leader for years, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh said.
"It is important, however, that this aspect of history be kept on the forefront, so that it will never be repeated again."
On the other side of the room are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, and he's furious that Hester has been having an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me? I told you to get off my land, n---u!"
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
And then there's the punch.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit you too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene says.
"I just don't think white people used the word n---u at the time."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang. You need to use a longer version."
The subject of the show is unpleasant, but the room is powered by the spirit of a friend.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the show, but to honor the memory of those who were killed.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are blatant.
No one's laughing.
The re-enactment ends quickly and violently.
Screams, shots, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands beside the bodies and sings the Billie Holiday Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks for every second word.
A few tens of meters away, about fifty viewers wipe their eyes with sweat and tears.
Almost half of the audience is black and half is white.
Among them are a couple who have come to see a show about Ithaca in New York State, but most of them are locals.
With Brooks' guidance, they have visited the victims' graves in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have turned the story into reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children crouch to look at fake blood and immovable bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actors who played lynxes take off their cloaks and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man who plays the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a rough performance.
"It's okay," the woman in the show comforts me.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and the actors gather for a joint dinner.
A white couple who arrived from Altanta discusses the performance vividly with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when she describes the feelings that the performance arouses.
“It’s hard to listen to horrible words and watch horrible things being said and done by people who look the same as you—just because they look the same as you,” she says.
"The performance made me realize that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for the listeners sitting at the same table.
He said he has already started planning for next year’s show.
“Replay is a powerful experience because it depicts the horrors we experience, but it’s also an educational experience,” Brooks says.
“The message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.”
Removing Vegetables in Stores: That’s How Much You Really Save by Removing “Extra Parts”
Is it allowed to remove cauliflower leaves in the store before weighing?
How about taking out the big hat from the pineapple - no matter how much it weighs?
The answers strongly divide: for one, it is a sign of extreme anesthesia, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that are not used and yet go to the garbage at home.
This phenomenon can be seen in shops.
For example, the vegetable department of K-Citymarket in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, has cardboard boxes because many people tear off the leaf parts of, for example, cauliflower.
From the box, the leaves are exported to the biowaste.
According to a news report published by economic news outlets, snooping at the vegetable counter surprises merchants.
But how much does removing excess parts of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How important is this snooping method really?
We Women tested how the price changes when pineapple, artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower take the leaves or strains off.
Cauliflower: The cost of cauliflower, which costs 2.10 euros, was 1.80 euros when all the leaves were peeled off.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.30 fell to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.95 when its stock was twisted away.
Top artichoke: 2.60 euros cost 2.40 euros, as the short stock was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and without a heel 80 cents.
The result: If the leaves and strains start to pluck off, you can save a few tens of cents for one vegetable at best.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 per cent.
This would have saved a total of <0x24>1.20!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona after five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, according to AFP.
Earlier Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a buy-out price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to FC Barcelona.
The transfer amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million is the largest in football history.
The record was set by Manchester United last summer for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million for Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league blocked the move earlier Thursday after it rejected Neymar’s first payment attempt.
According to the rules of the league, the club that buys cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player has to buy out the contract himself, which is done by wagering money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be introduced to a potential new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa to look into details
In addition, Barcelona said in a statement that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association (UEFA) so that the association could determine the disciplinary measures that might result from the incident.
Spanish league president Javier Tebas has accused PSG of violating UEFA’s rules of financial fairness.
UEFA can penalize a club that makes more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million in losses over a three-year period.
According to UEFA, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its financial obligations.
Neymar’s transfer to PSG will affect the club’s finances for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell a number of players for substantial amounts of money, UEFA said.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a Qatari state-owned company.
The club is chaired by former tennis pro Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.

Austin, 21, severely burned after lightning strike, flash recorded on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing regular work on an airplane at Southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues when suddenly a lightning strike from the rainy sky hit the plane.
The power of lightning threw Dunn to the ground near the wing of the plane.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and told me that my brother had been electrocuted and that he was in the hospital.
I asked if he was still alive, Austin’s sister Autumn said.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and a brain hemorrhage.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport’s representative, the lightning-risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the carrier decides whether or not to comply with it.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
British education group Pearson announced Friday that it will cut 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when it launches a new restructuring program in response to pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the job cuts will mainly be made at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. The company has already cut 4,000 jobs in connection with previous restructurings.
Pearson announced a further <0xC2><0xA3>300 million cut in May as part of its third austerity programme to revive business weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged. Its net sales increased by 1% in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Kabul escort attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military escort in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others.
According to NATO, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local information, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, the blast on Thursday evening occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked by a "person-carrying self-propelled explosive device".
The statement said that all the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the Taliban's strengthening and the presence of ISIS in Qarabagh are of major concern to NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing in Kabul, a region that is predominantly inhabited by Shia Muslims.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, in central Kabul, more than 150 people were killed in the bombing, which was the country's most devastating militant grouping attack since the U.S.-led forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to postpone implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken during the Obama administration to reduce smog-causing emissions a day after 15 states had sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called “ozone determinations” late Wednesday, demonstrating its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," Scott Pruitt, director of the agency, said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency’s intention to postpone the implementation of ozone measurements by one year to October 2018. According to the definitions, smog pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in line with increasingly stringent air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 mostly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, which said the suspension was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has been looking for ways to soften Barack Obama’s environmental regulations, saying the measures are part of a broader agenda for economic growth.
Trump’s measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists, who are concerned about the health effects of rising emissions.
According to the EPA website, inhaling ozone-containing air “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders of ISIL had also sent building blocks of the bomb to Sydney.
The bomb was supposed to be transported to the plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before the security check.
The police did not explain why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that emits toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as public transport.
Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said the plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation continues.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels performed well
Oil refiner Neste’s profit before taxes fell, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Managing Director Matti Lievonen, the company achieved good results in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products reached record levels and the development of the EBIT of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017,” Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomchenko discuss possible match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future, weighing less than 66.7 kg, met each other on Thursday for the first time.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel in Los Angeles until WBC's unbeatable lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomatchenko, the WBO's upper featherweight champion.
Garcia defeated former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday by unanimous decision, and since then Garcia and Lomatchenko have been in the top five on the list of boxers in different weight classes.
Garcia held out her right hand and asked, "How are you, Master?
Good luck in the game!”
Lomatchenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN Saturday at 7:00 a.m.
When the duo posed for photographers, Lomatchenko’s manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between men would be “perfect in terms of size”.
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved the series up [63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small 63.5-pound.
I want back in the lights.
He's got to get up in the lights [61.2 kg], then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let’s fulfill their wishes.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"Fighting needs this game."
Klimas asked whether the match should be held on the payout channel. This is part of his strategy for Lomatchenko, according to which Lomatchenko will debut in the light series later this year and fight against Garcia next summer (37–0, 30 knockout wins). Garcia would also be interested in meeting the winner of the light match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell in September. Linares and Campbell in the 23rd
"The match could be on the payout channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
“We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomchenko as an "incredible fighter" and that he might be going to watch Saturday's match.
Lomatchenko interrupted Garcia's praise and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he focused first on showing the impact force and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that they wanted the match between them to be even stronger.
“This is the game we are waiting for.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
"I'm definitely involved in this," Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said he was expecting to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match.”
Average salary 5,300 euros, education what happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been talked about a lot lately.
The last time Helsingin Sanomat told about Ritva, 68, to whom the investment adviser of the brokerage firm spoke a complete nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new MiFID, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify any skills requirements.
The financial industry (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of the examinations for APV-investment examinations Ltd., whose examination team includes experts from the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (FINA), universities and industry.
The scope of the degrees is 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Ltd., which provides management development services.
Its website states that, in general, both exams are "very extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material for the degrees includes 10-15 books as well as numerous other guides and works.
According to Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Examinations Ltd, the pass rate of the exams is roughly 70 per cent.
Of the staff of the largest banks, approximately all providers of investment services have completed either the APV1 or APV2 examinations, as these are mandatory according to the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller banker shops without mentioning names, whose staff seems to have avoided completing the examinations, Savikko says.
According to him, there are “some” such bankers.
According to Savikko, between 13,000 and 14,000 people have completed the APV1 exam since 2000 and about 3,000 people have completed the more demanding APV2 exams recommended for investment advisors.
Some brokerage firms consider completing a degree to be an advantage.
Many other industries have significantly stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the Financial Industry requires the completion of APV examinations, because that is when the competence related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros per month on average, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance bonuses.
The average earnings of monthly wage earners for regular working hours is approximately EUR 5,300.
On average, men working in positions earn more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,900 per month and women more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,500 per month.
On average, the top ten earners earn about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,100.
The tenth of men earning the most earners earns more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9,000 per month or more, while one-tenth of women earning the most earners earn <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,400 or more.
Only a licensed company can provide investment advice in accordance with the Investment Services Act.
At the employee and task level, self-regulation has so far been trusted.
According to Fiva, the audit found individual cases where the professional skills and competence of the investment advisor were insufficient based on the activities of the advisor.
In principle, you can also act as a seller of investment products, even if your skills and qualifications are at a low level.
In this respect, the situation has been wild and free.
Many other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements, says Savikko.
According to Savikko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened by the new MiFID II.
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently skilled.
In turn, the Financial Supervisory Authority will have the power to determine what needs to be done.
Marko Hovi, Fiva’s market supervisor, says that one of the clear changes to the current regulation is a regulation on the skills and experience requirements of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to Hovi, the new requirements apply both to the investment firms’ own staff and to tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
Hovi says that according to a government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will probably have the power to determine competence and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All of this needs to be documented, and the company has an obligation to prove that this has been done.
Hovi specifies that in practice, the company must, for example, map the personnel’s job descriptions at the individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of requirements, depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to Hovi, it is also a requirement to work with someone who is more experienced within the time limit if the level of knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
That is, if a company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, with the change, the rules will be tightened and concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
The 787 Dreamliner "drawn" a giant plane over the United States.
The route flown by the plane was drawn over the United States on Flightradar24 service.
The flight was conducted on Thursday with the 787 Dreamliner, which was used by Boeing to test the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long-haul flight.
The flight from Seattle flew 15,700 kilometres in 18 hours and 1 minute, which is longer than any regular commercial flight in the world.
The flight remained within U.S. borders.
It flew through 17 states.
Iines Kaikkonen pushed hard with the help of the swimming village Iines Kaikkonen
Iines Kaikkonen made good progress, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools run in Liette and Lempukka this and next week.
Even though it sometimes rains and then it shines again, young swimmers are not in trouble, says Taina Itkonen, head of swimming schools.
In this week’s swimming schools, a total of 13 children are acquiring swimming skills, next week a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that the school and the essayist will begin then, Itkonen estimates.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised in cooperation by the Liikunta Connects project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, the beach in Liete had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and the young swimmers were training to stay on the surface with the swimmers, some of them even without.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
I was 5, and I thought I was going deeper into the water.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged him to pound towards the beach.
You're doing great!
He said he went swimming a lot this summer.
The beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You will also be happy with today’s achievements, the swimmer praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, once again wanted a water battle.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg’s swim from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good starting point for learning how to swim.
Even though the weather has been no matter what, Anna has loved to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimmers packed on the dock.
The boys had enough to do with the frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacked on fruit and baked for the day.
The teaching continued in the water, but there was no rush on the pier.
It’s like not being in the summer.
An Unknown Soldier Sells Toilet Brushes - "Here's a Unifying Story"
You see all sorts of things.
A few days ago, Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product line.
I mean, dish toothbrushes and laundry racks and a "toilet brush with a rim brush."
The Unknown Soldier refers to the film and the marketing of the film, which will premiere this autumn.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been grinned at on social media: When will the Unknown sanitary napkins come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Deputy CEO of Siniteuto, say?
We are the film’s partner.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support Finnish production and cult film,” says Määttä.
According to him, the products will be put on special display in stores, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often when you think that the products and the stories attached to them have something in common?
Yes, this is such a unifying story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products,” says Määttä.
According to him, the company supports his basic Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown soldier.
Cleaning is also not foreign to military culture, Määttä points out.
Other partners in the film are Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, Hartwall’s vichys have been introduced, for example, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products have already been scrapped by blogger Kalle Kinnunen from Suomen Kuvalehti
Coffee and clocks are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still time for a follow-up.
Unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, such as Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, writes Kinnunen.
New results of age tests for Swedish asylum seekers published
The latest results of medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published. The results of tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years of age. However, not everyone considers the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Agency started testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants claiming to be minors.
So far, the Finnish Immigration Service has commissioned 6,880 tests, and the Forensic Service has now published the results of 2,481 tests, which were conducted between mid-March and end-July 2017.
In addition, in 25 cases, the forensic services determined that the test subjects were "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker was "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests were only carried out in cases where there were doubts as to the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the forensic medicine agency says that the results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent, and there are no major differences from the previous months' statistics," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, there were “indications that the subject was 18 years of age or older.”
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would turn 18 this year.
In the medical age assessment method used in the tests, X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints are taken. Then the images are analyzed by dentists and radiologists. The method has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet whose work includes an assessment of the biological maturity of humans. The evaluation can be used to determine whether a person has entered puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t determine age with certainty, we shouldn’t pretend we can do it,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, the forensic agency Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test subject will soon be 18 years of age, and the risk is about 10 percent."
Ilonen crashed 30 places in Scotland
Five over par in the third round Mikko Ilonen spent 30 points on the scoreboard downwards in the competition of the European golf tour in Scotland.
Ilonen left from 11th place to Saturday, but we found 41th place at the end of the round.
In the difficult weather, Ilone accumulated one double bog with three bogs.
Others were difficult too.
Englishman Ian Poulter stood up to share the top spot in the one under par round, even though he told me that there was enough work to hold the umbrella.
The weather was raw, but I was hanging along and the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the lead with his compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia Governor to Change Party
West Virginia's Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a Trump campaign event that he would change parties.
"The Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
“Today I can tell you, after many prayers and careful consideration...Today I tell the people of West Virginia that I can no longer help you as the governor of the Democrats.”
The audience cheered with applause.
"Tomorrow I registered as a member of the Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, according to Forbes, the only billionaire in the state.
He inherited from his father a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth about <0x24>1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night that “Governor Justice’s party change is yet another blow to a democratic party that builds barriers rather than a better America.”
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before, and in this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership at all and cannot find a positive message that unites people," RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.
Lightning has sown damage - Thursday is becoming even the hardest day of summer thunderstorms
There will also be more thunderstorms in southern Finland by the end of the week.
During the past week there has been thunderstorms, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes set off several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday could be the most thunderous day of the summer so far.
The thunderstorms have finally found Finland as well.
Over the past week, there have been lightning strikes, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
At the table, the lightning struck the power plant of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue service received a fire report about 15 minutes past midnight on Wednesday.
The electric centre was located in the sauna area at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue service dismantled the roof and wall to find fires and quickly extinguished the fire.
Eleven apartments were without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
At Lomaa, the lightning set the outbuilding on fire in Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue service arrived, the building was already in full fire phase, and the rescue service could only prevent the fire from spreading.
A 50-square-foot outbuilding burned to the ground.
In Rääkkylä, in the direction of Kuopio, lightning struck a detached house again.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flash of lightning.
The rescue service visited the scene to check the incident, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses burned.
In traffic, thunderstorms caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, as the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The report was received on Thursday morning between 8 and 9 a.m., after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was not resolved until five o’clock in the afternoon.
Since then, rail traffic has also been able to continue normally on the thunder-stricken section of the railway.
Lightning has sown devastation throughout Finland.
Lightning, however, has been relatively low this summer.
This summer’s thunderstorms have been very sad! says Jari Tuovinen, an on-call meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have been mostly moderate in intensity, but due to the low lightning balance in the summer, it feels even strong to many.
This might seem like a really loud thunderstorm, but that's what it has been compared to this summer's thunderstorms, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, land flashes bounced 1,700 times, and Thursday has had potential for even the toughest day of the summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 land flashes in the poster.
If the lightning continues at the beginning of the evening, then we can get over two thousand lightnings, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-breaking thunderstorm year was in 2015, when the number of lightnings per year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year’s number had risen to 18,386.
So there is still something to catch up on so that this year does not break the "record" two years ago.
However, the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass above Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a favourable birth environment for thunderstorms.
The focus of the thunderstorms is likely to shift from the northernmost parts of the country to the south by Saturday, where approximately 2,000 lightning days can be obtained on both Saturday and Sunday.
The central parts of the country are expected to have a more uniform rainfront.
According to Tuovinen, there is only a few thunderstorms.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised Russia's "open-minded apology" for the doping scandal on Thursday, but added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban on participation.
Russia’s head of athletics, Dmitry Shlyahtin, told the IAAF Congress on Thursday that Russia’s ban was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted "all those athletes who were stripped of gold or silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the extension of the ban, and Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very direct and very open-minded," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation acknowledged that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do everything in its power to reorganize its activities."
Coe also said he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for lifting the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group's recommendation that now is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can to normalise the situation in the coming months.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday and have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet a number of requirements before it can be restored.
"The testing is still insufficient and the coaches who have been banned continue to operate freely," he told reporters on Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company was disappointed with the poor success of the Tom of Finland film
The film Tom of Finland did not become as successful as the authors hoped, Yle says.
To be honest, I am disappointed, admits Helsinki Film’s CEO Annika Sucksdorff in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100,000 viewers, which is little compared to the film’s budget of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million.
This is not a lottery win, but now it is important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful at home, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams from foreign distributions, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How football’s financial rules affect Neymar’s transfer to Paris
The rules restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from transferring from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in France, the most expensive football transfer ever made.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, the governing body of European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the Financial Rules for Fair Play, which require PSG to demonstrate that Neymar’s transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million for the termination of the Brazilian contract, and Neymar’s annual salary in the new club is in the tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a number of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer and linking him to its Star Guards, as the club is funded by the Qatari oil-rich royal family.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money on acquiring players, but they need to be balanced by real sources of income so that the football business is not loss-making.
The financial rules for fair play were drawn up at the initiative of Michel Platini, who was elected UEFA President in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success through debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners pulled back.
In 2011, the financial rules of fair play shifted the focus from clubs’ debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 was significantly complicated. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year review period of the financial rules of fair play will last until 2018, during which clubs will be allowed to make a maximum of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million in losses.
Although Platini was forced to resign as UEFA president in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, also wants to curb the club’s reckless spending.
"The rules of fair play are still in place, and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the financial rules of fair play at UEFA, told Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of its contract on a lump sum basis, it may defer the amount to the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be booked as an annual expense of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
According to the financial rules of fair play, the first sanctions were imposed in 2014, with the biggest penalties being imposed on PSG and the Abu Dhabi-funded Manchester City.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million, which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and the club was ordered to limit its Champions League team to 21 players for the 2014–15 season, instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may attempt to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies affiliated with the club’s owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than normal market levels, UEFA does not count the aid as actual income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatari Tourism Authority’s support for PSG was overstated.
It has also emerged that part of Neymar’s profits from PSG could be financed by fees from Qatar’s 2022 World Cup Organising Committee.
However, the PSG and the Organising Committee have denied that Neymar is being made an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to expose such an arrangement.
Due to PSG’s previous sanctions, UEFA is monitoring companies more closely than usual to circumvent the rules.
Sources informed of the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG on Neymar’s transfer.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press on the condition that their identity would not be disclosed because they had no authority to discuss PSG’s situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015–2016 amounted to EUR 542.4 million and its operating profit to over EUR 10 million.
Last year’s financial statements have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and shirts.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 percent as a result of the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move, allegedly in violation of the financial rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic case of doping, both for the club and for the state," Spanish league president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the Qatari ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding of the football club, which is owned by an American sports giant.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the operating environment of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said.
“Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to follow the financial rules of fair play. There are so many different interests associated with the fact that a famous player represents the state."
Finland’s World Championships athletes’ coach is stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and three jumper Kristiina Mäkelä’s coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though she should be coaching at the World Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump qualifier tomorrow and Mäkelä in the triple jump qualifier on Saturday.
However, their coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not been granted a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter in the British embassy without success.
The coach has a documentary invitation from the organizers of the World Cup, but it is also not valid for obtaining a visa.
I wonder if this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, isn’t it, said coaching director Jorma Kemppainen.
He has always handled visa matters successfully himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He'll do whatever it takes to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As soon as someone in the stadium looks at the steps, Arttu Pajulahti said about his coach’s possible absence.
World Cup medal for Finland from London requires a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics will start in London on Friday and run for a week and will end on Sunday, August 13.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports that Finnish bench athletes are passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one title to another, where by gaining experience, the athlete’s performance is matured to the level that an adult World Championship medal is truly possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland’s small World Cup team, and certainly no such athletes.
The World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Luckily, the attractiveness and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench athletes to the TV screen and glues them to watch the races, even though the London medals will not be awarded until late in the evening due to the time difference.
From the previous World Championships in Athletics in 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by the spear-thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The bold medals are still waiting for Pitkämäki’s medal even now, although the results of his and other throwers of recent times and Pitkämäki’s qualifier in last summer’s honours show the other.
Whatever happens in these competitions, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, getting into the finals or setting their own record is a good enough achievement.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish athletics in the coming years will be a great success in the international athletics competitions for young people this summer as well.
The upgrading of young talents and financial support for their work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also know how to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully the London Games will be in the past as Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of fear of terrorism or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi finished second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
Copper Mountain’s second place is Rukajärvi’s best big air world cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
On his last jump, he tried the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the race, and it was very close to success.
I feel good and feel good now, but I'm sad that the last jump didn't go all the way.
I will try it again from now on, Rukajärvi.
In a snowboarding big air, a competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line's new express ship landed in Helsinki
Viking’s new express ship FSTR is significantly behind schedule.
The speedboat had to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship was loaded in eight countries.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting for him to get on the boat.
Now the car queue is moving a bit, the Estonian Johannes Rebane, who is waiting for boarding at the port of Helsinki, told us at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane said there was a technical problem with the new ship.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought bottles of water for those waiting in their cars to board the ship.
Viking’s Communications Manager Christa Grönlund told IS that there was a technical problem.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be late for the return trip to Tallinn for a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn and return to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.

Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story haunts both the characters' glorious days of the '80s and the grunge of the '90s (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant The State sketch series for MTV) and their own time – 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars in the series moved on to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant reminiscence we have been stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems outdated.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humour (this was reported as the background story of a vegetable can that speaks in the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
The point of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lusty teenagers approaching adulthood, emphasizing it makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, in which adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies stalker films from the 90s, such as the horror film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs up the Apple Powerbook, inline skates, and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer, but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Ronald Reagan (also known as Michael Showalter) is the accomplice of George H. W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in this series, the best are the side paths.
It’s especially fun to see the age-old Paul Rudd, who has a shaved lip aka Matt Dillon’s “soul patch” from the film Singles. Rudd’s role as Andy, the camp king, is starting to be an old man.
The moments of random madness may bring this series to life as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends will go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: The Americans’ Cold War spirit, Atomic Blonde, and even the GLOW series’ nomadic resistance, where the East meets the West.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, the comedy series is a Romanian police drama of the 1980s in which a pair of Bucharest cops fight for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
Starring Gregor and Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, they dubbed in English Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But there is not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (policemen spend time watching chess on TV in the same way that Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective gets too caught imitating a clumsy socialist drama – including a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask, for example – which is why the series often begins to feel really clumsy as propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor in the series is not fast enough.
In summary, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby eating hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can make everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devour our recent history and theirs as well.
Kouvola-based Toni Tauru takes to the ring in Macau on Saturday - faces former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match going.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macau, as Brazilian Leandro Issa fought in the UFC last year.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of the jujutsu and the world championship of the sport.
For once, I'm fighting myself against a parent.
It’s a funny story, says the 32-year-old Tauru.
Kouvola was supposed to be in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fights were quickly scheduled for the Chinese self-governing region of Macau.
The Taurus has never encountered anything like this before.
This is the first time my game has been cancelled.
It was annoying, as preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new time has been set for the fight.
Waiting for a week has little to do with preparation.
The transplant will not affect your condition, as it will not improve in a week.
Your condition can get worse if you exercise too much.
In a few previous battles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths lie in standing up.
This time the situation is different.
Issa Kouvola describes her as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he comes in the first round hard and tries to take me to the carpet.
He's won the Jujutsu World Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
Kouvola’s last match didn’t go as planned.
Kevin Belingon, a Filipino, hit Tauru badly in the eye, leaving the Philippines victorious.
I’ve never fought so well, especially when I was standing up: he didn’t get a single hit.
When I went down, he hit my eyebrow.
It's been annoying for a very long time.
A new motivation
Some fighters fight once a year, some rise to the ring more often.
For example, the prospective opponent Issa last fought in September.
Taurus, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
This is the second battle of the year.
Sometimes the pace gets pregnant.
In the last few years I have been training and in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for the sake of fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a while.
I was training in Espoo and got the joy of doing it back.
We had a really good training with a friend from Sweden.
The training was a great help, as on Saturday the Kouvolaan will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have had the opportunity to train against opponents of the same size and to practice upright.
Standing up is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You gotta be smart.
If I get a chance, I'll take it to the plot myself.
Downstream exports should not be given for free, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts the Taurus, which had previously been fought in China.
They say it's Las Vegas, China.
I think we're gonna have a big, great night ahead of us.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been inefficient and inflation abatement has put an end to speculation about interest rate increases.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and the Bank has postponed interest rate increases due to increasing pressure on the income levels of families.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee decided by a vote of 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank lowered its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 per cent and for 2018 to 1.6 per cent, and warned that household income levels will be under increasing pressure as inflation is expected to continue to pick up to close to 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, according to the bank, interest rate increases will be needed in the next few years to curb the inflation boosted by Brexit, and the bank also announced that loan costs may need to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, members of the committee decided to cancel part of the massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago after the Brexit referendum.
The bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 million more affordable financing to banks through the scheme, i.e. a total of <0xC2><0xA3>115 million.
The Bank's interest rate protocol states: "According to the forecast of the Monetary Policy Committee, the slow development of gross domestic product will continue in the coming years as the decline in real household income reduces consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for "some tightening of monetary policy" on a "slightly broader scale" than market expectations in order to curb inflation.
The market is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and a second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the bank forecasted an increase of 1.9% for this year and 1.7% for next year.
Now it kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound declined by 0.5% to <0x24>1.31, while the euro declined by 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after weaker than expected growth rates dampened the increased expectations of interest rate increases. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope for households suffering from accelerating inflation and low wage increases, and the Bank said the situation would deteriorate before it got any better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot" prevent a decline in revenues in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to "significantly" recover at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will offset part of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the interest rate was reduced to 0.25% following the shocked outcome of the EU referendum, which plunged the pound into decline.
The bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the central bank’s latest decision, demand for interest rate increases had become louder and louder as inflation increased the pressure on households.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but according to the Bank, it was expected, and inflation will pick up again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, its excess over the 2% target was "totally" due to the weak pound.
"Given the recent drop in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be getting even more intense as lenders are feverishly seeking customers and want to end the year strongly," said Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is about to expire. Revolving contracts are increasingly popular, with low interest rates and cost-free options available."
NHS orders 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
As of September, patients can be prescribed a "revolutionary" anti-HIV drug. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute over the financing of the drug by the English Public Health System (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to about 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Pre-sex medication has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by about 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court’s verdict last year, according to which the NHS will be able to pay for the PrEP drug, even though it claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS in England, called the decision announced on Thursday a “significant new intervention,” and the national AIDS organization described it as “a crucial moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to start accepting enrolments for the trial, which will expand to other clinics in October. The trial will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an anti-HIV medicine that is taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in at-risk groups.
The drug taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during sexual intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with an HIV-positive partner who does not receive effective treatment.
The clinics select eligible candidates for the trial from men, women and transgender people, as well as from those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral therapy for their disease.
People living in England and enrolled in a general practitioner can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and the NHS in England signed a procurement contract for medicines this week after an international tender.
The aim of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, intake and treatment delivery.
“This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the diverse and increasingly effective ways to prevent HIV,” says Stevens.
“It is yet another remarkable achievement in the battle for more than 30 years to solve one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, head of the National AIDS Organization.
“If PrEP medication is properly targeted to those in need and those at risk, it can have a pivotal effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk will receive a drug through an NHS-funded trial that they can use independently, without having to negotiate with a partner. It will have an empowering effect that will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
This was welcome news."
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and that no one at risk is excluded," said Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect 10,000 people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that was unnecessarily prolonged for several months because of the government's slowdown," said Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government's health minister.
“We have evidence that the drug can have a transformative effect on the work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
What is important now is that the experiment be launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and get one more step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Quality of life: the middle floor and smart interior design solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Ex-banker Joanne Leigh moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna’s era-style house. The success of the renovation is shown by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her gear and moved.
"Before this, I lived with my ex in a much larger apartment in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to the apartment screen here and found that the rooms were as high as my apartment at the time.
I was delighted and made an offer the same day.”
Since then, the apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete deformation.
It was a two-room apartment, where you could only access the bedroom from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to make use of the room height.
“I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
“That was my demand,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from Duck & Shed, a design agency in Notting Hill, to use the space of almost four meters high rooms to create an apartment that would not only be for renovation and sale, but also for home.
The room height was not quite sufficient for the two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where you could stand.
The solution required Erfan to think creatively.
“Steel structures are quite complex.
The rooms had to be arranged so that there was no need to crouch.
The structures had to be adjusted so that the height was just right above and below them.”
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms with fascinating details on top of each other.
On the middle floor, Retrouvius’s copper-crossed window opens to an elegant lounge.
Mirrored furniture, silver accents and vintage lamps by Serge Mouille create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
Mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than it really is.
A mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window with a view to another room.
The mirrored furniture in the entrance has storage space for Joanne’s cutlery and glassware.
What adds to the style is that the kitchen can be hidden when not in use.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But the unique thing about Joanne’s kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a little planning," Erfan says about the steel-reinforced MDF veneered door.
"It is balanced, meaning it slides very easily when lifted into place."
With the rational use of space and storage design, Joanne got 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and an even better floor plan.
"When selling an apartment, the area determines – or the valuation of the property," Erfan says.
"In the base case, the realtor walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The resident is in contact with the materials in the apartment, and the emotional connection to the apartment is partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one attaches to the electrical wires in the walls.
They are important too, but not in the same way.”
Joanne’s apartment is an example of how good planning and additional squares can make a basic apartment exceptionally exquisite.
It may also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiated in her summer look
Princess Sofia's outfit hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented B<0xC3><0xA5>stad, Sweden for the last time before giving birth.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a delicate light blue dress.
Sofia was smiling at the event.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited B<0xC3><0xA5>stad, Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a gorgeous blue, body-containing outfit that was beautifully dressed for a pregnant princess.
Sofia came to the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last event where Sofia will be represented before her birth.
His due date is September.
For the dinner of the event Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed beautifully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue suited the princess well.
Sofia has been on a mission in B<0xC3><0xA5>stad, Sweden this week.
Sofia complemented her outfit with a small bag.
Sofia radiated in her fresh summer look.
At the event, Sofia even got excited to talk to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said, laughing and referring to her final pregnancy.
She's raising us with sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a booth appeared on the market in Lahti, where Thai food was sold.
The Lahti people did not dare to taste, but walked by.
At the house Panya Suamsri-Penttilä sold food, among the acquaintances Panja.
He didn't know much Finnish, and the Finns didn't know Thai at the time.
Since the people did not dare to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Lahti people to eat Thai food, spring rolls at a time.
Try it, he said.
I got hooked on the bay.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai canteen in Lahti Market Hall.
It had two small tables, I think there were less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and there are limited spaces, you cannot leave an empty chair between you and a guest.
Little by little we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat down at the plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years passed on the side of the market hall, but then the restaurant had to change because the spice pastes they made themselves were supposed to smell too much in the hall.
A new place was vacated at the end of the market hall.
There's room.
Now we yurters get to sit at our own tables again, only in the most busy times we shyly have to ask the guests if there is room next to us.
The bank knows its customers.
They tell him where they've been and who they've seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
She has seen how the life stages of her customers vary and the food company changes.
She remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring rolls with.
She remembers me skinny and fat, and remembers how I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my own place next to the kitchen door and exchange things with Panja, who is leaning to the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
She has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
He has opened not only our sense of taste, but also our thoughts and hearts.
Nowadays, many people speak Thai to him - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always kind.
He's a hard worker.
After dinner at the restaurant, he goes for mushrooms and blueberries.
Last week, the restaurant was quietly celebrating the completion of two decades.
We got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without any fuss or attention, this important day went by, at work.
Discovery of an underground base reveals 173 ISIS terrorists ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, security officials received a list of important anti-terrorism activities.
The list includes data from more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document contains not only their personal data but also pictures of each person.
More than 130 of the people on the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazjikistan and Saudi Arabia.
He told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have been refined.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi military special forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and photos while investigating a terrorist group's underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence agencies assessed the authenticity of the documents and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after the defeat of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of each person, but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person’s home country.
The list also details the specialties of terrorists.
For example, the 27-year-old German Sami J. on the list is called Abu Assid al-Almani, or German.
He is said to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then through Libya, and later through Turkey to Syria to join the ranks of ISIS.
A suicide bomber is written next to his picture.
The man’s fate is not known.
A total of about 6,000 fighters from Europe have left the ranks of ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
Man sank under the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
Based on the interviews with the rescue department, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
A person drowned in Tokoinranta, Helsinki, was rescued on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, fire chief on duty at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A rescue diver found him beneath the surface, Estlander said.
The rescue service received a notification at 3:30 p.m.
The person was handed over to emergency care.
Estlander said it was a 50-year-old man.
According to the interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is over.
Estoniaer commends the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
The guides were also very helpful to the divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars collided in Eura, nine people, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries, the on-call fire chief said.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads at four o'clock in the day.
The accident occurred when one car turned behind the warning triangle in front of the other car, says the on-call fireman.
According to the Rescue Board, there is a speed limit of 80 km/h in the intersection area.
Brothers fight over <0x24>500 million in real estate
Two brothers are fighting over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over <0x24>500 million, in connection with a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toorak Territory just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has sued the Supreme Court for a dispute over the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the divorce.
Together, the brothers and their mother, Anna, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate property when they bought a deal on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The chain sold for <0x24>85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to a contract with the deceased father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets.
According to court documents, the property split means that Colin owns property worth about <0x24>316 million and Paul owns property worth about <0x24>176 million.
Paul isn't happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin in his proposal left the best properties for himself," Paul wrote in his first sworn statement to the court in 2015.
The case was dealt with last Friday in the Supreme Court for the first time after several attempts at conciliation.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says it's not true, and he's accusing Paul of mismanagement of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first sworn testimonies that he would like to find a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing for me," Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as some of the country’s best and most experienced lawyers, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and grocery stores in the late 1950s, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought the property in Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first denim store.
Colin said he founded the store “in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the property to their sons peacefully.
"Luigi often said he didn't want the brothers to end up in court," Anna wrote in a statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis group business. Colin says Mark received <0x24>10 million and Luke <0x24>26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are “broken by the economic conditions of their departure.”
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former board member of the Australian Football League and the best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this biography published in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin was the only one who answered, and he said in a text message that he couldn't really comment on it because it was going to be tried in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family into a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue this way," Colin said, adding that he still hoped that a solution would be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to be gone.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff will restrict the president’s use of media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally do it.
The first.
According to Poltico magazine, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit President Trump’s use of media and news monitoring so that the boss doesn’t get into trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reported:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with executives on his first day of work, he raised a central problem he is going to solve: he is going to restrict President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House employees that all information, whether printed or heard at press conferences, must pass through her, because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.”
Kelly’s words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump’s media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television – and as president he still watches a lot of television.
"If Presidential candidate Trump was nervous about the unfair news, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media handled the issues more equitably," Trump campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico journalist Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “six former campaign workers say that managing Trump’s use of Twitter is essential for his personal media flow to include a steady stream of praise.”
Yeah, okay.
But it’s ridiculous to say that Trump’s use of Twitter was ever in control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don’t – maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even more savage without their efforts.
We’ll probably never know what kind of messages Trump left unanswered.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing trouble even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a riot.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are rival factions in the White House trying to push for their cause by giving Trump information that supports their view. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisers deliberately provided the president with questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher reported on a case:
“Trump’s current and former employees say that he can be furious about newspaper clippings that criticize him – especially if they’re about harmful data leaks – and then he’s absolutely bound to know where the information came from.
That was the case at the end of February, when someone gave the president a mischievous copy of a news article on the GotNews.com website, founded by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Katie Walsh of several White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and later withdrew them, and he also failed to provide concrete evidence.
"Nevertheless, Trump had started asking about Walsh after reading the case."
Goldmacher added that then chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House chief of staff Rob Porter “had attempted to implement a document management system for Trump.”
And what was the result?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pushing their own agendas.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, according to AFP.
Earlier Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a buy-out price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to FC Barcelona.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona was therefore terminated and he was free to move to the Paris club PSG.
The transfer amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million is the largest in football history.
The record was set by Manchester United last summer for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million for Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a Qatari state-owned company.
The club is chaired by former tennis pro Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Successful author Raija Oranen overcame alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I'm in the shape of my life"
From the TV series The Time of the Rose and Pure White Linens, the well-known bestselling author Raija Oranen just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
In addition to writing, five grandchildren hold the grandmother so in their grip that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola’s apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring they also rented a flat.
In the light and in the sun, out of the old circles, Raijan was once taken away by the depression and alcoholism that he has survived.
The exterior is 20 pounds lighter.
Weight began to fall when serotonin drugs were stopped, they were antidepressants.
I was helped with alcoholism by hypnosis, which also helped with fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years.
"Alcohol takes a person," says the radiant writer openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have travelled the same route for more than 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism industry, have been travelling together for over 40 years.
I asked her to marry me in two weeks, she laughed.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been, ending her life with that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has made an extensive career as a writer, only remembers the 44-part series Pure White Linens, which touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to work in the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä’s 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a sewer myself, my mother also had a clothing store and I sometimes acted as a mannequin, Oranen recalls.
The plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen’s research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives an active time as a writer, she has many manuscripts in the works - hundreds of ideas.
They returned across the ditch to the "millionaires' alley"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again on a hair-swept boat with stubborn rovers who managed to cross the ditch that the municipality needed and return to the field next to the houses.
Circularists parked about 20 of their caravans near a street called the Millionaires' Alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat that the municipality needed as a barrier, bringing with them children, horses, and an army of vans.
The circlers managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Angry residents have accused Solihull’s municipality of “complete inability to solve the problem.”
An unnamed resident reports that tourists arrived Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones at passers-by.
“You have to force the municipality to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tourers were here in May, then they left but came back.
There were more of them tonight and probably more of them today.”
The resident said the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the travelers returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before, and they have even landed in a park grazing a horse."
According to a spokesperson for Solihull Municipality, the municipality is aware of an illegal camping operation near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal steps with the Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
In order to collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report disruptive or criminal activities to the police.
It will help to form an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Angry people surround Portugal's plane
In Portugal, men who made an emergency landing on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
As a result of the forced landing, two people died yesterday.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with murder.
In Portugal, the maximum sentence could be 16 years in prison.
Yesterday, a small plane flew by men was forced to make an emergency landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, due to a technical problem.
At the time of the incident, hundreds of people were on the beach, some of whom ran into the water to escape from the landing plane.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl, who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man in the back of the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane went up, and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, said Filipe Janeira, who was on the beach, to the Jornal de Noticias newspaper.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents were not hurt.
The passengers on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl’s father and other people went to the plane and began to beat the back of it, according to Celia Rocha, a witness to the incident, in the newspaper Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a miracle that no more people have died.
The two men on board were not injured in the crash.
A Finnish star who tragically lost his leg once again won the World Cup gold medal: "Without the accident, I wouldn't be a world champion"
On early Wednesday morning, Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated the World Championships in banked slalom at the Big White in Canada.
Suur-Hamari also won the Cross World Cup gold medal.
All in all, three World Cup titles have already been accumulated.
What an incredible World Cup!
Twice the gold was taken care of, with quite a good heartbeat, Suur-Hamari, who was reached by phone, rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamari, the number of challengers in the species is constantly increasing.
The whole paralumni boarding has grown and evolved a lot lately.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new calculators.
I’m always wondering if there’s a black horse behind me.
There seems to be a different winner in each race.
Hamari lost one leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been skiing with his friends since he was young, and the accident did not take him to the slopes.
Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like without it.
But my attitude has always been that there is no point in jossitating.
The cards that are dealt are played, Suur-Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and the loss of a limb a lucky kick, and Hamari the Great does not.
But he took advantage of the terrible difficulty.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned to victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Suur-Hamari’s greatest passion for boarding was already fading.
My work towards the top really started only after the accident.
I trained with my friends when I was young, and we were always excited about the X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that faded somewhat over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow at the X-Games launch.
I could not have imagined in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sad.
I decided to put on my overalls and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The calculator was delighted with the selection of Leo-Pekka Star as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion won his prize at the Sports Gala in January.
According to Hamar, the victory of the Star is an important signal to the parasports.
It was a big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will certainly also open eyes to the parasports world.
When is it time to launch the double world champion Matti Suur-Hamari’s Athlete of the Year campaign?
We'll see in due course.
I try my best to succeed.
Yet Hamar has not conquered all the peaks he desired.
Next year we have a big goal.
In a year, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
We’re going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youth do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youth do not believe in a permanent return to their homeland.
“The end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS from the country are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The communications agency Burson-Marsteller investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
Burson-Marsteller has been researching the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian adolescents aged 18-24 responded to the survey, half of whom are women and half are men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the survey, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
42 per cent of the respondents could think of returning to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the young people’s decision to return home is mainly influenced by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIL in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in a permanent return, while a quarter think that the most important thing would be for ISIS to leave the country.
Fewer than one-tenth of Syria’s population points to an improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as key factors in the decision.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict.
Young Syrians were asked what was the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
More than a quarter of Assad’s presidency is seen as a barrier to a peace treaty.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
Only a quarter believe in resolving the conflict through military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth sees the power of ISIS weakened in the past year, while one-fifth sees its power strengthened.
Respondents say the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is that the media should inform people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Nearly as many people gave priority to military measures and education reform.
A fair tenth thinks that the most important thing is to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration’s impact on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe the conflict in Syria will worsen during Trump’s term.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or aggravated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the web in order - he developed a database that uses wikipedia and google, for example.
The Finnish company MariaDB is developing the “world’s fastest growing” open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs absolutely nothing to users and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge amounts of data are kept organized and quickly available.
For example, if you use LinkedIn, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the database of MariaDB or MySQL.
"All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are linked to it," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the CTO of MariaDB, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works remotely from beautiful places makes sure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed MySQL, the world’s most popular open source database, together with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, Sun bought MySQL for <0x24>1 billion, and a year later, Oracle devoured Sun for <0x24>7.4 billion.
When the Oracle transaction took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced that they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, which didn't give a firm promise of the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already started a company at this stage, which started to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired about 20 of the best developers from Sun to make sure that the code was maintained with the help of the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change my name.
A foundation was established to monitor the development of MariaDB code.
"During MySQL, these verifications were not done," Widenius regrets.
While many people have heard about Widenius and MySQL’s billion trading, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"Over the past few years, our growth rate has been around 50% a year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is short on the company’s key figures.
He reveals that in the current financial year MariaDB expects to receive orders worth EUR 20 million.
Because the database is free, the company has developed around it services that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps with the exchange of databases, which can be more than a year’s work if the customer has used a closed database.
You can switch from MySQL to MariaDB in no time because they are versions of each other.
The Spanish operator Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica and DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, are among MariaDB’s paying customers.
Most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating system distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest gamblers.
"Our customers include some of the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqvalén said.
Database markets are still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Even for Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, according to research firm Gartner, in terms of turnover, gamblers like MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast-growing.
In a <0x24>50 billion database market, open source databases don’t even reach <0x24>1 billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured only in terms of money, as most users do not pay for any of these software.
Researcher Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will develop more than 70 percent of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, at that time more than half of the old databases would have been switched to open ones or at least the transition would have started.
Big companies don’t get new customers because most choose open source next.
This has led to the fact that licensing fees for commercial databases have jumped into the cloud.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers," Widenius says.
Due to the difficulty of exchanging a closed database, the majority of customer companies have been obedient to the price increases.
"There are a lot of customers who find it really difficult to switch to because their old apps and others are stuck in a closed database," Widenius says.
But he still believes that the size of the customers is coming to an end.
As license fees increase every year, the customer will sooner or later switch to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent from the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Besides, many companies are facing major system changes as they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever provided by the EIB in the Nordic countries.
The company has approximately 115 employees worldwide and plans to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB financing was the impact of MariaDB on public ICT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe spends billions of euros annually on databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is annoyed that in Finland money is wasted on closed healthcare systems, for example, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say open source is an ideology, but I think it’s a better way to make code.
The community helps and does what it cannot or cannot do.
Widenius, 55, is one of the most well-known open source developers along with Linus Torvalds, another Finnish developer of Linux.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this subject.
Italy tightens its stance on NGO rescue boats
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that are rescuing refugees on their boats in the Mediterranean that they should not continue their activities unless they commit to complying with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new Code of Conduct, it will be difficult to see how they can continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnit's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated the German aid organisation Jugend Rettet, whose crew is suspected of cooperating with human smugglers, which promoted illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has been operating for only one year, refused to comment on the detailed charges brought against prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, and we deeply regret that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement posted on social media.
“We will only be able to assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa ship since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken on board boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who regained access to the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a few kilometres off the Libyan coast, according to a document from the prosecutor, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area, with the motive being the zeal to help.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS, and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
On Thursday, he said the new rules were “unnecessary” but “acceptable” because they would not create “significant changes or obstacles” to the organisation’s rescue operations.
Among those who refused to comply is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, for his part, said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy in the wake of rescue operations has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he sees as evidence that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are starting to bear fruit.
"In recent days, light has started to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans to continue discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development projects and on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe with Chad, Niger and Mali.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing his unmarried partner in Enontekiö, suspect found in terrain - case to prosecutor
The alleged crime took place in Enontekiö last December.
A 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
It was previously reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police also said the suspect had fled with two dogs after the attack.
The man was found cold in the terrain, and he did not resist when he was captured.
The case has to be filed in less than a week.
The case may be brought before the Lapland District Court in August.
Robert Hardy of Harry Potter and My All-Hairy Friends has died.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor’s death was announced by his family on Thursday.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also appeared in films and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for his role as Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and for his role as a veterinarian in the television series My All-Hairy Friends, based on the book by James Herriot.
The BBC’s popular series was filmed for seven seasons.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Prison for Inciting Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for texting and phone calls that allegedly prompted her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at a hearing on Thursday.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed against the judgment and was allowed to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, but his lawyers said both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, listened to his sentence with his hands crossed, with a weeping gaze on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to heal his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act,” the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
Carter’s lawyer said the incident was “caused by shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said Carter’s “age, maturity, and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions.”
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad’s mother, Lynn Roy, in which she said: “It will not be a day before I mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm going to cope with all this, and I'll do my best to comfort his sisters in the pain we'll always be in."
Conrad’s sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court that she was “persecuted” by the idea that she would never see her brother’s wedding or be an aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain will never go away," Camdyn said.
This seems to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to commit suicide is a criminal offence.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in his car in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it was revealed that Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Get yourself up, jump from the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy in the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the generator, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
Very few people have defended Carter, including Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox’s opinion paper, in which he states: “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.”
NATO Secretary General: Russia's worst relations since the Cold War
The relationship between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
“I think you can say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg told CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
However, Stoltenberg said NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid escalation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s remarks, US President Donald Trump said the relationship between the US and Russia had reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump called for thanks to the poorly-agreed Congress that approved new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi is changing 850,000 diesel engines due to a setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi’s announcement, BMW offered to update the software for more than 350,000 cars.
According to the BMW CEO, the company believes that “there are more sensible options than driving restrictions”, he referred to European cities, including BMW’s hometown of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies said anything about a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to meet their CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emissions neutralising devices will increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of sympathizing with the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies try to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes. Volkswagen installed scam devices in the cars, which reduced the emissions to comply with the regulations in the tests. In normal driving, the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of Audi’s engine development department, who was responsible for thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian citizen and can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent European emissions regulations. The accusation was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi’s investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen’s position: the luxury car manufacturer’s share of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionate.
Venezuela Vote Starts Fake Investigation, Major Protests Promise
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million more than the number of actual voters.
"This is an unprecedented opinion of a company that has no role to play in the election result," Tibisay Lucenan, chairman of the National Electoral Commission, told reporters.
Maduro says crisis will end
Venezuela voted on Sunday to elect a representative body to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its change.
The opposition to Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be on-going at the time of the appointment.
According to the newspaper El Pais, the country’s national security forces began taking over the country’s parliament building on Wednesday evening at local time.
The task force is to ensure the security of the nomination.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender had been reduced due to drought and disease-carrying insects. Scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is in direct danger in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a marked decrease in rainfall in the spring and especially in the autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence.
"This shortens the life of the lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small clusters into the area that are spreading microbial bacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long grains and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer essential oil-containing parts."
The solution is sought by intensifying irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture, spraying plants with a protective clay-water mix and developing drought-resistant varieties.
Reporter's Murder Reveals Growing Threat in Mexico
The editorial of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the newspaper deals with the latest cases of organized crime, corrupt authorities, and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists are asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which is safer: to leave the children at home or take them with them to a delivery that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the chalkboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. No evidence is needed, observations and feelings are enough.
They write the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or drug cartels, criminals who make the chaos in Mexico life-threatening for the news.
According to the Journalist Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto took office in December 2012, with 589 journalists under federal protection, and at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, editor and source of inspiration for Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is greatly missed, even though he is everywhere present. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge image with Valdez showing the middle finger. The photo reads: "Justice". Thirty-something journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts adorned with Valdez's smiling faces. Valdez has glasses and a branded panhat
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez’s death, and journalists will discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and fears that have escalated into paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor’s office was created specifically to deal with journalists’ cases, but according to the Journalist Protection Committee, so far only two charges have been filed.
Journalist murderers are rarely brought to justice, as are thousands of homicides per year linked to drug trafficking and organised crime.
Riodoce reporters plan to continue to write about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are overwhelmed by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security conference is of little use because the killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone until we know the cause of the incident."
Valdez had left Riodoce’s office in Culiacan on May 15, 2017.
He had only driven a couple of blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots, presumably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means the twelfth river.
The shooter drove off with Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was saddened by his wife and two grown children.
Rumors are moving fast and floating freely in Culiacan.
But Valdez's death is still a matter of silence.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
In the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has two-storey burial buildings decorated by drug lords, larger than many homes.
It is “peaceful” in a coastal state when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
While Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty about not being able to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival group that is waging war against Guzman's sons.
Guzman’s boys may have been annoyed by the case: suspected gang members bought every issue of the magazine as soon as it came to the outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so much that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroest when he decided in 2003, together with five colleagues, to set up Riodoce, the magazine's shares being sold for <0x24>50 at the time.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for news coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Prize of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade incessantly.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received the Journalist Protection Committee award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a “lifestyle,” Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“A journalist must take on the task that is his or hers – or play dumb.
I don’t want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was being sown here – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
The staff at Riodoce misses Valdez – a joker who cursed like a dockworker. They miss a friend who always gave them a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
He trusted in his routine.
He always wore a Panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar across the street and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were his fate.
The death of a colleague has also prompted them to think about how they can best do their job and stay alive.
“Criminals don’t like it when we talk about their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out of the cases,” Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection.
Confidence in your own instincts.
If you feel like everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce journalist Andres Villarreal, is that "impressions can be deceptive, and that is what happened in Javier's case".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
A few days earlier, it had become clear that spyware, sold only to governments, had been used to track activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had sought shelter in the shade of a tree from the 40-degree heat.
They had been ordered by the state government to guard Riodoce’s premises in a four-storey building in the middle-class area of Culiacan.
Some of the reporters half-jokingly questioned whether these two policemen were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's editorial had three main issues planned.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also revealed that the government’s spending was concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
In addition, in one of Culiacan’s most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor’s office, a group of people had been kidnapped.
There was no official information about who had been abducted and how, so we had to proceed cautiously: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they were getting reliable information about the kidnapping from the Valdez column.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body structure.
"Now all connections to our data sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been transformed into a warehouse, where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists are stored, and its employees have been given a new, unexpected task: to become activists for freedom of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him the next morning when she left for a demonstration outside the local prosecutor's office on the grounds of yet another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After his disappearance, a burnt body was found, which, according to the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Reporters have started protesting louder across the country, with "SOS Press" texts appearing on pavements and buildings in protests.
Today, Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is seeking international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, crime-permissive authorities, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces, in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articleulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murder has a debilitating effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
At his body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my writings."
Next to his cut-off head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close down, such as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua, following the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some will continue to operate as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message on the front page to the drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the country.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and we must be vigilant at all times.
Sometimes criminals look for a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to be a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking is frightening.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he said.
Some time ago, Riodoce journalists sat in front of the delivery on the sidewalk at midnight on Friday, when the latest issue of the magazine was finished.
19 people were killed in a shooting between rival gangs and security forces at Mazatlan beach resort.
The war intensified, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters put the news on Riodoce’s website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
I had to put the front page back the next day.
Sirens roar nearby – yet another shooting.
Bojorquez looked at the cops guarding the delivery:
If they were afraid, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's editorial continued the tradition of the magazine's murdered founder under this massive portrait, in which a man shows the middle finger to the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider shutting down. "How could I shut down the paper when our intern asked to go down the street to do a case the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Hard place"
In April, the celebrations of Hannu Manninen, who turned 39, were short as the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began catastrophically when Manninen became ill with the flu.
This was the beginning of a long period of illness that lasted almost five weeks.
In May, I was almost completely sick.
First there was the flu and finally there was a pediatric disease, such as ear infection, which I had to eat antibiotics for.
I was only able to do 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been so sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn’t take advantage of the training enthusiasm,” Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
Test result collapsed
The World Champion of 2007 did not receive a traineeship until the second week of June, which was shown in the KIHU’s roller mat test conducted on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis on a roller-skiing mat, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete’s fingertip with a needle.
Last autumn I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
It hit the wall, he said.
In a better direction
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says that he has remained healthy.
I have done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises that I have tried to normalize the body’s metabolism.
Now I have a really good five-week period.
It was also a one-and-a-half week vacation.
I also went to the cottage with my family.
Last season Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Championships.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening race, when Manninen climbed to the 18th place in the top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and the national team’s head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm of training compared to last season.
After the First Snow Games, Ruka will have a three-world cup weekend.
In December we plan to participate at least one World Cup weekend, maybe in Ramsau.
At the end of January, we plan to be in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be on the list of the Olympic team, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics will be Mannisen’s sixth Winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, with the moorland underline celebrating gold in the 2002 team race in Salt Lake City.
Dinosaur protects itself from its enemies by disguising itself
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now, researchers have revealed the first results of research on a creature the size of a rhino found by a Canadian miner that was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had been preserved so well that scientists could even determine that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and had had a "problematic past."
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the best of its kind in the world.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, the armored vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found in a Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn’t seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to explore his discovery further.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Palaeontological Museum in Tyrrell.
For six years, the beast was dug out of a 1,100-kilogram boulder.
The results of hard work can now be seen.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It falls into the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs.
Skin studies showed that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely to pose a significant threat to this vegetarian, although it had armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red and white armor disguises it against predators, and it was also protected from the top by a darker and lighter coloration, which is still found in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to blend with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaur made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have named it after Mark Mitchell, a Markmitchelli museum technician who was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shapes of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected by a common coloring in the animal world, where the body is darker on top and lighter underneath.
The sighting was still a surprise, because Borealope is considerably larger than the current animals with similar coloring.
It suggests that meat-eating dinosaurs preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding instead of fighting as a means of survival.
Among modern animals, deer, zebras and armadillos, for example, have a similar coloring, being considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that nodosaurians were also seriously threatened.
"The predation of a large, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaurs were," Brown says.
A chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the nodosaur scales reveals that its skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaur in order to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its intestine to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell into the river when it died and drifted into the sea, where it sank on its back on the seabed.
Alberta was then as warm as Florida today, and the rivers and seas probably stretched much further than they do today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because its scaly skin has survived and it has also survived in its original three-dimensional form," Brown said.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous
It takes little imagination to perceive it: if you squint a little, you can almost believe it was asleep.”
The Cretaceous era was the era of the theropods, huge two-legged meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopeltta, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
One of the predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex was the Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus scientists have been published in the journal Current Biology, who believe Borealope washed up in the sea after his death and mummified in the mud.
It was found in a Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, with its skins and armor from muzzle to hip.
The nodosaurs were, on average, five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two-half-metre spikes were raised from their pallets.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through present-day western Canada until a flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armor has survived down to the smallest details in an undersea tomb.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its skin remains in the hollow plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is “as rare as winning the lottery.
The more closely you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The hollow plates of its skull armor still contain fossilized leather.
Its right foreleg is on its side, with five toes up.
I can also count the scales of his foot."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York the day before from his home in St. Louis and was sitting on the bed in his airbnb apartment, browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his classmate:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from <0x40>TheePharoah.
The name belongs to a St. Louis-based rapper who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who had been shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown’s dead body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, it was reported that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police ribbons and screaming people, as well as a man claiming to be Brown’s father, carrying a sign that said, “Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!”
Ferrell watched a live video of police standing in front of demonstrators with a dog barking.
He also said he saw a video in which another policeman tuned his rifle and shouted, “I’ll kill all of you...the animals.”
"This is not normal," Ferrell recalls.
“It wasn’t the kind of murder we’re already used to and could be called typical.
Then I felt the cold.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at eleven in the evening, and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from her father's house, and decided that they would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years has been documented in the documentary Whose Streets?, which premiered in cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who went out into the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter dressed in a flower dress and a matching crown, they again had a conversation about "what it's like to be black and under what conditions." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers telling his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't help but take my daughter with me," Ferrell said later.
“The events of today are... the culmination of the events of the past.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow into it.
He must acquire the capacity for activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living as a black person, and he must know what we must do to liberate ourselves, to liberate ourselves.
Fortunately, I’ve been able to protect her from blatant racism, but she’s still the same as all the other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality.”
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists as they awaited information on the case and eventually learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was chairman of the Association of Minority Nurse Students. At that time, he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabah Folayan, the documentary’s assistant director, at an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar “wanted to simply tell you what was happening.”
Mr. Ferrell said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The suspicion was based on the countless times that people, usually white people, had appeared in the local community, who only wanted to benefit from its hardship and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice," Folayan said in an interview recently.
Folayan had already contacted Assistant Director Damon Davis, known for his activism with death row prisoners.
Davis's involvement led Ferrell to join the project, along with six other locals. The shooting team followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
“This isn’t a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, we speak for them,” Davis said.
“What really mattered to me was how the local people were portrayed in the movie, because I was portrayed in the same way.”
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because it was to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader, but about a community".
That’s why the documentary reveals surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
“I felt pretty naked,” Ferrell laughs as he tells me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
“But I understood that this work and the humane portrayal of blacks require a certain vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats and re-emphasizes the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (<0x23>BlackLivesMatter) after a black teenage boy, Trayvon Martin, was shot by police in 2012, and two of the three founders of the movement identify with the queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight on many fronts all the time.
Black queer women have had to endure everything.”
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, among whom there are many queer women."
However, he emphasizes that Ferrell was not selected for the documentary "self-intentionally" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"It's no coincidence, however, that she was in the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen.”
News crews have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the relationship between the community and the police remains tense.
Ferrell has two and a half years left on parole and was sentenced for blocking the highway during a demonstration.
His description of the social-political atmosphere in his hometown is brief and concise: "Crash mess."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he learned from the outside on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.”
Matching Similarity: Artist Creates Portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York City has hung in the center of the exhibition space faces —white, black, and brown faces that, when viewed in more detail, can be seen resembling each other.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning’s cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he served a 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg’s A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art. Manning is a transgender and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was relaxed by Barack Obama on the third day of his tenure.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning’s DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. These are a sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, statement on the adaptability of DNA data, ambiguity and the underlying cause-and-effect relationships and identity.
In 2013, Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, was found guilty of 20 crimes, including espionage, computer fraud, and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning, who was sentenced to prison: a granular, black and white selfie, in which the troubled-looking Manning sits in the driver’s seat in the car, wearing a platinum-white wig that became his hallmark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was behind the popular Stranger Visions project, which he implemented in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, obtained DNA data from cigarette butts and chewing gums, for example, and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture for their story," Dewey-Hagborg told the news conference of the new show.
Manning could not be visited and he could not be photographed in prison, so the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondence friends, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-authored the comic book Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which portrayed a future in which the president would have softened Chelsea's sentence and she would be able to watch the show.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence just a few days after the comic book was published, a lucky coincidence after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
It’s also impressive that the show opens right now, as Donald Trump is waging his own war against informants and transgender soldiers and is inventing more and more ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divisions he was actually supposed to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that “everything has a purpose.”
On the wall of the gallery is the artist’s statement and underneath it Manning’s large autograph, in which the point of the last name ‘i’ is the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to the “automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based”.
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of letters C, G and A written in a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotides, as the artist defines it – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in our genetic heritage and that the genetic data is very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA tells countless stories, 30 of which are on display here."
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page from Manning’s and Dewey-Hagborg’s comic book.
In it, Manning’s character rises from the prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can silence you, they've won," it says.
"Never be silent."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold vibrations."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the show. When Manning arrives, he is greeted with a face based on his own genetic data, like a crowd of demonstrators in the middle of the showroom.
It’s intentional, like everything else in this show: for example, Manning’s DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
“My face was on the wall before, but I wanted to make it feel like a crowd,” says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to film the mass movement that Chelsea created, which was also behind his release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
Police said they launched a nationwide search to find a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury home in Chicago.
According to documents from the Cook County Courthouse, on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local press release released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police at the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple cuts in her body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a murder and police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of Public Relations, said in an e-mail that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial aide at Oxford University.
A University and Somerville College spokesperson said in an email: “We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in all possible ways.”
In addition, the statement said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and hoped he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications at the Chicago Police Department, said he was urging the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly focusing our search," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and national authorities assist in the search for suspects.
He said police had received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as horrific.
According to Guglielmi, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza management team released the following statement to residents: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," he told police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and “kill all Muslims.”
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of harassment.
According to police, the bookstore staff alerted them on May 23.
He said he had threatened to blow up a bookstore and kill Muslims.
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about threatening him.
The threat was not related to the bookstore.
Authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore incidents, a police spokesman said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," Moffatt told police at the interrogation.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay <0xC2><0xA3>620 (approximately <0xC2><0xA3>690) for legal expenses and <0xC2><0xA3>85 (approximately <0xC2><0xA3>95) for compensation to victims.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said a number of hate crimes were not reported.
“We will complete the actions under the WADA roadmap in the near future” – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the activities under the World Anti-Doping Agency’s WADA roadmap, which will restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RUSADA).
"Part of the roadmap measures have already been taken, and RUSADA has been granted the right to design and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Commission UKAD.
WADA’s road map has been updated in these areas,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap, which sets out the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA’s mandate, and the second part was recently published on the organisation’s website.
It does not seem to have anything to worry about for Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be accomplished.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points in the roadmap requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly approve the results of a WADA-mandated investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who is investigating the alleged role of the state in Russian sports doping.
Mutko said: “The investigation is underway because our anti-doping system has admitted to failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we cannot admit what did not exist.”
Mutko’s words echoed the statement of Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of Russia’s independent public anti-doping committee.
Earlier that day, Smirnov, speaking to the Russian sports media RSport, admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping agencies. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
We will not accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015 after the extent of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UKAD.
In July, the head of WADA, Olivier Niggli, visited RUSADA's head office in Moscow and said that the organisation was "on the right track" to regain its powers.
British organisation skeptical of Finnish beloved innovation: 'no evidence' of health benefits of maternity packaging
A British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packaging.
According to the BBC and the Guardian, the Lullaby Trust, which fights SIDs, has banned the use of its own brochures on maternity packages distributed in the UK.
The distribution of maternity packages for all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity kit reduces the risk of SID death.
Sudden death is the unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust is the UK’s expert on child’s safe sleep.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them, as that would imply that we would recommend this product, the organization said.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that there is a box for each family may be one factor.
However, it can’t be said for sure,” said Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is being marketed as a product that reduces infant mortality and SIDS.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The package includes a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no safety standard for sleeping in cardboard boxes.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for sleeping if there is no cradle or cot available.
The organization recommends that you use the pack only for naps and stop using it when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the package and ensuring that they do not get wet or dirty.
A rogue escaped from a Japanese zoo for the second time.
Japanese zoo staff are looking for an escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff with its speed and has escaped for the second time in two weeks.
A turtle escaped from Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It doesn’t die right away because it eats grass around the zoo, but we’re very worried,” Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, said in a statement.
The 35-year-old escaped villain is a female, weighing 55 kg and about one meter in height.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the villain is allowed to walk freely in the garden area.
The zoo hasn't received any eyewitness reports of a turtle.
The last escape from the coven happened last week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along a road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on my way to the zoo.
“I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help,” Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These Startups Will Help Your Business Avoid Uber Errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
"The inquiries were simply not consistent or objective," says Errett. As his hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of human resource startups have entered the market, helping other companies find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and population groups, and provide anonymous notification services to their employees and, in some cases, a direct connection to the board beyond senior management.
“You can monitor your health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit for companies?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint Startup in Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint’s software for three years and says he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can be used to make quick surveys and polls for specific teams. It can also be used to create a map that shows at a glance which departments have the most dissatisfied employees and which managers have the lowest ratings. This has allowed Errett to get to the root of the problem.
Businesses have understood that they need to follow the workplace culture to avoid becoming the next Uber. The transport company has been in turmoil since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture in which workers are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such neglect is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global industry that could reach more than <0x24>118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let’s Talk Payments.
Based in Denver, Colorado, Convercent is a start-up that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year as Uber’s reputation was hit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He also recently signed a contract with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to tailor-made surveys, collect responses confidentially in real time, and identify problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by text message.
And if there is reason to suspect the director of impropriety, the complaints go directly to the board of directors of the company.
“Public opinion has supplanted the authorities,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company mistreats its employees or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene, and consumers can start boycotting the company, as well as losing employees and being sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have easy access to headquarters.
Previously, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he first had to find out the phone number or email address with which he was able to file the report at the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, Lawyer at Ruby Tuesday. According to him, it was difficult to follow complaints from employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from managers working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the employee's reality," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical actions in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only through social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent the public from clearing up their dirty laundry.
“Hope was used as a strategy before technology came into the control of ethics,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for use.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by venture capitalists. Both Glint and Convercent are supported by venture capitalists.
In February, Convercent raised <0x24>10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising a total of <0x24>47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of <0x24>60 million.
Investments are not a surprise given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, workers expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
“Employees will be more committed to the success of the company if they feel comfortable in the company and feel listened to and rewarded by their work,” said Nina McQueen, Executive Vice President, Employee Reward and Wellbeing at LinkedIn.
Investors make a profit when companies are successful. Companies are successful when employees are engaged.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it’s no wonder they’re of interest to investors.
According to workplace culture experts, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it will be useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If the company asks its employees for feedback, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if change doesn’t come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be ready to have four thousand conversations,” said Russell Raath, CEO of management consulting firm Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on just gathering information.
"If the company does not take action, employees will start to wonder if they have been consulted.
And whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting monthly staff surveys and is able to address the problem on the same day as announced on Glint.
After collecting feedback from frustrated employees about the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to the teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better than before and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve the long-term sustainability of its employees in an industry known for its high employee turnover.
"If a company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose its employees," Vitrano says.
If it loses its employees, it loses its customers.
Without customers, there are no businesses.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of insinuating his naked female neighbor, according to the news agency TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at her home when she noticed a cell phone hanging at the end of a rope outside her window.
The woman said her cell phone camera took pictures of the apartment.
The woman, who was frightened by the incident, had run to another room to dress up.
When the woman arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon after it was lowered to the window again.
The 20-year-old suspect admitted to photographing a woman.
He said he only photographed a woman’s face.
The video was removed and the police were unable to return it as evidence.
In the interviews, the man admitted the crime, but denied having committed the crime.
The man said he loved his neighbor “very mad.”
According to the news agency, the man is charged with the case.
Teachers demand more money in autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed, said Olli Luukkainen, Chairman of OAJ, on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the possibility of concluding agreements that do not in any way include holiday money cuts.
Contracts in the municipal sector are not likely to be concluded until private sector papers have been signed and the percentage increases have been determined.
Luukkanen predicts that, for example, the working conditions of OAJ will be agreed in January.
Percentage targets have not yet been revealed.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a consultative organisation for public sector educated people.
Luukkainen: Holiday allowance cuts increase differences in earnings
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is deteriorating while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkanen, the temporary holiday money cut will further sharpen the differences in earnings.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many pupils per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the worst performers are constantly increasing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating and disparities between pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins Players Day Extended as NCAA Reduced Daily Exercises from Two to One
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening, and a group of UCLA American football players have been left to chat on the other side of the campus's new rehearsal ground.
Some of them have taken off their shirts and their backs shiny with sweat after the first day of training camp.
For many of them, this few-minute chat session is a midday break.
After three hours of rehearsal, the students return to the dormitory to read for the final exams, and the next morning they meet at the Wasserman Football Center at 7:30 p.m.
"The next three days are going to be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's shift to Tuesday.
The university sports umbrella organization reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one. The aim of the change was to lighten the workload of the players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final exams are held.
That’s why the first three UCLA rehearsals started at around 15:00 in the evening, and it was hard to find a place on the already full schedules of the players.
Limiting training sessions to one per day means that there are more training days. This year, the camp started almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in Mora’s six seasons of coaching at Westwood that training sessions are held at the same time as summer courses.
The rehearsals are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20th, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA will meet Texas A&M University in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA’s rule change, even though it made players’ schedules even tighter.
“We’re really putting a lot of weight on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They are great friends.
I think it'll get easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the rehearsals after the camp, which is not easy given the direct view from the rehearsal grounds to the adjacent parking lot and the Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the protective net behind the goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora said.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises from there on video. That's not an exaggerated concern.
The video of the exercises is paid a lot.
But we've got guards in there and in the parking lot.
We're doing our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan.”
Freedom in Rwanda
Presidential elections will be held in Central African Rwanda on Friday, and the winner is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking a third term, but in practice he has been influencing the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting the freedom of speech.
He has also been accused of misrepresenting poverty statistics.
Kagame will be able to run for a third term because the Constitution, which has been limited to two terms, has been amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
During his time, Rwanda has undergone social reforms and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in unifying the country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has prompted many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
Kagame, however, has promised his people more freedom after the country has been brought back to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up fact-checking
Facebook will increasingly send fake news to independent fact-checkers and present the results underneath the original article, the world’s largest social network announced on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to fact checkers and the results may be published underneath the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest distributors of fake news, and many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The subject has risen to political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news ahead of the May presidential election, and Germany, in preparation for the September elections, supports a plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that it will test the facts in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see which stories don’t pass the screening of independent auditors. They also want more background information to be able to decide more informedly what they’re reading and sharing,” Sara Su, product manager for Facebook’s news feed, wrote on the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook is continuing to test the Related Articles feature and is making other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Birth of a comic book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scotney Castle in the county of Kent is now known for Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
But it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it, and now this charmingly located castle in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old-fashioned moppie-haired writer.
“I think it’s great to be able to study a text written by a person who died over 300 years ago,” Rhodes said.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
The Rhodes book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different, promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I moved into tears when I noticed the thumbprint of a letter written by a double agent working for the Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
“It was his fingerprint.
And the letters smell like smoke, because at the time, the lighting was using fire.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he or she is on the spot.
I love the archives!”
With the support of the National Trust and the National Arts Council of England, the author, who was attracted to old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures, and rarities, such as hyena heads hung on the walls and bottles in the moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes also artists illustrating the book.
In the evening, he “takes a whiskey and starts writing.”
The history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the castle was not fully transferred to the National Trust until the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the foundation’s staff were just about to begin a search of the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: taking everything extra to the attic.
The archives included diaries, letters from the times of the English Empire, and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "But here the families were fighting for even one birch.
I think we should just let it go.”
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to English history, such as The Labourer, about a man who joins the English peasant rebellion shortly after the castle was completed in 1381.
"The book Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The English peasant riot started in the same area, and it occurred to me that the riot could start with a riot.
“Maybe these events are related?”
The other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of a priest that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The men in the family seem to have been quite mischievous, constantly in debt and buying things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problem by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome guys who knew how to cheer for the heiress."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Elämänmäki, a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, from which only a eutrophicated plot remains.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
“It was sad to leave,” he said.
“I didn’t want to go back to this damn thing.”
Russia is the worst country since the Cold War.
The relationship between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
“I think you can say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg told CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
However, Stoltenberg said NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid escalation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s remarks, US President Donald Trump said the relationship between the US and Russia had reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump called for thanks to the poorly-agreed Congress that approved new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitschko to stop rematch against Anthony Joshua
Vladimir Klitschko, long-time heavyweight champion of professional boxing, ends his career.
Klitschko, a 41-year-old Ukrainian, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitschko, who won gold at the 1996 Summer Olympics, fought as a professional 69 times, winning 64 games.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury scored in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost in the 11th round after a fierce match.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to meet at a rematch in Las Vegas in November.
Klitschko, however, found no motivation for the match.
"I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley match," Klitshko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I reached everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitschko’s reasons for his decision in the video.
Bernd Bönte, Klitschko’s manager, said in a statement that the decision to stop Klitschko was difficult.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitschko has been dating American actress Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple have one child, daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko’s older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the World Cup titles of different alliances at the same time.
Finnish weatherman witches conditions: "Vie vihistä"
Pole jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer outdoor iron season.
Nike has had some problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken away the woman's mood.
The World Championships in London also have unstable conditions.
Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The conditions have been this summer against the pole jumper Minna Nikka.
I don’t want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn’t get even the small poles to move properly,” Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I’ve been racing and practicing here so many times and I’ve never experienced such a varied breeze in this place,” Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin at Games.
This season it has been very difficult to standardize the jump, as the winds have been so unstable in the practice, Nikkanen said at the Kaleva races.
The weather was on Thursday in London.
It has been quite challenging to get the technology together - whether it's cold-jumping or not.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken me away.
There is no point in consuming energy in a bad situation.
He made it to the 455th World Championships.
The 445 is out.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to be calm and wait for better winds.
The goal is to cross Friday’s qualifier 460.
Why don't you move to work abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got the leap and the technology was standardized.
I probably should have done the same thing now.
Normally I have been able to practice in the hall, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal race?
25 degrees Celsius.
A little wind, as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-officer reviled politicians at Yle: "We have no margin for dividends now or for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, the government of Juha Sipilä must keep ice in the hat and be careful not to inflate the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets in the Ministry of Finance for decades.
He says there is no distribution.
Yle interviewed Virta, who had retired in 2015, at Wednesday’s Ykköamu.
The construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, politicians’ suggestions for raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and supporting e-bikes have emerged, Virtanen says as election speeches.
They mainly tell us that the elections are getting close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no margin for distribution now and for many years to come.
I think it is even fraudulent to talk about a distribution thief when debt is taken, Virtanen said to Yle.
He said that all debt is owed to children.
Virtanen has a long experience in the preparation of state budgets: in 1978 he joined the Ministry of Finance as Secretary of the Budget and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Head of the Budget.
The last time he retired, he was the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
Virtanen pointed out in Yle’s interview that the now forecasted 3% of economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is the spike from which we will start going downwards as early as next year, and Finland is expected to grow by one per cent for decades.
Washington to change permanent residence permit rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump has announced that a new immigration plan will change the rules for permanent residence, the Green Card.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to restrict family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages, and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
“The new application process will benefit applicants who speak English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The Queen of Denmark’s wife does not want to be buried with the Queen in the same place.
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Prince Henry and Queen Margaret in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her husband, Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried side by side.
Traditionally, the rulers of Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT, the reason for this is the prince’s dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It’s no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy,” Lene Belleby, head of communications at the court, said in a statement.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her husband’s wish for a burial place and understands the decision.
A moment of terror on the road: the car was about to come on the highway
Tom had a cohabiting partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but will not receive the money from the insurance if the other party cannot be reached.
The accident happened at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo of the construction site of Ring III.
Tommi, from Vantaa, says his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his cohabiting partner Riina and the couple’s two young children drove on the motorway at Keimolanportti in Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From the exit of the Ring III to Hämeenlinna fairway, a white car was driving along the acceleration lane, which was about to drive to the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without the evasive move, the car would have come on top of Tom.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand,” Tommi says.
The family car crashed into the railing at high speed.
The parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is slightly less than 3 years old, the other is less than 1 year old.
I guess we were pretty lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one drove past us, even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident occurred around 5:20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue personnel arrived and the family was checked.
The car went into redemption.
Tommi says that he and his cohabiting partner have a small income, and they received a family grant to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information about the other car, Tommi says the family will not be able to get the money from the insurance.
That’s why the family wants eyewitnesses to see the car that drove the family to the railing.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take the children to the kindergarten and work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, older car.
It was probably in the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the car registration number was SIG.
If we don't catch the culprit, I don't know how we're going to make it financially, we're going to have to count every inch these days.
Tommi hopes that anyone who has seen or knows about what happened will be in contact with the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they had a mission at the scene of the accident on Tuesday night.
The title and the case were corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally reported in the case, the other car did not come from the lane of the incoming car, according to Tommi, but was to drive from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
The performance directed by Lotta Jäppinen is about human relationships by means of humor - The self-exposer will be seen in the What? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her debut directing to the What? theatre.
The self-exposer is a musical theatre performance about past relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good mood.
The subject is dealt with by humor.
There are no bad feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance has been executed with a tiny budget and a big, young heart.
The name of the performance challenges you to think about what a person reveals about themselves when they get to know a new person.
Is he going to play a role or is he approaching another man with his coat open?
A sketchless performance confuses fact and fiction
He has both directed and dramatized the show.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and there is no plot.
The director believes that while the performance draws on the thoughts of young people, it addresses people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasises that the Self-Revealer does not directly tell about his or her relationship with the working group.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my values will be reflected in the performance.
I don’t think that relationships are bad, but neither do I think that relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents.
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Exhibitor draws a current picture of young adults living in a hundred-year-old Finland.
Many have learned a great deal from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance features Minea L<0xC3><0xA5>ng, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The team also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The arrangement of the music is Jäppinen and Rokan.
Love for the theatre sparked in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying to direct theatre expression at Turku University of Applied Sciences.
It's been two years, and there's another one ahead.
Jäppinen’s enthusiasm for theatre has started during the Kouvola years.
The teacher of music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has performed at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Linnateatteri in Turku.
Steering is becoming more and more interesting.
The self-exhibitor premiered last week in Helsinki on Narri’s stage.
The 45-minute performance is expected to take place in the future at least in Jäppinen’s study city Turku.
Exhibitionist at the Kouvola What? Theatre on 4th of August at 7 pm and on 5th of August at 2 pm and 7 pm.
The Finnish Olympic champion recovered from a terrible motocross accident for a year - his neck was broken
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural force as Janne Lahtela.
An ace of bivalve landing toured the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased her dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only an untiring trainee, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that a person from Kemijärvi would not have tried at least once.
It has inspired me to practice.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one of the hobbies was to stop Lahtela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both arms were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I licked my wounds at home for a year, Lahtela says.
Lahtela was bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a role in the accident.
Driving a motorcycle can sound crazy.
But I didn't go for boundaries with it.
It's just so hard as a sport that a 40-year-old like this shouldn't be too much of a hobby!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
He was the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started his career in Pest right after he ended his career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to sit still.
I didn’t really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during his training, Lahtela often challenged his protégés in slope and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my thoughts didn’t make sense.
Not even in the species.
It was good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because I was able to just be there for once.
A mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become Finland’s head coach.
Without stopping, he was afraid he would have burned out.
It’s easier to find places that are broken than intact!
Without the accident, I would not have realized that I needed to rest so much.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle national team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed sports.
I switched motocross to frisbee golf!
It just got out of hand right away.
At its worst, I spent seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela has always been a super enthusiastic trainer, she does not demand that her coaches be like her.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
In our sports culture, there is space to be of its own kind and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it,” Lahtela says.
The sex robots are coming and we need to be worried
It’s here: a report on technological advances in the sex robot industry – just as it started to feel like 2017 couldn’t get any weirder.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5 to 10 years.
“We need to start taking sex robots seriously,” said Noel Sharkey, a founding member and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of their nipples and the type of fingernails.
"They're talking about sex robots, but they're already selling a lot of them, and we're going to see more of them," Sharkey said.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with a warm silicone skin and features created by artificial intelligence that resemble human behavior.
The user can also customize the robot to their own preferences, ranging from eye color to nipples shape and type and color of fingernails.
What’s even more worrying is that robots have a “personality” that makes Stepford’s women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of a RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, for example, shy.
True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as perfectly as possible to the user's personality," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, in the mood, or in the mood.
There are many worrying features in the rise of sex robots. They replace real relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies when the user approaches a robot that is programmed to be shy and resisting, for example.
True Companion on its website compares the Roxxxy robot to a vibrator:
"Women have vibrators, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their prevalence and development reveals something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession from gender equality to sexual intercourse, where oppression is an option among others.
Of course, the majority of men do not purchase sex robots, and their popularity remains marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell us a lot about the spirit of time.
And many people only start acting strangely or offensively when the market allows them to do so.
It’s no coincidence that sex robots are becoming more common at a time when women’s rights are under threat around the world and there’s a president in the White House who has bragged about harassing women.
The Handmaid’s Tale (Slave Girl) is not the most worrisome in its powerful imagery, such as pictures of hanged bodies and excavated eyes, but the most disturbing is how realistic the world feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
They try to make sex robots as much like real women (with the proportions of porn stars) as technically possible.
The developers of robots want their skin to feel real and their movements to mimic human movements as much as possible.
However, their “personalities” are far from reality.
A robot cannot leave a relationship or situation.
They have no will or history of their own—nothing that points to independence or that breaks the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slave girl.
Police suspect two terror attacks planned in Australia, led by ISIS chief
An ISIS leader led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb to an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders of ISIL had also sent building blocks of the bomb to Sydney.
The bomb was supposed to be transported to the plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before the security check.
The police did not explain why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that emits toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as public transport.
Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said the plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation continues.
The good side of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like the premise of common sense
In the Trump era, it has been repeated to the frustration that the strong divergence of the electorate has also broken up families on a daily basis.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers’ counseling forums provided guidance on how to get along with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to break our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump’s ability to unite families.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been at odds with our family's Republicans.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousin’s acquaintances — including a Republican-minded sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades — are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but in a broader sense, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given the left a new boost, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we are talking about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to terrify his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrifying possibility that Trump will normalize the right-wing Republicans, which, compared to Trump, suddenly seem quite reasonable.
I am saddened by Mitt Romney’s subdued version of insanity: a dog on the roof of a car, an income tax of 14% (and we have seen his tax returns at least). Compared to Trump, they seem like very mild violations.
When Trump’s term is over, the Republican next presidential candidate just needs to be sober, and that immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting, we took our kids to the Central Park carousel, the biggest carousel in the New York park department, and the best one in New York for <0x24>3 without caffeine.
The carousel’s horses are huge, the characters in the middle – the cheeky clowns and the animals looking back in terror – are ominous, and the giggling music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s hallmarks become disappointing over time: the views from the tall buildings start to get bored, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar, and the city’s reality does not match its dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I'm not over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a big roundabout in north London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss pub, but it doesn't count.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience —to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two forty-year-old women enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but luckily no one came to ask me any questions.
Instead, I was asked at the department store this week to rate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on the reader.
It’s the same thing in the cafeteria in my neighbourhood, but I’m also given the opportunity to combine 15% service fee with the estimate when I go to get my coffee from the counter.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service staff to put their personality into the game when it is not needed.
The store saleswoman smiled apologeticly when I gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter - "There was no trust from the management"
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuqi from the role of coach of the club’s representative team.
Fabrizio Piccareta, former assistant coach, is responsible for the coaching.
The rest of the team will continue in their current roles.
Piccareta has previously served as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
The 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter coaching team in January, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan H<0xC3><0xA5>kans, chairman of the board of FC Inter, regrets what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuqi no longer had the trust of the club’s management, so there was no other option now,” H<0xC3><0xA5>kans said in a statement.
The Piccareta contract is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he will be in charge of the home game against HIFK tomorrow.
According to news reports, the team has been in a state of turmoil all Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that the club’s assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen had been removed.
Kuqi and Piccareta had a strong match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a picture of her youth from the '80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violinist Linda Lampenius posted a photo of her youth on Instagram.
Several hashtags have been added to the picture, which suggest that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders about a young woman looking seriously at the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he was texting.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published photos of his past and also talked about painful topics.
About a year ago, she posted a photo of herself on Instagram.
In one photo she is seen 20 years ago, in the other she is now posing as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a human being and refers to eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
“I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I’ve learned to like myself and how I look,” Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating craze in previous years.
At the age of 14, he was in the hospital for anorexia and orthorexia.
She also developed bulimia, which was not discovered until 2006.
The healing began gradually.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius delivered from prison to hospital for chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for cuts to his wrists, which prison authorities said he received after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the prosecutors appealed the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in a toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again because they consider Pistorius’ six-year sentence to be too mild.
The prosecutor will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal will probably be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is upheld, Pistorius’s sentence may be extended to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camp in Greece
Two illegally encamped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the country's foreign ministry said on bTV.
Police arrested a group of unauthorised campers in Sithonia on the morning of 1 August, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced the release of the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free campsites and already impose substantial fines on anyone who camps in areas other than designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
The liquid particle is sinking - has already sunk -7.7%
Neste’s share has plummeted by 7.7 percent around 11 a.m.
Its earnings before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
Stock exchange trading has started today on the mild side of frost, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of the stock exchanges, the large European Stoxx 600 index had plummeted by 0.2%.
After about half an hour of trading, the Helsinki Stock Exchange’s general index OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points and the most traded companies OMXH25 had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The total turnover of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which nine million was the result of the morning's announcement by Neste.
Red Meat, Dairy Products and Chocolate May Relieve Irritable Bowel Syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmares of the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK, causing stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen bowel tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, head of the study, the immune cells guard the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes in food do not enter the body.
The cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome may result.
Experiments showed that immune cells that increase tolerance are present in mice that have a specific bacteria in their intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan in order for immune cells to begin to appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a link between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of tolerance-promoting cells. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal gut microbiome," says Professor Colonna.
"The more tryptophan there was in the diet of mice, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
When studying immune cells that strengthen tolerance, postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, mice of the same species, which were kept separate from the other group, did not have them.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiome of mice, i.e. the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was examined, six species of bacteria were found in mice that had immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were administered to sterile mice that did not have a gut microbiome and did not develop immune cells, immune cells began to form.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system by growing Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in a liquid and transferring small amounts of fluid – without bacteria – to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells evolved into tolerability-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice’s diet, the number of cells that strengthen tolerance increased by about 50 percent. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria allow cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
“We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines,” says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their prevalence."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "genius" after signing a deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a "genius" after signing a deal with Nemanja Matic, who made his debut in the Manchester United squad against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
With <0xC2><0xA3>40 million from Chelsea, Matic started with a 2–1 win in Dublin, United’s final pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic wasn’t in the best shape yet, as he wasn’t on the blue shirt tour of Asia before the season started. He only managed 45 minutes on the pitch – according to Mourinho, that has to change before the Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and way of thinking make him a genius - he has the innate ability to think football," Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him be ready sooner rather than later.”
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began filing for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a “great job” by acquiring three of the four players he prioritizes.
"Three out of four - you have to thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women tease Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's national volleyball team lost their fourth game of the World Cup qualification tournament to Germany in straight sets 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany’s standard of play is high.
Their game was smooth in every sector, Finland’s head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two rounds, Finland held its opponent tight, but in the third round Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the group.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we were able to swing along,” Kangasniemi said.
Finland’s most effective was Piia Korhonen, who scored 14 points.
Three of the four games lost, Finland will still face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: A grand jury has already sent challenges in connection with Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russia
In the United States, a grand jury has sent challenges in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent out challenges in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for her Kremlin connections.
Reuters also confirmed the news that the Wall Street Journal had revealed on Thursday that a grand jury had been convened.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent challenges in connection with a meeting between Trump Jr. and Kremlin-related veteran Veselnitskaya, which took place in mid-US presidential elections in June 2016.
Donald Trump’s then campaign chief Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, current White House adviser Jared Kushner, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington, D.C., means a tightening of the pace of the Russian investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted the grand jury to help investigate Russia’s involvement in the US presidential election and whether Trump’s campaign or his associates cooperated with Russia in the matter.
A grand jury extends Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges, and force people to testify under oath.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence that the prosecutor has investigated and decides whether the case should be prosecuted.
British inventor microchips himself to get into his home and car with a wave of his hand
The British inventor is the first person in the country to microchip himself so he can open the front door of his home, get into his office, and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forefinger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, who is now offering a service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam’s BioTeq company.
Northam collaborates with Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the microchip is installed to meet medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technology as the microchips of cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also makes locks for houses and cars compatible with a microchip. Processing one lock costs <0xC2><0xA3>300.
Northam is married and has one child. He has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when he lays his hand on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House’s decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the White House’s southern lawn area for an event about American production cost taxpayers <0x24>24,000, according to military documents obtained by the TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, known as Marine One while the President is on board, was the attraction at an event in the White House on July 17, 2017, where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials came across the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter produced in Connecticut, there were a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter to be stationed by a mission-specific order only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an "extraordinary" event, according to documents from the Navy HMX-1 Helicopter Squadron.
“I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this because this is an exceptional event that is gaining a lot of visibility,” the HMX-1 unit commander wrote in an email to his superior, who is the deputy commander of the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn on 17 July at seven in the morning and the event would begin at three in the afternoon. The helicopter would leave the site only after the lawn was cleared between six and nine in the evening.
In addition, the message stated that if the helicopter was delayed leaving the White House, a second crew would be needed due to the limitations of the service hours.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the incident, and the unit’s security personnel were at the helicopter’s site while it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by the TIME magazine whether another crew was ultimately needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the incident violated the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told not to be violated," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At the event, the President spoke in favour of health care reform, which was then discussed by the Senate, as well as looser state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels,
But their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump’s actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of a presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor’s presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the 'Made in America' event, which introduced American workers' products made of American materials from all 50 states," White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train in the southern lawn to bring the President to the White House to inch accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew’s monthly training quota.
On that day, the unit’s helicopters also flew for 11 hours in “non-presidential support missions.”
According to the White House, there were no other costs for taxpayers.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organising a demonstration of the helicopter in the White House’s southern lawn.
HMX-1 does not have records of flights related to the duties of the president, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence’s 2017 hourly allowance, the compensation level for the VH-3D helicopter is <0x24>24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 records, flights from the Quantico base to the White House and back from Virginia lasted an hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes personnel, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs that are taken into account in the annual allocation."
According to a 2015 RAND study, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
“I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and employing hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked so hard for.
It is perfectly appropriate to point this out."
It’s not certain if Trump was in the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat in the driver’s seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president. "I have three of them."

Venezuela's Attorney General Calls for Justice to Prevent the Appointment of a New Representative
The Venezuelan state prosecutor has requested a court ruling that would prevent Venezuela from appointing a new representative.
Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro has announced that a representative body elected last Sunday is scheduled to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative body was elected, which can, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
Prosecutor-General Luisa Ortega said the decision to block the election had been requested because of allegations of election fraud.
Ortega has also launched an election fraud investigation.
He appointed two judges to the position after the British company that held the poll said that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about a million more than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated, and Maduro's son and wife are among the 545 members of the elected council.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the Council of Representatives may dissolve the opposition-led Congress and amend the laws.
Maduro was described as a dictator.
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitutional reform as a way of strengthening Maduro’s position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro, calling him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, for their part, have declared that they will not recognise the new Council.
Maduro argues that the new council is a solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
The unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
Many people have been injured and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela plunged into an economic crisis after the fall in oil prices.
Nowadays, many people cannot afford food or medicines.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new representative body is scheduled to begin.
Russian man extradited from Finland sentenced to four years in prison in the United States
The Minneapolis court on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for his involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a U.S. demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah over to the US judiciary in February 2016, despite Russian protests, according to AFP news agency.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud, which had earned him millions of dollars in profits.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry reprimanded Finland after the arrest and said that the man should not be extradited to the United States.
In the statement, Finland and the United States were criticised for having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing about it in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to further redirect internet traffic, which used to make click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Department of Justice’s Crime Department, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt down other active cybercriminals.
“We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice,” Blanco said in a statement.
Edited at 8:58 p.m.: Corrected the transcription of the name of the convicted person.
Narcos’ third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel will star in Netflix’s hit series
While the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed the third and fourth seasons of the series. The trailer for the third season has been unveiled and introduces the new villains of the series.
In season three, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world’s richest drug trafficking organization.
The organization, led by the four godfathers, operates “like a Fortune 500 company,” except that there is a little bit more corruption and violence by the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages connections with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>ana, who recruits U.S. and Colombian police to fight the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos begins on September 1.
Kari Kola creates an exceptional light artwork in Paris
Light artist Kari Kola (Kuavssa) from Joensuu will create an exceptional light artwork in honour of the first Day of Light set by the United Nations in Paris on 16 May next year.
Kola makes a light artwork called Day and Night in Paris.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the Fontenoy building and the Globe Monument in front of it.
I want to emphasize not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make the things I feel important concretely visible, says light artist Kari Kola about her work.
I am very impressed by the invitation to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme day,” Kola continues.
Kari Kola participated in the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated the UNESCO headquarters in honour of the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to re-imagine my art at UNESCO headquarters,” says Kari Kola.
The work may be expanding significantly.
We will announce this later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light to humanity and to raise people’s awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fighting in shopping mall parking garage in Espoo
Two men got into a fight at the Iso Omena car park in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute started when the other party accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was a quarrel between the drivers.
A driver driving in a forbidden direction would hit the driver of another car, as a result of which the driver’s car started to run, colliding with the hitter’s car.
After that, he hit the hood of the car that hit him.
The man admitted in a preliminary speech that he had caused the damage and that he had done wrong.
Timo Soini's question mark: "Then came the Flood"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Uv.) published a blog post on Thursday, which is titled with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came the flood, now everything floats, writes Soini.
The text of Soini contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the Flood parable.
Depending on the interpretation, the utterances “after us the Flood” or “after me the Flood” have remained in the books of history.
Afghan Democracy Depends on Women’s Political Role
Elections will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote in the elections, the head of the U.N. embassy in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the interim head of the UN relief mission, said: “There are hundreds of women running for provincial councils, three are running for vice president, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and included in all aspects of the electoral process.
Afghanistan’s provincial council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have made threats to the elections at a time when the international force is moving into an advisory role.
This year’s elections will be the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said women's contributions would strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The flood of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The rage of the locals is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and Flee" tourism: you're just a few hours away and rush through the sights in a crowd.
Venice is suffocated by tourists making quick day trips to the city.
The narrow streets are difficult to get around and the fine squares are so crowded with visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move ever further away from the historic centre, while hotels have replaced homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian report on the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you are given two or three hours of time.
You follow the flag-bearing guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square and turn back," said Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini, describing the prevailing and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of the cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in the historic centre of Venice.
St. Mark's Church is located on the outskirts of the market.
Local indignation is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has degraded their quality of life, ruined the environment and driven residents away.
About 2,000 people leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be only tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic catastrophe," said Carlo Belframe, who was organizing the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring Venice the income it so desperately needs and create a need for a number of jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is planned to move the cruisers away from the historic center.
In the opinion of Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the Venetian administrative district, in which Venice is also located, were given more power to decide its own affairs, if not full autonomy.
Every year, between 20 and 30 million tourists visit Venice.
Are you driving in Kuopio?
Heavy kilometre-long traffic jams on the motorway
On the highway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi to the north, there have been kilometres of traffic during the return journey from work on Thursday afternoon.
The area is undergoing highway resurfacing work, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
There is a 50 km/h speed limit for road works instead of the standard 120 km/h speed limit.
Even in the 50-kilometre restricted area, traffic had progressed at walking speed in some places on Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday afternoon, the roads progressed on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi near the statue of Revelation, or Golden Goat.
I get along well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has been subjected to public cursing.
Amalie Iuel has published some great pictures of herself in the Grand Canyon.
Danish-Norwegian athlete Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her current home country Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400-metre race in March by lap 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400m hurdles at the Norwegian record time of 55.38.
Using social media hard, Iuel soon found, after his record, that celebrity and publicity have their downsides.
Men from all over the world began to send photos of their genitals to Iuel, apparently in the hope that a young runner would become interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account from outsiders.
I got a lot of "sham pictures" from strangers, so I was forced to turn my account into a private one," Iuel told VG.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of photos he received.
Guess you can guess, Iuel was laughing.
It’s nice to get feedback after the run, but I get along well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was two years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, her family moved to Namibia, then Pakistan, for her father’s work.
Then came Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, from where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship for Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask questions, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has a lot more time to deal with the athlete in person,” Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian record for 400 metres and 400 metres hurdles.
Foot injury took snowboarder Janne Korvi's entire career to the forefront - now in the World Championships: "It's nice not to hurt"
It has been nice to count now that nothing has happened!
One of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, Janne Korpi, 31, has been able to truly enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, his career was at stake.
The leg injury had forced Korvi to the operating table in January, and he didn’t want to get any better.
His hand had also taken a hit in the race.
In the summer, I didn’t know what I was doing, whether I was going to continue to skate or not.
The sponsorships were broken and a lot of things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, things tend to work out.
The leg got better, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood started pulling up the slope again.
The subsequent decision was easy.
I knew it when I first went to the snow.
I was like, damn it, this is so much fun again, let's go for a couple more seasons.
Korpi was not able to count properly until September-October, but after a long billing break, just training painlessly has been a big deal.
There have been only a few races in Korpi.
I don't mind.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're going to have a fever that week.
I can’t think like that, Korpi says.
Today, Korpi competes in the halfpipe of the World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though the individual races do not keep him on board, in tough company he always catches fire from racing.
According to Korvi, the competitions organised by the International Ski Federation have grown in appreciation in recent years, even though some of the boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
This is an important event, the visibility is great.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of the competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in Finland’s 12-member team in Sierra Nevada.
The team’s pits, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It’s nice to see younger friends.
I remember when I was myself at the point where everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It will bring new energy to myself, Korpi thinks.
I can still catch up on the slopes, but otherwise I can't, that's how much power my friends have!
Behind the boarding career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of director legend Pekka Korve is addicted to racing sports: the skateboarder has his own racing horses for which he does training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, there's no more time to be in the mess.
But every day I watch at least the results of the treatment and usually some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korvi, trekking guidance and trekking coaching are a potential career plan when the boarding career will be completed in due course.
I don’t want to go that far, but it’s at least a probable option.
I feel like I’m studying it here, along with snowboarding.
I try to keep up with the times and improve, maybe in the summer I’ll drive some departures too.
If this is my future profession, then it is not difficult to start it when you are already in the sport.
The ravi stories also include the Elitloppet ravi cruise with the host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship that will head to Stockholm for the Elitloppet race at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has sold well and people have been excited.
We are at a point where there will be no bankruptcy.
We still have a few months left, hopefully we can get the boat full, Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo’s nursing home project at Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new care home for the elderly, which will be built in Kitee.
The 1,700-story-square-metre building is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of Terveystie, neighbouring the health centre.
At Kitee, a common cause of wonder is that there will be enough customers for the new care unit, because now during Siu’s time, many private care homes have a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Care Services at Attendo, commented that Kitee will have increased demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, the freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year Attendo bought private nursing homes Kanerviikkola and Eerika from Kitee.
The deal involved business, but the property is reportedly a five-year lease.
Flink says there is no acute need for Attendo to move operations away from these facilities.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's factory in Scotland
The union is seeking confirmation from McVitie's incendiary executives for a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish branch of GMB, the general trade union in Great Britain, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products factory employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the company that owns McVitie's, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives “will certainly be the first to be informed” if there are any changes in operations.
In a letter to the plant manager, GMB urges the company to "respond to concerns that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of the production lines".
Drew Duffy, the GMB trade union, finds it extremely worrying that the factory manager is not able to provide clear information about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have been working here from generation to generation, and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and in the Glasgow metropolitan area, and the factory is a major source of employment in areas of high unemployment and low livelihoods.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, rising cost of living, and the continuing reduction in production, East Glasgow is in dire need of successful McVitie's production."
According to a spokesperson for Pladis, the factory manager had only received the trade union letter the day before, and the company responded directly to the letter because it appreciates the continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
Among other things, we discussed with our employees that, like other companies in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we are constantly evaluating all of our businesses and locations in order to remain competitive.”
In recent years, the company has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in Tollcross’s plant, especially in its production lines and operations.
“We are aware of Tollcross’s long history as a manufacturing facility and will be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we intend to make any changes to the factory’s operations.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain won’t give up on Neymar after paying <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to end the deal, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record-breaking move three years ago?
A sensational move is the most talked about event of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record for transfer sums. The previous record was less than half smaller: it came about when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer sum of <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive footballer and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, with PSG offering him a weekly salary of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about PSG’s actions and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. A source near Barcelona says the club has been taking very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG president warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG’s top-ranked clubs.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they want our players, we'll be their opponents and we'll contact their players," he said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they want our players, they will have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to be guilty of this: it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.
Neste slowed down the stock market's rise - Stock exchange news - Ilta-Sanomat
Metsä Board, the second great publisher of the results, was lower.
The large European general index Stoxx 600 had risen by 0.1 per cent at the closure of Helsinki.
The Helsinki Stock Exchange’s general index OMXH rose by 0.1 per cent to 9542.08 points.
The most traded companies OMXH25 made the same progress.
The total turnover of the stock exchange amounted to EUR 469 million, of which EUR 67 million was Nokia and EUR 59 million was Neste.
In the replacement tip, Nokia tilted 0.3 per cent to EUR 5.51.
The next oil refiner, Neste, packed 5.1 per cent.
The company’s pre-tax earnings deteriorated, but exceeded its forecasts.
Turnover, on the other hand, surpassed forecasts.
In particular, sales volumes of renewable products increased.
The company expects the world’s crude oil stocks to remain at a high level despite Opec’s production cuts.
Outokumpu, a steel company, rose by 1.6 per cent and Fortum, an energy company, by 1.3 per cent.
Stora Enso’s R-share increased by 0.2 per cent.
Metsä Board's profit before taxes and net sales increased from last year.
The company expects comparable operating result to improve in the current quarter.
The company’s result was supported by record-breaking cardboard deliveries and the rise in pulp prices.
The result was slightly weaker than expected.
Volumes developed positively.

Trump’s phone calls were invented – White House spokesman: “I wouldn’t say it was a lie”
The White House admits that the two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, according to the New York Times.
Trump’s calls to both the Mexican president and the head of the scout organization have turned out to be inventive.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said no calls had been made.
But he said Trump wasn’t lying.
According to Sanders, many of the scout leaders spoke to Trump in person, and he had discussed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
"These conversations happened, not just on the phone, but face-to-face," Sanders said.
Speech to Scouts aroused Disapproval
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president had called him and praised Trump’s successful efforts to eradicate illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said few people will cross Mexico’s southern border anymore because they know that the trip to the U.S. border will be tough anyway.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government issued a statement saying that the call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump’s interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump cheered his speech at a major national scout organization meeting in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the scouts, he said it was the finest speech ever given to them.
“They were very grateful,” Trump said.
On Wednesday, the group said it was not aware of any of its leaders’ calls to Trump.
A statement by Michael Surbaugh, the head of the organization, in which he apologized to the Scouts for Trump’s speech, speaks for itself.
Trump’s speech at the group’s meeting was surprising, as it was exceptionally political in nature.
Among other things, he praised the results of the presidential elections last autumn.
