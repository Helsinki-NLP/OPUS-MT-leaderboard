9-year-old boy found on the run in Tampere
The police have had a search for a nine-year-old boy in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The disappearance of a boy who left West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police situation centre, the boy has been contacted and there is no risk to his life or health.
The boy's father told the Evening Sanoma about midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the aftercare.
The boy was found near the house, the father said.
Ronaldo tore the goal gap to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league over the weekend and continued his career in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal-going title turned, at least for a moment, to the benefit of the latter.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo was the top scorer of all time when he shot a visitor, Shahtar Donetsk, into the net with two shots from penalty kicks and one from the game.
Ronaldo raised his goal score to 80 when he scored 77 goals at Barcelona Messi before Tuesday.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has fallen in the Serie A football league since the beginning of the season, but in Group D of the Champions League he started with a strong 2-1 away win from Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by Juventus Alvaro Morata more than ten minutes before the end.
The City attack was dulled by the absence of knee-deep Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the Premier League this weekend, did not come to the pitch until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also suffered a hard time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after a 1-2 loss.
ManU’s 20-year-old Luke Shaw’s game lasted only 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking sliding tackle hit the attacking ManU deck so badly that Shaw probably broke his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the grass at Eindhoven’s home stadium about ten minutes before the medical staff took him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests 1-0 in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno paved for extra time before the break.
The PSV goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Champions League, Paris Saint-Germain started in Group A.
An Argentinian named Angel Di Maria changed his shirt from Manchester United to PSG.
Di Maria broke through from the right and raised the ball in the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been ranked among the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö is not the best benchmark in the league.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his starting club Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow CSKA lost to Wolfsburg in a group B game in Germany 0-1.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation – the president made the wrong speech
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe delivered the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has repeated the same speech he gave at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, 91, is still alive.
The main opposition party, the MDC, demanded Mugabe's resignation because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants hurried to say that the confusion had occurred only in Mugabe’s headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech discussed China's influence on the country's economy before and now.
Germany and Austria call for extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extra summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
President of the European Council Donald Tusk, who chairs the summits, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, heads of state should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to get more effective registration of those coming to Europe.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the internal affairs minister’s agenda, Merkel said.
Teacher Acknowledges He Shot His Girlfriend During Emergency Call
During an emergency call, Shannon Lamb, a shivering university teacher, told police that she shot her girlfriend and that the police had to come to her house.
Lamb emphasized that his "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the dead woman's close relatives can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on the page of the booklet: “I’m so sorry I wish I could undo this beloved Amy and she’s the only woman who has ever loved me,” the letter said.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed a respected history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
Police chief Lynn Buford of Delta State University said they heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths had risen by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police surrounded the ant.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb’s motive the day after the school shooting forced students and staff to hide behind locked doors.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, though he may have had problems.
The students said they were waiting for his lessons.
The police at Prentiss's place of death, Gautier, said Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked the "mighty people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb had told him that he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously applied for sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in the university’s salary policy meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him an automatic career development and an assistant professorship.
University principal William LaForge said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that "clearly there was something in Lamb's mind."
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb fled the campus, police tracked him down when he moved back to the Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile and a half south of his parents' house in the Greenville suburb of Mississippi, Washington County coroner Methel Johnson said.
Lamb's car was still running on the driveway.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to this particular house, even though Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The University has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who spent many years trying to teach Hairston to play the guitar.
He was quite a charmer at the time.
All the girls were molten wax when she was there, said now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson’s suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house on the banks of the river in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"She's really upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter, Abigail, that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing in the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together at some gigs.
O'Steen told me his daughter was making and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a number of online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainer at Gautier’s bar The Julep Room, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5 after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performances for a small audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were playing around and throwing pranks at each other.
So they were both pretty smart.
The deceased teacher, Schmidt, led the seminary program for first-year students and specialized in Indians and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the school.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday night, at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, a candlelight show was held, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the mass, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press author Emily Wagster from Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans contributed to the report.
The case has been corrected according to the police now saying that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it’s not hiring as many workers for the holiday season as it did last year, but a toy and baby products retailer says it’s giving current regular and seasonal workers the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, compared to 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
While the holiday season is months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help occupy stores as well as sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a very important professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also important for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s seat was next to me,” she said in the upcoming documentary film Back in Time.
The movie starts and I think that I'm just a fake prayer and a stretch of hand away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the film Back in the Future, which featured interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Return to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “To me, it’s undeniably the greatest time travel film of all time.”
Back in Time is available on demand, on DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN chief says Syria will not be resolved by military means
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s response to Russia’s increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict is “not resolved by arms,” and additional weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader once again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations with a view to finding a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - during the ministerial week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve".
Mr Ban called on the five permanent member states to show the solidarity and consensus they showed when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme when dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 Support Polls That Show That Donald Trump Is Serious
Some have tried to brand him as a wind breeze.
Others think he's just a joke.
Some are waiting for collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to squeeze Donald Trump off the top of the support polls, it hasn’t (yet) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national surveys, 10 have been led by Donald Trump in the two-digit number, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king’s nomination opportunities.
Of course, the election is only in the early stages.
These results do not mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators note that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leadership to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom could win a single state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he should have problems with general elections.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Association Club for Growth have noted Trump’s perseverance and began using his funds to overthrow him.
The following recent support survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity figures have taken a turn.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, support polls at Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed a real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Six out of ten Republicans have a positive attitude towards Donald Trump.
About three in ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In a support poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be “shocked” if he became a candidate.
Ben Carson alone generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent Trump).
The next most exciting thing?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be “unsatisfied” or “distraught” if the ruling party’s favorite Jeb Bush became a candidate.
The fiery nature of Trump is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 52 percent of Republican-minded voters at a national level think that a real estate king has a character that suits the president.
According to a Quinnipiac poll last week in the state of Iowa, which hosts the first party conference, the figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the right temperament for a leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post survey, 44 percent think that their character is not suitable for serving as president, and nearly six out of ten think that their character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four out of ten respondents said Trump was the most likely candidate to be nominated for the Republican nomination.
At the end of July, four out of ten voted for Jeb Bush.
Republican voters have not always had the brightest crystal ball at their disposal.
At this time in the last legislature, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters consider Trump’s campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans were in favour of another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump’s leadership, as anti-Trump support is divided among numerous other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump gets majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's on a par with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump-winning candidate?
If they were put against each other, Ben Carson would defeat Trump with a big 18-point difference.
The majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump-supported voters have decided who their vote will go to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say with absolute certainty that he will never change his mind.
46% said they might be able to change candidates.
Anyway, Trump’s biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump’s side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s pompousness will drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and harm rebranding attempts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll released on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so will Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson’s support now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in Monday’s ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose a non-political person than someone with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are “unsatisfied” and 21 percent are “really angry.”
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn meets David Cameron for the first time at Question Time.
Corbyn raises his first six questions shortly after noon, and is likely to be closely watched by both the media and Labour MPs.
Corbyn has called for “less theater and more facts” for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Trade Union Confederation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour leader’s decision to stand silent during the national anthem at Tuesday’s memorial service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain air war, has raised criticism among Conservative MPs and has been featured in several front-page articles.
Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn’s spokesman said he “stands up respectfully in silence” and that he acknowledges “the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War.”
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn’s shadow government, told BBC Two Newsnight that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, despite the fact that he believed the royal house should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's inner circle, citing differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says the differences in policy regarding the party’s role in the European Union and the government’s aid ceiling have also “accumulated” within the Labour Party since Corbyn’s appointment.
Corbyn said at a trade union meeting that the Labour Party was proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Smith, the shadow government’s secretary of labor and pensions, said the party was “very clear” that they were simply opposed to the government’s plans to lower the ceiling from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Corbyn will become the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the past decade when he was the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has "crowded" ideas into questions for the prime minister, and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Corbyn, a member of the Islington North Parliament, said that the nature of the Prime Minister’s Question Time is too contradictory and that he will refrain from both clever talk and speculating, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the finance secretary of the shadow government, will be his deputy in questioning classes when Corbyn is not attending – for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues may be allowed to speak at some point, and he has said that he has approached the President of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on the matter.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the kind of political theater that is often associated with the Prime Minister’s questioning hours, but he was later forced to admit his failure.
Since they began broadcasting in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure of the leader's judgment, his control over the House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, even though critics have criticised the Question Hour for having become a mockery that calls for far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people trained to be photographers
The city of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless youth are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

The value of the pound will increase as UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers showed a rise in wage growth in the UK, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the fastest since 2009, and it was considered to bring with it estimates of rising rates.
The pound rose over 1% against the dollar to <0x24>1,5505 and 0.84% against the euro to <0x24>1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at a 1.49 percent increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most prominent stock on the market and rose by 20 percent after competitor AB InBev approached it with a bid.
The deal would bring together two of the world’s largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose 0.9 percent after encouraging news from the rival luxury brand Richmont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures were not only better than expected, but also showed that sales in China – which is Burberry’s key market – had begun to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose 5 percent after the mining giant reported that it had raised <0x24>2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi’s shares were the biggest calculators in the index by 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation to “sell”.
JD Sports rose by 3.1 percent after the sportswear company announced its six-month earnings before taxes: an 83% increase to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Salaries Could Damage Expansion
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, said that raising the minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean “increasing the purchasing power of potential consumers.”
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could affect the company’s expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against Aldi intrusion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's attack in southern and western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in southern and western Australia before Aldi’s <0x24>700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores coming. Meanwhile, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food retailers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA merchants and suppliers have jumped in, and brands such as Simmo's, an ice cream maker from Dunsborough, offer tastings in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defense strategy on September 29 as this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler hosts the annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and Western Australia together account for almost 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA area, with higher profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
Shopping in South and Western Australia is known to be provincial and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 % in the South and 24 % in the West, compared to 14 % in the Eastern countries.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will capture about 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores.
In this week’s report, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers could lose <0x24>360 million in sales each year and Metcash could lose <0x24>250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 in the west next year, generating revenues of between <0x24>500 and <0x24>600 million in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and volumes at the Metcash High Fixed Cost Base could cost Metcash about <0x24>13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA’s customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash’s food and food sales to fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2020.
Hamish Douglass, the chief investment fund manager and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said last week at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could “very possibly lose in a decade.”
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of Metcash's board would have contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 % to 14 %, and the returns from Metcash’s food and food business, which distributes products to approximately 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 % since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of operations when sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler stands by, and has invested more than <0x24>150 million a year to bring the prices of hundreds of products down weekly to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, to help IGA dealers renovate stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and to bring a better range of private brand products to the market.
Ian Morrice, President and CEO of Metcash, says that falling prices and improving stores have increased attraction, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation chairman Steve Healy backs Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis Deserves Honor Rather Than Criticism of His Behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a bystander in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios, who deserves to be honored rather than criticized for his own behavior, said Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Federation.
The younger member of the talented duo called "Special Ks" Kokkinakis was involuntarily exposed after Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrina at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly after, in a fiery qualifier match in Cincinnati, the chief referee was forced twice to separate Kokkinakis from his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid."
While Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his bat after a cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been Kokkinakis's unwavering defender.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for the second place in a doubles match with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
"I think quite strongly that Thanasi is just being dragged into the fight," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost a cramp in the US Open, but he is not the first player to break his bat in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he is not proud of it.
But he has behaved very well, even in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature to be 19 years old, he works hard, fits in the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in good shape and he is quite a calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged by his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios in the important games starting on Friday, describing this “joint decision” as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the Canberra return to the team’s standings.
"We want the team to be completely focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as for example Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he is growing up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets. But we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time away from the public to reflect on these consequences.
European Immigration Crisis: Hungary Declares State of Emergency, Closes Borders, Arrests Immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of blocking the influx of migrants entering the country.
There was chaos at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in the neutral area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
The people who fled the violence in their home countries have now set up their tents and settled for an indefinite period of time on a roadside between the checkpoints of the two countries.
But the frustration increased.
While the police helicopter remained above them, the migrants shouted “Open the border!” and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” to send migrants back from Hungary as more and more of them arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
“Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The debate must take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came after a group of 28 nationalities failed to create a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities between 40 000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and they spoke optimistically about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take in 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an extra EU summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent’s migration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act soon.
Tuesday's emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to respond to the crisis and allowed you to close down and speed up asylum cases.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border has been completed, the country will also erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete a barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life, rather than those fleeing war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly contradicted by other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime an attempt to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the military positioning expected next week, but journalists from the Associated Press at the border have been seeing heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban’s homeland security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said 45 people had been apprehended by the authorities as they attempted to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already made it to the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now imprisoned by the police and are charged with violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will repair the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points at the border with Serbia after sending a trolley covered with barbed wire to close one of these points.
The main border crossing near Roszke in Hungary was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and the crowds tried to push in.
About 20 people got in, but thousands stayed outside.
A group of immigrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse to eat and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to a National Survey, Hillary Clinton’s leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue to lead the Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is squeezing her.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of the Democratic electorate (down from 58 percent) and Sanders is second by 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential race, but he is supported by 15 percent of the Democratic electorate.
More than five months before the start of the primary elections, most Democrat voters say it is still too early to say they have decided who to vote for.
Clinton’s supporters, however, stand more firmly behind their own choice than supporters of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has declined among several population groups since last month’s CBS News Poll, and at the same time, Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is a strong leader among women and moderates, but her leadership has narrowed.
His popularity with men has declined considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton has lost the lead among the Democratic voters under the age of 50, and she is now even with Sanders.
Clinton, however, clearly leads among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double-digit number among the Liberals, but now Sanders leads this group with five percentage points.
About half of the Democratic voters in the country say they will be eager to support Clinton if she becomes a candidate for the party.
A quarter says they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It’s not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely eager to support her.
Opinions are more confusing for those who do not currently support Clinton – only a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republican voters (35 percent) say the same about Republican No. 1 Donald Trump.
When Clinton’s supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted her as a candidate, the most popular answer was that she had the appropriate experience (16%). Since then, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for a female president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same views and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the vice president is influencing a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of Democrat voters would like to see him already in the race - even if a third disagrees.
When asked who would be second to the Democratic voters for the nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton supporters say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's leadership of Sanders will grow, if Biden joins, the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if he opts out, the figure will be 30.
55% of Democrat voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard Biden falls far behind, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most voting has increased.
When asked what is most important in a candidate, the Democratic voters, however, put their opinions before voting.
Last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was seen as an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well in certain key issues among their party voters.
The majority see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden is the best of the trio in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democrat voters say they don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don’t have an opinion about Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally feel that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically in agreement.
When you look at all of these things, about a quarter of Democrats say they don’t have an opinion about Sanders.
While Hillary Clinton’s use of her personal email address and server while she was secretary of state still raises questions, most Democrat voters welcome her explanation and say the issue did not affect their general opinion of her.
This is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
In March, public opinion was divided shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say email polemics didn’t affect their overall opinion of Clinton, even though 36 percent say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
More than six in ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
While Clinton’s own party voters consider her honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for her among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month, plus 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Both Trump and Clinton are considered good leaders.
Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest of the six candidates involved in the study.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but many have no opinion of him, just as they do not have an opinion of Carson.
The margin of error in a study involving 351 Democrat voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates collected half of all votes in the new poll, leaving the others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen from 23 per cent to 27 per cent of the previous CBS poll published Tuesday before the Fox News election debate.
At the same time, Carson rose from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well among different demographic groups and is pushing Trump out of the ranks of highly educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field is lagging behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has fallen the most: from 10% last month to 2% today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are ranked third at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey conducted in September is +/- 6 percent.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed that Carson is on the rise in polls: he has 19% Republican support, and Trump is 32% ahead of him.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson’s popularity rose last week, Trump criticized retiring neurosurgery for nothing, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of Baruch College First Year Student
Almost two years after the death of a student at the Brotherhood’s ceremonies in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of Baruch College, New York City, brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during a membership dispute in September 2013 and subsequently delayed his hospitalization, thus contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say that Deng’s eyes were blindfolded and a backpack of more than 13 kilograms of sand was loaded on his back, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field toward the finish line.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
Members of the Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, search the web for information about his symptoms, and contact the national president of the Brotherhood, Andy Meng, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus put the well-being of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by a blunt object in the head, body and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by the fraternity slaughter, with at least one student dying each year as a result since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
A grand jury in Monroe County has voted in favor of the first five members being charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent coercion and criminal intrigue.
"We don't want to hold individuals accountable, and if there is an organisation behind what happened, either formally or informally, they should be held accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood disbanded their connection to the local department.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
An increase in interest rates will come, and the market for rising rates will collapse, bond yields will rise, and the economy will face a recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will take or how long it will take.
The past doesn’t help much with timing, especially when it comes to the economy.
The recession has sometimes lasted only 11 months after the first lift, and sometimes as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates has often, but not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why the Federal Reserve has been so vigorously insisting that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are starting to rise, but mainly on the trajectory of a time of normalization.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about raising interest rates has been overstated.
"The first increase in the Central Bank since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the 'cheap money' era," Julian Jessop, Chief Financial Officer for Global Affairs at Capital Economics, said in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal, albeit still low, to be subject to the kind of catastrophic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it will not have any effect.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react based on past developments:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, waiting for an interest rate increase can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that returns on capital tend to stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first raise, which in turn potentially reflects a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the central bank raise.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market is generally strong, rising by about 14% as the raise approaches, 250 days after that the situation is fairly steady (average increase of 2.6 percent), and the normal state has been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4 percent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, a leading capital strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on shares is usually more pronounced at a later stage of the upward cycle when returns start to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rate increases often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not existed in the past, and which can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly the case with gross domestic product, which will be closest to its lowest level ever before the central bank raises its interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only been below 4.5% twice.
While the figure was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to stay as the third quarter progresses by 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy can be risky and raise the question of “is this time different?”
Market participants have been preparing for a central bank raise throughout the year, and everyone is looking forward to this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
While many strategists and economic experts believe that the committee can approve the increase at this meeting, futures trading only predicts a 25% probability.
“Our research shows that since 1950, all upward cycles have so far occurred in supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery has started,” the report says.
In contrast, the recovery from the recession, which has been the worst in the observation period, has now been exceptionally slow.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited by far the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and it is now the 74th month.
Fixed returns have also been volatile as the market awaits the interest rate increase, and the model is somewhat similar to observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes its policy, its effects are more visible in bonds than in shares.
The direction of bond yields appears to change immediately with the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the raise cycle, bond yields will fall immediately," Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will lead to a convergence of yields on long-term and short-term bonds, thereby smoothing the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often yield better in such a situation, although “we’re still cautious about looking for returns,” said Kathy Jones, Schwab’s fixed-income analyst, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank’s policy expectations.
“Besides the dollar’s strength and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the markets have adapted to the outlook for a tighter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is smoother, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly based in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high indebtedness perform worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have to finance.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks are generally more profitable in the three months after the first interest rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to customers.
Companies with strong net sales outperformed companies with weak net sales after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility stocks performed better than companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) for the former.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of floating-rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the appreciation of the dollar.
Savers can also make a profit with higher returns, even though experts disagree on how quickly the effect is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "popularization"
He argues that separating it from a commercial competitor is becoming increasingly difficult
In addition, he targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just mimicking the Brit Awards.
MEP Damien Collins criticizes The Voice, saying it is not original
BBC Radio 3 is “becoming” Classic FM, claims a senior MP, adding pressure to the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio channel appeared to be "popular" in its content, and that it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 — I don't want to use the term 'people-conscious' — is becoming Classic FM," he said.
He also directed the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
“The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seem to be just a different name for the Brit Awards.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember directly when you’re actually just copying something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitor in terms of live music and information to the public.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can’t learn anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first class.
"In addition, I think it's really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief Alan Davey argued that the channel must do more work than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC’s offering that was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music competition that the BBC purchased from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not unique in any way?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 show, starring Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced "in a BBC style."
He added that he wants the production company to “find success inside its own house” the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to stop the production of the upcoming seasons of The Voice, or to order that the money of the license payers be used for other forms of entertainment.
Online sales so far rose the least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month’s rise was the lowest since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for more than a decade, turning many of Britain’s shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are now signs of a flattening of online sales, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew the least since the beginning of the statistics in 2000: only a five per cent increase from last year.
Experts say there are signs of a flattening of online sales in the air, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would rationalize over time," Andy Mulcahy, a reporter on the JMRG sales index, told The Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales strengthened when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it's flattened, and (growth) can be reduced.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, has been considered one of the reasons behind the slowing down trades.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the event on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to grab shops, knocking down many merchants’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue about discoveries, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using shopping street fashion chains.
Muslims bury those who died in a crane crash in Mecca, consequences for the Bin Laden family
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies across the streets during first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partially blames construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for collapse
The Ministry of Health said 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
The 29 dead were carried in the air across the streets as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when a crane crashed in the Grand Mosque of Mecca.
The mourners, mainly dressed in white, filled the route to honor the first dead who made their last voyage to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A sad procession passed the holy place, where just a few days ago a crane fell through the roof of a mosque and knocked down worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial after the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed that the Bin Laden family building group was responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 worshippers killed by a crane at the Grand Mosque in Mecca were carried across the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when a crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already vowed that Hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to enter the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s executives were prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of a large mosque where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any announcements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The Royal Decision also accused the Group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the Grand Mosque of Mecca, which are part of a huge construction raid led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades, leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader Osama bin Laden was a rebel son who was banned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Authorities ordered one million rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to be paid to the families of the deceased and those permanently injured.
The injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss Says Eastern European Low-Cost Workers Are Popular
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and paintbrushes and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home improvement work
It seems that if you’re smart with a hammer or a hammer to paint walls, you’re in the minority now.
The British are hiring more and more assistants to do-it-yourself work in their homes, says the company’s boss behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement store chain, said the popularity is due to the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mock price.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by the prettier sex.
Nowadays, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: there are now more one-woman households doing more home improvement work than before.
Laury said: "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the decisions to buy products are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women to lead the most important companies in the UK FTSE100 index. She has rebuilt her management team with equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with exactly 50% women, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important thing here.
It hasn’t been difficult to find good women on the board.”
Kingfisher reported a decline in both six-month returns and sales after the group took on the cost of closing the stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The three-ace government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were seen quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee center organizations began to be forced immediately, and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to a widespread protest by the workers.
A lot of people think there is also reason.
Ask them if they should go on strike when things are going badly.
There was even a resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people have already come online to announce that they will not participate in the demonstration and will go to work.
In the good old days, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but openly declaring a rich person was a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unionists is not a big moment, but it gives cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, values have changed
From the point of view of the interestingness of the Ay movement’s operations, the government’s harsh decisions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of seemingly rolling things out on their own, now the unions finally get to the point of defending the rights of the worker, visibly and properly.
The government may thus wish to consolidate the role of the trade union movement, when membership in the trade union is perceived as perhaps more necessary than before.
No matter what you think about the actions of the organisations, it’s nonsense that Friday’s demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
University of Lappeenranta to save 8.5 million: 130 employees to be cut
Lappeenranta University of Technology is launching a savings course aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the University will start co-operation negotiations with all personnel, the savings target of which is 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
Another two million will be saved from other activities.
The background to the negotiations is the 2016 budget, which anticipates that the actual operations will have a deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by the government’s budget cuts.
In this fiscal year, the university will make a deficit of about 2.6 million.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding received from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is approximately EUR 85 million, which means that the savings target is ten per cent of the total budget.
The combined impact of the massive cuts in teaching and research and the decrease in corporate funding on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a statement from the University of Helsinki.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the decrease in supplementary funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will start on Tuesday next week and will last six weeks as required by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
Onnibus owner Sir Brian Souter from the UK tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in joining the Finnish railways.
My Stagecoach is one of the largest rail transport companies in the UK, says Souter.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first will be metropolitan area commuter traffic in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, it is long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transportation.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus’ plans.
Other international companies have expressed their interest in rail transport at least in Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also operates bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
The Federal Reserve must make decisions on interest rates.
The rest of the world is watching as the Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
When Reuters surveyed 80 economists, just over half of those who believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates now believe that the situation will not be resolved yet and that the interest rates will be kept at the current 0-0.25% level.
This is a historic event because it has been seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars into balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for a raise, but the signs also indicate they believe the odds are against the raise.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 8 p.m. (CET).
Delta State University Shooter Leaves Apology Message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before shooting a colleague later that day – Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying she was “excused” about the first murder and hoped she could “cancell it,” authorities said Tuesday.
Gautier Police in Mississippi reported that Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called 911 at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said he “killed his wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog” in the house that “doesn’t bother anyone” but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell them.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from 45-year-old Lamb saying, “I’m so sorry I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.”
After writing a note, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday when he was surrounded by police.
University principal William LaForge said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that "clearly there was something in Lamb's mind."
Officials said Tuesday that despite allegations that Lamb believed Prentiss had been in a relationship with Schmidt, there was “no information or evidence” of any kind of “triangle.”
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as a "good person."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O’Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was “shocked.”
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "everything best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from home, and Sun Herald said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles reported that Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said Lamb had called his relatives on Monday to tell them that “he is not going to prison.”
When police hit Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there, and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb received his doctoral dissertation on education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a curriculum vitae on the university’s website.
Stars Who Lost Their Attraction
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had a rough time in recent years.
In 2001, she suffered from leukemia, and in 2009, her long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
He also reportedly had drug problems and was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months after a double fracture
Luke Shaw got a double fracture in his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Even though the defender was in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by the reckless hit of Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day after that, and then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
He comes to Manchester United when he's 18, he's in trouble, and then he plays great, and now this is what happens.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it's gonna take at least six months for a double fracture, and he's not playing in the block stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Mr Van Gaal suggested that the Italian commissioner was mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged fight.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you for all your messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."

The English defender will have an additional incentive to recover at the European Championships in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player is forced out due to an injury like this, everyone is very sad.
The goal of our players is never to offend an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg when he played for Mexico against Van Gaal in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this very hard because it's not about hurting the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, that's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] was touching it, but I didn’t see Luke tapping it.
Moreno told SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I’m so sorry.”
PSV’s Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it won’t be long before it’s almost learned by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children’s book, he chose Dr. Seuss’ book The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was tricky, Cameron writes in a post posted on the SuperCamps website and continues: “It’s fun, touching, creative and has a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my kids because it always feels like there’s an image or message that we haven’t seen before.”
All of this is true, but the next chapter, in which Cameron presumably describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which new characters and details were added to the rather short original text.
"In the city of Tarville, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted hopes to win the girl of his dreams over to her heart by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the real tree," the text says and describes the love story that Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, actually named Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this isn't suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds in places like it's taken from the plot summary of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database, which begins with the following: "In the city of Tarville, inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even the air is merchandise, Ted boy hopes to win the heart of his dream Audrey girl."
Considering that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. In it, a young, nameless boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by a greedy, tree-cutting and weaving Kerskane, disregarding the story of the short, moustache-like creature Lorax, who "speaks for the trees."
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
The Prime Minister’s spokesman said the text was probably from Cameron’s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of being sidelined by the English team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what team England has chosen for the tour, I don’t think there’s any chance of a recurrence of the last 3-0 series loss.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win either.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the team from three years ago, but there are good twisters involved and the team’s mindset is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali develops in his spiral feeds, and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although he is an unknown player at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth Fallen from England Cricket Team, Replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged on their scores.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s choice before the announcement because, as I’ve said before, players are the best choice.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, there'll be a second chance.
England’s head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when he didn’t perform as well as he could, and that doesn’t surprise me.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter will have to leave a mark.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, as was Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play at home and away.
The only complaint is that England first chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming along, and there's a batsman I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something that we in Yorkshire saw early this season, when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same chance as the others before him, but of course this depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen has been balled in the pitch opening next to Cook, which would give us an extra pitcher, but we could keep four quick, and I am not against that.
I don't understand why a batsman can't hit there, and this left-handed guy has already proven himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen didn't necessarily do his job in Worcestershire, but he's their number three and there's not much difference.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games when the first one fell, before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari is going to be a substitute for the team and, with the little I’ve done with him, he feels like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unspoilt statistics - hitting the average of 31 with the ball at 35 - and think it's gambling, but there aren't too many pitchers on offer and the voters chose the young ones.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coaching side.
The nomination of Sri Lankan striker Mahaela Jayawardene as a game consultant may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game and brings a huge amount of experience, because he has done everything in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the white ball game, bringing both energy and a relentless glimpse.
I’ve always thought that he was born to be a part of international cricket, whether it’s playing or coaching, and he has the same exploitable wit as Mahalel.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly’s teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, was rested in a one-day session, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and electors do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made on light grounds.
Brexit supporters can win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron’s half-hearted renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing ever-greater problems every day, even without taking into account the heartfelt Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn’s election to lead the Labour Party or the trade union federation’s anger at Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Faragens.
A European diplomat recently explained that, because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of the British egocentric agenda, which is full of disagreeing concessions and disturbing treaty changes that these countries do not want for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the trade union federation decided that it did not want them either if they undermined social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, with or without the local eye-catcher, and then come home saying that they are winning supporters of reforms.
It's all about me.
A European friend of mine who wants to look outside the British EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', they say from Berlin - suggests that the short-sightedest ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care.
German cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before she ruins herself in the same way that happened to the long-lost Thatchers (11 years), Mitterrands (14) and Kohls (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande will be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He's a fading force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain may have a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the selfie brits, when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - they do not want that either because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even consciously plan to make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the UK 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"Renegotiations were arranged" and "Renegotiations had no meaning for Britain."
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-skeptical the press monarchs are, which they were not at the time of the 1975 Tony Benn-inspired referendum, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed at a ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the greatest European opportunist who made a name for himself by writing "EU Direct Bananas" when he was Brussels' correspondent in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of tax-avoiding gadgets, foreigners hacking phones, and people who are nominally resident elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually felt the same way about them, but realized that if you’re in a cage with a lusty gorilla, you’ll have to give up bananas for bluffing if you don’t want to be on that gorilla’s lunch list and later on for dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blairian than Blair himself when it comes to opposing Cameron's renegotiation tactic, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, thereby giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him.
But the kind Jeremy Corby, who kindly patted me on the back at the Westminster House on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of reintroducing Neil Kinnock's '80s boycott of Murdoch's strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
While it may take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not with me, but without a doubt with Andrew Marri, whose BBC couch Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says he would like us to remain in a renewed Europe.
Well, the majority of people outside of the UK Independence Party's war paint enthusiasm and the Conservative Party's fiercest nationalists can certainly stand by this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not a Benn fan" Benn said this on radio and television this week, when her internal scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint tough John McDonnell as the shadow government's finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father worked hard on television trying to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat in the government.
Hilary's efforts were more attractive.
But the struggle to keep up with “any situation” — Benn’s statement — was not what McDonnell said, nor, by all accounts, what Corbyn told the heads and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember, he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the age of 24/7 television, and especially in the social media vortex, which is a breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental spiral of EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spiritual regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult discussion among left-wing thinkers for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in doctrinal squabbles.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced Corby isn't campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely useless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the poor military performance of the British people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of Monday's British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England's e-cigarette rating
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency’s claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE published this “milestone” report last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of evidence.”
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial attacking the PHE’s main conclusion of “an exceptionally shaky bottom.”
Two other BMJ researchers have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness.”
They say the public expects PHE’s claim that “according to the current best estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes” is based on a detailed evaluation and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people, where a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinions on the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for an independent investigation.
He also supported the BAT’s public health mandate in the Sustainability Report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said they had received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was reported to have previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The selection criteria for the panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes a number of well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also report that they have received funding from the sector.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The PHE tobacco director also attended the meeting.
The study produced by the group “explicitly admits” that there is a lack of “undisputed evidence regarding the disadvantages of most products and the majority of criteria,” McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE’s claims that “there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes act as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE’s director of health and well-being, says the claims made in the BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says, “Electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
Half of those who smoked for life will die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence looks like and what it doesn’t look like, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - i.e. while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we fulfil our national responsibilities.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial rivals would "give anything" for hits such as this soap opera set on Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fees should only be used to make programs that other UK broadcasters do not.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, at difficult broadcast times against the most watched programmes of competitors and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said he was trying to establish a relationship with the BBC for six years, in vain.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC will produce and broadcast programs that would clearly suit unsubsidized competitors," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of its study of the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is retained - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this medium or, in the long run, it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice is being sent to the most important time of day, because we want to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded even without government subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, undeniably implemented inside the house.
Honestly, the other channels would do anything about it.
I don't understand how this is about public service broadcasting.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at all."
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who ran Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, said the BBC was guilty of spectator-hunting “because of the goals of the people who work there, and because they believe it’s the best way to achieve long-term support.”
He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC would sell shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said the BBC’s smaller public service programs “go to the BBC4, where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfills its responsibilities and can then hypocritically say, defending <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion in royalty revenues, ‘Of course, we’re doing all these unknown programs that no one is watching.’”
They'll put them in a mission location where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: “I challenge you to look for a more regressive system of who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is worth a lot of money, but I do not know if that is true for those people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money, because they do not spend much on the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its Reith mission of “informing, educating and entertaining.”
He said that only a small part of the BBC's production is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take the model of Australian and Canadian broadcasters and change the mission to "communicate, educate and entertain".
When it comes to partnership issues, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events like the Proms concerts, which, according to him, are only a few on television, and ally with commercial companies so that they can all be watched online.
"Sound genetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically engineered nervous systems to be controlled by sound wave bursts.
The tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically engineered motion neurons with ultrasound-reactive membrane channels.
Related: Scientists Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that worms show the functionality of a new method called sonic genetics. In it, ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure where electrical impulses are directed into people’s brains to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The nematodes do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles amplified the ultrasonic waves, which then travel inside the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, the structures that exist in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells attached to them, reports a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to manufacture ultrasonically controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that part of their motion neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani applied ultrasound to modified worms, the microbubbles amplified sound waves and transmitted them to the worms, where they switch on the modified motion neurons.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which has to be transmitted along the optical fiber to a desired location inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue unobstructed, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make the target human nerve cells momentarily respond to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to your home!
This is a disgrace to Britain’s arms trade.
Watch the video of Amnesty International.
Terrible killing machines!
Ankle-crushing leg restraints!
Grape bombs!
As well as electronic stun sticks that cause painful pain but leave no traces!
The joyful voice and the imagery of the comics leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest weapons fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British Government's willingness to sell arms to oppressive regimes at a party held at the ExCeL Centre of Defence and Security Equipment International in London's dockyard area.

As a result of the separate campaign, many posters appeared on bus stops and underground trains, which required more detailed study.
"Important information, Do you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" is asked together using the London Underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
This September, a pack of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... customers are asked to help stop the gun show.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were exhibited at Banksy’s Museum of Cruel Designs in Dismaland.
A collector called Special Patrol Group helped distribute the posters across London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a six-pound pack of hexagon keys that, according to the collector, "gets access to one-third of the advertising space on the entire planet's bus stops."
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized “poster vandalism.”
One of the parody advertisements produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists have begun to work with activists on the fronts of resistance when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to impact society.
Another anti-arms poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed over 100,000 times on Facebook in the last 24 hours. It was created free of charge by advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and background reporter also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director Matt Leverin found that there was no publicity for gun shows – and ExCeL’s calendar was empty at the time – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic advertisement for a shady corporation, but "it was more halting to emphasize the issue with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," said Tom Davies.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the fair comes from inside ExCeL, as exhibitors sell fantastically decorated products.
Saab revealed in a press release that it received an order from the U.S. Army for a "shoulder-launched AT4CS RS."
This includes a "unique tube-loading warhead that exerts excellent effects behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dormitory
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dormitory at the age of 19, when I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of the people I've been annoying - and the countless, long complaints of others.
Much of what I have learned can be summarized in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can be anything from nerve-wracking to completely scary.
It's tempting to talk: tell me where you're from, where you liked the middle year and what you think about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just yeast extract HAHAHA to find me in my room".
Take a breath.
And also help others to take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, not the ones you don’t want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they share fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights, and general entertainment venues, but they’re also places where people dress up and repair their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about starting college when you’re in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a room-to-room wandering culture that is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so that I can regain the energy I spent talking to you.”
Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of socializing - and maybe send a text instead of knocking on the door.
When I was talking about knocking, knocking.
A guy in my student residence thought that if the door wasn’t locked, he was invited in.
He's seen a lot of stuff.
Make friends through baking.
Since you’re starting college in the peak of the baking trend, knocking on people’s doors with a chocolate baking plate and introducing yourself seems somewhat less strange, less “welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions” for a 1950s student.
Providing self-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to talk, and may in the future associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, it depends on whether you know how to bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar fat lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, stealing a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission even if they boil inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to look at it more adult than my roommate who mixed detergent with her milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn’t make noise so that people can’t sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like the proverbial pot blaming the pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music quieter because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making her own music roar, locked her doors and took a three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or vice versa, wouldn’t it be incredibly embarrassing if you considered your dorm partner to be your future spouse, joined up, divorced, and then saw him every day and possibly lost all your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if your hot dorm partner isn’t really your future spouse, you could at least try to talk some sense into your bottom.
In that exhilarating moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranks and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but it can be canceled in no time.
You can teach a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something – but never mess up someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not attach their property with a blue sticker to the ceiling until at most twice.
Racist attack on accommodation of foreign students in Kitee - A house planned as a reception centre was smashed in Salo
A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students took place on Saturday morning in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, these are not accommodation for minor asylum seekers, but sleeping rooms for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time,” says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at Kitee’s Evangelical Folk High School.
The windows and walls of the accommodation facilities were smashed with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodation facilities, the police said.
According to Luukkanen, the responsible teacher of youth social guarantee education at the Folk High School, there were approximately ten people in the building that was targeted by vandalism at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and the adults are free to move, so some of them could have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
There are people of 12 different nationalities staying at the Folk High School.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the messed-up building has A-status.
Some of them study at an adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies, and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A-status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be issued for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland investigate the attack as an act of injuring and violating the peace of the home.
According to Luukkanen, a press conference was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic and no one wants to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened,” says Luukkainen.
He says the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected of being involved and were on the move in a light-colored car.
I think that this is the mood of the youth weekend evening, now that this topic has been on the surface.
"Nothing more serious," he said.
There is also a hospital in Salo where a reception centre is planned.
It happened last week.
MTV reported on its website on Tuesday.
On the wall of the hospital was a swastika drawn and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal report has been filed with the police.
Corrected incorrect information provided by the police about the age and status of the people living in the target building.
The government is shutting down the Y train to Karelia. The passengers are smashed, "it looks like an idiot."
The Y-train from Helsinki to Karjaa in Raasepori will stop running in March.
The news indignantly flew the passengers of the train at the Helsinki Central Station.
In particular, the downsizing will hit the people of Sion, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It’s completely idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and those working need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot depend on anything but political will - or lack of it.
Bengtström says in an interview video on HSTV that he will come to the capital with a tractor.
There are also train changes elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track will be merged into a new R line.
The Purola station in Järvenpää and the Nuppulinna station in Tuusula will not be used.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train services during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and there are routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will later be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Siuntioinen Bengtström considers that the state train cutter is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes remorse.
The Y train is also used by non-Rasepori and Siuntio people because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was displeased by the fate of those travelling further away from the city area by train.
"It's especially miserable for those who have to re-plan their journey," he said, hurting on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train connection to the coastline is likely to replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. it will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This increases the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to examine the different options and their impact on the service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, President and CEO of HSL.
It is not yet possible to estimate the cost accurately.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately one million a year for the Y-train, of course the Ministry has paid much more than this.
The R-line on the main track misses two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, however, the number of train services will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will be closed throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer purchase train services on the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki routes.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train services will be reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips are made on the discontinued services each year, while the total number of trips in the transport purchased by the Ministry is approximately nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the state a savings of 12.3 million per year.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital’s topicality: “It’s worth getting acquainted with Marx”
Crises in the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, who is known as the former chairman of the SKP, in the book The topicality of Marx’s Capital published today.
"He is being taken more seriously now than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx’s assessments of the development of the capitalist economy, its internationalization and penetration into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital, have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
The authors list of the book, based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakane, also includes Aalto University professor Sixten Korkman, a respected financial expert.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is topical “now and forever.”
However, the former CEO of the Finnish Institute of Economic Research and the Finnish Business delegation is not a Marxist, is it?
Oh, my God.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not see Marx as a contemporary economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary expert.
"The usual idea is that ideology tells the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s predictions went terribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman speculates.
But Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth, are now again being discussed.
"Marx may be able to inspire someone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of a technological revolution," Korkman said.
But what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx will not help.
He believed that capitalism was a hopeless affair that should be stopped.
Marx, however, is worth getting acquainted with.
"In the 1970s, Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
“Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but more so each other.”
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burden of the past.
"Every social scientist should get acquainted with Marx's mind-set - as with other classics," Korkman says.
U.N. calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for a special tribunal to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan civil war, AFP reports.
The UN report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 was published on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as the Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people have died in the Sri Lankan civil war.
The exact number of victims is not known.
In particular, a major military attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be thoroughly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The report accuses the Sri Lankan armed forces of torture, kidnappings and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely to be men as women.
According to the report, the rebels were guilty of forcing bystanders and children into fighting.
Both sides are reported to have committed murders.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
English yo-yo test allowed to weigh social media
On Wednesday, the autumn graduation writings had a long foreign language, the majority of which was English.
More than 16,000 candidates tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a subject from social media, for example.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, 150-250 words of writing could be directed to the web magazine’s counsellor.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelia lounge chair.
He asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things from the point of view of young people as well.
There were four subjects in total, of which one had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them," Mia Lybeck, an English lecturer at the Swedish-speaking upper secondary school in Porvoo, said.
The third issue was simply a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic, according to Lybeck, was quite nice.
It was supposed to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we've been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says, evaluating the whole experiment as "fairly normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test was able to answer questions about texts that discussed, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the processing of large amounts of data.
Some lengthy Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn writings will continue on Friday, when the second home country, i.e. Swedish or Finnish, will take the test.
In upper secondary schools, the exam is arranged as usual, so the employees’ protests do not affect it.
The matriculation examination committee advises candidates to find suitable transport connections in time so that they can get to the probationary session.
You can also get extra time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
Shop was robbed in Oulu with gun threat
On Wednesday morning, a shop was robbed in Oulu.
According to police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commando beanie covering his face.
He has a normal body and is about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and had received a small sum of money.
This is being investigated as a robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
A protest against the government’s cuts will block downtown Helsinki on Friday, the police predict.
According to preliminary information, tens of thousands of people may arrive.
Members of the Associations of SAK, Akava and STTK will meet at Rautatientori at 11 a.m.
Police are also expected to participate in the demonstration.
The task of the police officers at work is not only to carry out the alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the flow of the giant demonstration.
Roads leading to the railway station will be closed to motor vehicles between 9.30 and 14.00.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From Hakaniemi direction, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, starting from Mannerheimintie in the west direction.
Will the Helsinki Police Department have enough people, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it seems enough.
I don't take a stand on the police business.
According to Kujala, support patrols from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the protest.
The exact number of patrols the police won't tell us.
"There's going to be a lot coming, but mostly we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
Police are warning against driving a private car in Helsinki city centre on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic rush extends from the Hakaniemi level to the centre of the city.
Standing traffic can be expected from morning until early in the morning.
With demonstrators coming from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed in the railway station.
The buses are, in principle, quite far away.
The rest of the way must then be to walk to the demonstration site,” Kujala says.
The demonstration will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of the fluency of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, will now be dealt with in part by itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may arrive in Helsinki.
Police are waiting for the demonstration to go smoothly.
After all, the people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finns are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also take place across Finland on Friday.
Friday’s demonstration is exceptional in many ways – do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is not a very good comparison point in Finnish political history, says emeritus Martti Siisäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the U.S. is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government, Siisikainen says.
The very right-wing government has attacked the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard-core approach to contract law is lacking.
There are a lot of signs that the union movement is really trying to get to its knees.
At the same time, the ay-movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
Mirrors are needed, for example, because the trade union movement does not have the support of all wage earners for Friday’s demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about in the crowd that the union movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland protested at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday’s demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorstai, held in 1993, Siisäinen says.
In the midst of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed people.
The government of Esko Aho (Central) stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that never before had the relationship between the Finnish government and the workers’ organisations been as bad as under the bourgeois government of Aho.
Now the relationship between the government and the union movement is perhaps even worse than it was at the time of Murros Thursday.
Besides, Finland's most bourgeois government ever is now in power, Siisäinen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in the sense that it is so rigidly right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
There were still certain elements of the old working-class movement.
Thousands of protesters are expected on Friday.
The protest will also stop public transport and possibly close daycare centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of employees, it can become the largest for years to come.
In recent years, around 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the protests of the Finnish trade union movement have been quite peaceful - although the methods of action have become more and more difficult in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict, be law-abiding.
Demonstrators try to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisikainen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The protest culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs, and police prepared to get pig shit on their heads.
The firefighters’ strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also strikes for pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970s metal and electricity strikes
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the strike.
The strike was suspended at the request of the conciliation committee after seven weeks of strike.
The metal men got a 16% pay rise.
The 1977 electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused blackouts across the country.
Tornado in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people, many of whom were made redundant by the recession, gathered in front of the House of Representatives to protest for work.
Firefighters on strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strikes of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, farmers protested against the EU, and the police were forced into egg rain.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
The farmers were tons of snow.
The EU summit in Helsinki in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995.
The nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they went on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a number of deaths.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass dismissal of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass dismissal eventually spurred the negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors on Strike in 2001
"Doctors Strike - Forced," was the slogan of the strikers in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted about five months and sparked a lively debate on how the strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector increased the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched from Senate Square in Helsinki to the Parliament Building in 2013.
Central Crime Police investigates the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees for the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Crime Police for help in clarifying the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees in Aisterheim, near the German border.
It is not known whether the truck was on its way to Finland.
Everyone in the cold truck was in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility is at the scene of the incident in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in Austria by truck were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died of suffocation.
According to Yleisradio, which first reported on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company operates, among other things, restaurant operations and its CEO is a man with a foreign background, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for smuggling human beings.
A fugitive-beating captain, a former drug courier, and a wealthy businessman - the story of five smugglers
A rich king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, are involved in human smuggling into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers," and their book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they introduce the tentacles of human smuggling, present solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm going to beat them right away.
Kerkenna islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for a summer holiday.
Due to its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, with the Italian island of Lampedusa only 120 kilometres away.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more lucrative for a fisherman to transport people.
Emir has done this on his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
After expenses, Emir earns about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000 per trip.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis flared up again.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is provided in such a way that customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 per night, and if you run out of money, that’s their problem.
We go out at midnight with the lanterns turned off.
On the first night we drive away from the islands, then we stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in the 20-meter-high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour, and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims he's beating the hangmen to death.
In the book, he tells us that when he was once beaten up by the police, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed the customers one by one and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear he's got his countrymen to beat him up about this.
I'm going to beat them right away.
They need to be shown who's in charge right away.
Just an ordinary taxi driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good -- the starter engine's on its last beat, and anyway, it's seen its best days.
For Goran’s customers, however, the most important thing is that the taxi moves at all and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a is a small village with 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
There is a centre for asylum seekers next to the village, where families are mainly admitted.
In the forests surrounding the city centre, men who travel without their families are accommodated in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds the majority of its customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a area, a major hub for human smuggling, people are tired of death.
The Goran people are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are the Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say it once and that's enough," Goran praises.
He says the Africans are trying to compromise.
That's not what Goran likes.
A fool's a fool all the way.
For example, they first agree on a price of 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I’m just doing my job and helping people,” he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about 300 km, most of it by a comfortable motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has banned taxis from transporting migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his ride a mile from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and sways away.
In the Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese is called a missionary, and it’s not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where a large number of Congolese refugees are visited, as well as a small centre for Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business in which people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It is important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of the white underwear glares elegantly beneath the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he arranges people from Congo to Uganda and then to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money carefully and swoop in among the traffickers crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be told that they are from war zones such as North Kivu and that they have been forced to flee violence from their homes.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Missionary will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old ID will be discarded and replaced with another.
The missionary's contacts with the Ugandan police will help.
The client is then redirected to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, NGOs, and finally the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He bills for each staircase separately: filing an application with the Ugandan police costs around 100 euros, handling documents for a humanitarian organisation around 150 euros, and moving to a European country, for example, costs between 4,500 and 7,000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on duty off the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, a French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the center of Calais.
They're driving down the A26 and trying to evade the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want, he's been sitting on drugs for seven years.
A taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom's gonna pick the right truck, make sure it's on its way to England, not the Netherlands, and cut the safety wire to the tarpaulin.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, the same kind that is wrapped around a frying pan or oven potato in the kitchen.
It's supposed to keep the police heat scanner from spotting the person hiding.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene hoping that the driver will not be able to catch a smuggler, at least not before the UK.
The King of Smugglers
Muammar Kü<0xC3><0xA7>ük is one of the world’s most famous smugglers of human beings.
The immersive Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal Mediterranean landings, who manages maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Kü<0xC3><0xA7>ük has been operating since the 1990s and is constantly developing new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he arrives.
One of the new methods is the luxury craft scam: Turkish ports rent yachts to allegedly take American or European families on nice tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships are being loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported for between EUR 5 000 and EUR 7 000, first by land from Istanbul to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are being crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.

American Olympic runner talks about her illness and becoming a prostitute
Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book, Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine released a copy of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in top condition and ran the second best time in the qualifiers.
In the final, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leading position with a manic run.
150 yards before the goal, however, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line," says Favor Hamilton in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but was fascinated by the idea of getting paid to have sex with strangers.
She also persuaded her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's price was <0x24>450 an hour.
He said he spent the money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he needed the same adrenaline surge he had received in his athletics competition.
Favor Hamilton later found out that he had a bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012 when the magazine Smoking Gun published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton competed in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world statistician at 3.57.40, but was the last in the Sydney Olympics.
World Champion delighted when alliance puts Norway’s ski blossom under control: “Straight-backed”
Norwegian skiing king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of suitability, according to at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have twisted the whole summer and autumn into a sports contract, as they did last year.
While the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the alliance had put the ski blossom under control.
"Thank you for pointing the spine," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the association," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently wants to be part of the national team for the season so he can promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was delighted to represent an alliance that also cares for future generations, rather than letting one athlete go solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance had granted Northugi financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just being the best.
On Tuesday, Northug released his own statement, in which he stated that he would like to play in the Norwegian colours next season at the World Cup, as well as at the World Cup and the Olympic Games thereafter.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Cup medals, including two gold medals.
He was on the team that won the gold medal in Falun last winter.
Frying Translators’ Shield Day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On the Day of the Shield, 25 September, there will be sprints in various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Baking Translators’ Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-quality food industry know-how and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant, as well as to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, the aim is to remind that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki metropolitan area, but that there are top restaurants that are inspected and classified by an independent operator all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event demonstrates the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is organized in Vaasa restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, a restaurant from the Old Town participates in the shield day.
The event has also attracted considerable attention internationally.
It is therefore decided to make the event one of the most important international events of the organisation, which will take place on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: Complaint to Chancellor of Justice about the establishment of Kauhava Reception Centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are collaborating to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhava convoy, which is currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure is still permanently located in the region during the crisis period, which is at the disposal of the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkkot Oy.
According to Kauhajoki magazine, according to a private individual, placing a reception centre in the same building complex would constitute a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Aviation School, the impact of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
In the case of Kauhava Airport, negotiations have been held over the past two years on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator to the airport.
The matter has been discussed, for example, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint does not concern a fundamental objection to the reception centre, but that the planned location in the former garrison area is wrong.
The City Council of Kauhava dealt with the detention centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at their office in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, the concern about managing the refugee situation brought all participants together.
He appreciates the fact that in Finland the government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges.
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
He is very hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. if the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the continuing tensions in the Baltic Sea.
The issue of NATO was also discussed.
The President did not take a position on the labour market.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia says that the operations of airports will be managed by supervisors during work stoppages.
However, congestion and delays are expected in security checks and other service points.
Protests close the streets of Helsinki city centre
The demonstration on Friday closes the streets of central Helsinki.
The police say that the streets leading to Railway Square will be closed from cars at around 9.30 a.m. to 14.00 p.m.
From Mannerheimintie direction, cars are not allowed on Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu towards the railway station.
From Unioninkatu to Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to police, the closing time depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers at all Friday’s demonstration
Metro and tram drivers will participate in Friday’s demonstration from the beginning of morning to the end of night traffic.
The tram and subway personnel association told STT about this last night.
The majority of Alko will close for two hours, including post offices closed
Friday’s protest will also cause disruption to Posti’s services.
Significant delays are expected, for example, in the delivery of daily mail.
Most of the post offices are closed.
The blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross are carried out despite the strike.
Meal transports, hospital shipments and laboratory samples are also handled.
Information on services can be found on Posti’s website.
Most of Finland’s Alko will close its doors on Friday for two hours.
The service trade union Pam has instructed its employees to stop work between 11am and 1pm.
Pam has also called on grocery workers to take part in the trade union demonstration.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko will tell Helsingin Sanomat that they will try to keep the stores open with the help of supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is still no information on the possible closure of individual stores.
Helsinki kindergartens partially closed
The daycare centres in Helsinki are not fully operational on Friday, reports the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Department.
Due to the demonstrations of trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres and club activities in day care centres and playgrounds will not be organised.
24-hour daycare centres and groups of mentally and multi-disabled children remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of schoolchildren with intellectual disabilities and autism are organised normally.
The Finnish Early Childhood Education Authority promises to announce further changes tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, there is a need for versatile channels for communication, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches will become a recurring habit.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle’s channels in the future.
If other channels are registered as channels, we'll see.
Tonight, this channel is being used, he said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires giving a television and radio address to the citizens.
This dossier, which we are talking about here, is rather complex and requires a longer justification.
That’s why we ended up on this channel,” Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in the arena.
He takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech will not tell about the more general introversion of the government.
Is there an attempt to take the right to define public debate more strictly into their own hands and to refuse the questioning of public debate?, says Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
It reminds me of a recent comment by Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that there is no link between these two issues.
I understand that the commercial media is indignant at the announcement.
It would be strange if the media did not respond.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not a matter of announcement in a democracy.
The role of media representatives is, by definition, to ensure that the agendas of politicians are not taken as given.
According to Koivus, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
Sipilä’s speech should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Will there be more of what we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is just more of the same old, one has to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Even Ylek takes a risk in this sense, if it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as a media outlet for politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in Yle’s interests or general policy.
A cunning bet from Sipilä
In Sipilä’s forthcoming speech, what the Prime Minister is not saying is also important, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, one should look carefully at where Sipilä is missing and where he is not,” says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuutti, the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipilä, because this way he can express his own view without gravel sounds.
This will bring the message to the general public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
He ignores the media and speaks directly to the people.
There is a danger, however, that the media will misinterpret the speech because more specific questions will not be asked.
According to Kuutti, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - does the sweat run out, do the hands tremble.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure, who now tells the people what to do.
If you know how to put things right, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform you about something, because here, as it were, a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what (US President Barack) Obama and his partners regularly practice.
Really Exceptional
Erkka Railo, a political scientist, considers the Prime Minister’s speech to the citizens to be truly exceptional.
He said it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister has spoken directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher thinks that the Prime Minister wants to make Finns sympathetic to the extortions that lie ahead.
Workers’ organisations will hold a demonstration and strikes on Friday against the government’s actions.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, in which case the speech would also be discussed.
The chairman of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), again announces that he is challenging Sipilä’s dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Soon, six months after the election.
You can’t hide forever,” Rinne wrote on Twitter.
9-year-old boy found in Tampere
The boy was fine when he was found.
The boy has been found and is in good shape, the boy’s father updated his Facebook page.
The local police also confirms this to the local police.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later that night, he was no longer contacted.
Father thanked all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed more than 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
Finnish UFC star disappointed in violent seduction of young people: You create hatred
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish free fighter, posted a video on Facebook that specifically appeals to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a pressing speech against the street fights of young people.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has so far won both professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani said he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account in which young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhan says he's disappointed in the young people's seduction.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the people on the ground, sit on top of the other one and punch me in the face without thinking about any of the consequences of this when you make videos like this," Amirkhani said.
Difficult to justify
Some of the young people shown in the videos are from an immigrant background.
According to Inspector Jarmo Heinonen of the Helsinki Police Department, the fight videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and native Finnish young people.
It's the fact that you guys are fighting on the street at all.
You make life more difficult for so many other immigrants here in Finland, says Amirkhani from Turku.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite outrageous.
It's a little hard, boys, no longer to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests here for quite a long time.
That’s a slightly different way of thanking you for being here,” says Amirkhan.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the target of racism, you have to blame yourself.
Think about it a couple of times before you get involved in something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violence is a source of racism.
You create a kind of hatred that I don’t like either.
You're doing pretty bad things anyway, and you're not going to improve them at all, my Amirkhan decides.
SAK pledges its position on the austerity package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, chairman of SAK, said on Twitter that on Monday the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
STTK, an employee centre organisation, announced earlier Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the Government, which would achieve the 5% productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Chairman of Akava Sture Fjäder believes that the Board will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require SAK, the largest employee organisation, to soften its previous stance.
Chairman of SAK Lauri Lyly commented on the matter narrowly on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that instead of coercive laws, agreements between active parties are needed.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä’s Government’s proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
Sipilä earlier cut off the negotiations on the social contract when SAK refused to commit to the five per cent productivity leap target.
Comment: The big protest threatens to fade - "It feels a bit funny to shake a fist"
After all, it feels a bit funny to make a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere in the employee camp varies from one side to the other.
Do you want to overthrow the government, or do you want to make a deal with it?
On Monday, SAK’s federal leaders swept out holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
All of Finland was threatened with being shut down.
The threat spread to the avatars.
The teachers’ union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ canceled: no schools or kindergartens will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), chairman of the STTK, presented a conciliatory presentation.
He said that he had contacted the government and was preparing an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity leap, as demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
Akava’s chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok), hurried to announce that his settlement paper was already ready.
At first, there was no sound from the SAK office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) has a hard time reaching an agreement when federal leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand up on Friday.
Eventually, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would be looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to produce a joint proposal by employees, SAK should be willing to accept a five per cent productivity leap as a target.
No wonder Palolan STTK has good relations with Sipilä’s government.
Palola’s right-hand man, Jukka Ihanus, STTK’s director of social influence, was formerly the special assistant of the central prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola said that the government’s business expertise has continuously improved.
Coincidence or not, but Palola’s output took a bit of energy away from Finland’s standstillists, whose front image is AKT’s Marko Piirainen (sd).
After all, it feels a bit funny to put a fist down if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6 p.m.: Added information on Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland ‘bad host’: ‘This must not happen again’
President of the Russian Duma Sergei Naryshkin criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Russian Duma President Sergei Naryshkin says Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, at which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the jubilee meeting held in Helsinki in July.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians on the European Union’s sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to attend the meeting – something the President reminded journalists of.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin said, according to Interfax.
Naryshkin’s criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where he was also denied entry.
The sanctions are political suicides from the EU, Naryshkin said.
The Russian delegation reached Mongolia without difficulty, so Naryshkin continued to praise and thank Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the one that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), who is leading the meeting in Ulan Bator, and according to Russian media has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Goals tight"
Tappara and Lukko continue their bull days in Hakametsä today, when both are on fire on the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no actual goal parties in Hakametsä today.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to dig for a 3-2 time win from KalPa.
The rise was masculine, as last season’s silver team was at its worst on the losing position of two goals.
Tuesday was more cheesy.
The guests of the Blues, who had started the catch of the Rauma people, were round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals are tight, if any of them are playing the same game as last year, Janne Lahti, a Lock attacker, predicts the set-ups on the club’s website.
It has become a playoff nightmare for the people of Rauma.
In the previous two seasons, Tappara has been in the semi-finals just from the final series of the Lock.
In both cases, a decisive seventh match was required.
In the fourth game of the season, Lukko broke the series, but in the next three games, Tappara rose to the side and passed.
With the exception of goalkeepers, there are no major changes in the composition of the groups.
Both of the cashiers who were rejected yesterday will be on flute duty today.
With Tappara’s goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski between the lock posts.
Point of View: A lousy play in the ace
Sports director Toivola wrote an unsuitable sequel to head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone co-wrote the film Rocky, in which he himself starred.
The underdog sensationally campaigned for heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky’s premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
An unnamed and wooden-handed patapakka progressed to the SM-finals in 2006 to everyone's surprise.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There were White Indians, Pori Matti and Pele Pelto.
In the fall games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
Toivola became a blonde.
The great TV reporter JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
The Aces took the silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that this season’s novel works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as the sports director of the Aces has built a patapaka on the basis of bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been smashing guys in a trough like Rocky pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen lie somewhere other than in the game.
Toivola has forgotten that the main character in Rocky VI is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has christened Iron Rock as Sean Connery.
In Rocky, written by Toivola, Rautakallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's nothing Rocky in Iron Rock but a nickname.
Iron Rock's philosophy of playing does not include rushing and little squirrels.
He appreciates hard play, but it’s one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of Assien tackled Killer Jere Karjalainen in the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I do not approve of such a game and it does not belong to the ace hockey, Rautakallio got excited after the game for the people of Satakunta.
This year’s team is strangely built.
There's juveniles, veterans, cops, cops.
There are practically no key players in the best game age.
It's no wonder the head coach has complained about a lack of skills.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season have an impact on procurement and unfortunately the market situation was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's beneath the surface.
The 1953 Iron Rock is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola’s place as a sports boss.
Men’s contracts will end in the spring.
The Aces’ balance in the three league matches of the season is equal to the number of losses with a 1–6.
Hope should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays the mother of Sipe Santapukki
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would not have had anything in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing the mother of my husband's friend in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanta’s former bassist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has worked together a lot before, but now Olga plays for the first time under the guidance of Tuukka.
Olga’s role in the film You made us beautiful is played by Sipe Santapukki’s mother Sirkka.
Sirkka cheers and supports his son, although his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my true role model Sirkka, the easier it seems to be for me to play the role.
He’s a great guy and I’m grateful to Tuuka for trusting the role to me.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have become much closer.
They've met, they've spoken on the phone, they've been messaging.
The circus has helped a lot.
We've gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
Luckily, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a bit.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the 90's, it was a recession, and it was really troubling.
There was a small chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about her youth even before her film plans.
Sometimes the stories of my parents are a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, then how much parents really know what you're doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuukka, known as Heinola’s infamous skater.
Olga was an ordinary and kind girl who had nothing to do with the film Tuukka.
At most, she could have secretly fallen in love with him.
According to Olga, he has collaborated so much with Tuukka over the past 10 years that he is not afraid of a big joint project.
Everything has always been super good.
Now the entire production team is going to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Iitti often intends to drive home for the sake of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, asking only what streets and when they will be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 Is the Most Expensive Film in Finland
The film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million.
Filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to Iron Sky: The Coming Race will be Finland’s most expensive drama film of all time with a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million.
Previously, the title of Finland’s most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The Angry Birds animated film will also be released in Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Filming of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, starts in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
The budget is not scary.
I've been so relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what kind of movie should be.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It’s great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited, and I can’t wait to show this movie to the audience,” she tells Iltalehti.
Originally, the film had a budget of <0x24>8-10 million, but as the script evolved, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
However, the film would be worth <0x24>100 million because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything has been twisted so tight that there is no looseness.
The film’s production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond that pays an annual interest rate of between 4% and 8%.
The final interest rate will be determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junkie or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendseters’ fronts have recently been decorated with large logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like no Crocs ever did.
Advertising a hoodie or a t-shirt brand was seen as something of a jerk.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a true fashion megatrend, and old, well-known sportswear brands like Adidas and Nike have also risen to the brim of coolness.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already a jerk, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the trendy fashion, in which the trend setters surprised me by preferring as boring basic clothes as possible as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Now, instead of the grey basic college, we’re going to put on the sweatshirt that’s already buried at the bottom of the cabinet, with the manufacturer’s logo on the front.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas’ recognisable stripe sweaters, favorite team shirts and New York Yankees caps have made a comeback in street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos on the shorts are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, Versace’s autumn blouses make it clear which brand the garment is.
Are you ready to show off the logos in your dress?
Russian politician reveals evidence: I didn’t get stuck in a tank hatch for hours!
The incident was alleged to have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held.
In recent days, the Russian media has been circulating colourful allegations that the Russian emergency ministry was forced to disconnect the large-scale Zotov from the tank lock for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even posted a photo on his own public Facebook page where he appears to be peeking through the hatch of the armored vehicle in a pretty good mood and, at least, based on the photos, it’s not about getting stuck or getting angry.
It's all nonsense.
Let’s start with the fact that I didn’t enter the battle tank, but it was an attack tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier, a lieutenant colonel, I've served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace,” Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
“I didn’t get stuck and I certainly didn’t spend five hours in that position,” he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian military television channel that he admired Russia’s new technology at the show because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That’s why I was interested in what’s inside the wagon, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went in, and I came out.
"I'm tall and strong, but nothing like being stuck somewhere in a tank happened," he told Radio Russkaya sluzhba novostei.
Zotov’s statement is supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged stall have been published, despite the fact that a total of 50,000 people visited the gun show in just a few days.
The allegation that Zotov was trapped originated in a case on Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was reported to have swooped out of the hatch while trying to get out and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn’t get out of the way.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story, in which the organizers of the exhibition shared their views on what had happened.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours,” said Alexander Pisarevsky, the exhibition’s coordinator, to Bloknot.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilä mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand pool into the ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been started.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
In general, the water is either pumped for reuse as process water or, according to the permit, discharged through the surface drainage field into the environment.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection on Monday morning.
The leakage has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the basin.
The company says it will work closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against excessive cuts
The country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to undertake comprehensive structural reforms in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime compensation and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms are needed for the entire system of contracts and unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF’s assessment contains a lot of sympathetic messages to the government’s actions, but on the other hand, there are also warning words about what should not be cut too much.
Such are, for example, infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki to Taloussanomi.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects growth of 0.4% for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
In its new economic forecast, Danske predicts that growth will remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been based on the latest findings.
This morning Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
Weakened confidence in industry or other so-called softer indicators may have received less attention.
However, the differences are only a few decimal places.
Nintendo has appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked for Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata’s footsteps, says Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research.
Kimishima's mission is to take Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but not to eat the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children are missing every year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, hundreds of minors are missing in Sweden every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Chief Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many of the applicants disappear "underground" per year? - In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications were made in Finland for unaccompanied minors.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were submitted and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that the case reveals that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and that he or she may have been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were lapsed because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last year, he says.
Is the number increasing?
As of 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from unaccompanied minors.
There are still no comprehensive statistics on the number of missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of minor asylum seekers is known and has increased significantly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he emphasises.
What about those who have been prosecuted?
Are they also disappearing into the ‘black labour market’, for example?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the enforcement of decisions on deportation, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered asylum seekers.
He has taken action on this.
Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the EU Interior Ministers’ meeting, told on Monday about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see photos of the devices
The equipment used for TV and radio productions by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a pioneer in the media sector who has lost his ability to work due to seizures, is now available for sale.
Mikkonen’s wife Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional equipment in her field.
The online advertisement was first reported by the online magazine Iltamakasiini.
Nowadays, a large part of the equipment has been caught up in technological development.
In the digital media world, there are no longer television programs for Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen, however, is confident that there will be interested ones.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these are also needed as long as there is old generation material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks for IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from their current Myrskylän home.
We can't take all the stuff with us.
I’ve started to look at things and see what they’re giving up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use of radio and television equipment.
It is clear from recent strokes that a man with a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life’s work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up a bunch of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to break even worse than thought: Metro and trams may stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers today will decide whether to extend the force in connection with Friday’s demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the time of the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Pekka Hirvonen, the Chief Trustee, says that the uo is big on the field.
The cuts in night and shift allowances are seriously hurting drivers, so the government's plans to cut the allowances are reluctant.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic for the whole day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Friday, public transport in the Helsinki metropolitan area is almost completely stopped.
According to VR, the trains do not run on Friday between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.
There will be no local or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains departing before 6 a.m. will be driven to the destination stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses will remain in depots.
AKT members are absent from work on Friday from 3:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Saturday morning.
Most likely, a small number of buses can be driven, they will be driven by superior forces, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says that HSL is not able to say exactly which bus lines will run on Friday.
Employee organisations will organise a large demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move on to Europe, according to the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have attempted to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
Muslim Boy Arrested at Texas School After Teacher Thinks His Homemade Clock Is a Bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a schoolteacher described his watch as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to show off the output of his electronics hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the watch looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohammed has never claimed anything other than that he had made the clock.
Yet there is still a possibility that the boy may be accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police said the watch looked like a "film bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it is said to have consisted of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohammed was sentenced to three days of compulsory school leave.
His father is furious about the incident, and the US-Islamic Council is wondering if the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain's Labour Leader Refuses to Sing National Anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
Corbyn's own Labour Party MPs have also joined the criticism of the right-wing press.
This has offended the people, said Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's commemoration commemorated the fight of British air force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In an official statement, the Labour Party defended Corbyn and stressed that he had paid tribute to the pilots by attending the event.
We are all indebted to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement stressed.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided labour's ranks.
Particularly among parliamentarians there are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity measures and increasing public spending.
Mr Corbyn is due to appear in Parliament for the first time today as party leader during Question Time with the Prime Minister.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted this weekend about Corbyn’s election as party leader.
“The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families,” the prime minister tweeted.
The cause of the Minnesota family death is still unclear - the family's father was awaited in a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10, and a few days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
On the basis of this report, the police went to the house for a check-up and found Short’s family dead across the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A millionaire and a successful company
The case of South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Siitar is still under investigation.
The motive for the blood is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In an interview with StarTribune in 2014, Short said the site had four million different visitors per week.
I've had 50 bids from the company in the last ten years.
I have abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
In 2011, Short’s family bought a fabulous house in Greenwood for <0x24>2 million.
The house is advertised on the property site Zillow as a car collector’s dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Litigation pending
StarTribune said the family's father was facing a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers various prep courses, had sued him for commenting on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, the comments defamatory of the preparation courses had not been removed from Short’s website and had therefore lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short’s business.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee

This is great, Loiri commented cheerfully on her honorary board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by the success of Fabrice Duo in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
Success horse coach Korpi gets full peace of mind with Loiri while working with the horse.
Pekka decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri laughed.
A stunning gesture from an NHL star - "The greatest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated <0x24>10 million to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the hospital, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to a charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban signed a <0x24>72 million contract with the Canadiens for eight years.
Subban’s donation is significantly higher than his <0x24>9 million annual income.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a hall space in the hospital.
Canadiens players have previously made significant contributions to local hospitals.
A year ago, longtime captain Jean Beliveau, who died, raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum of money for another major hospital in the city to get a PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order a wife from the Japanese cafe for the evening - only the bikini and the apron are served.
The theme cafes are a big deal in Japan.
There is already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a halibut cafe and now a wife cafe on the market.
It strikes the lonely, the solitary, the hungry.
This is reported by Metro.
You can order a wife or a husband for the evening at Ore no Yome (my wife) in Tokyo.
This is a waitress who pretends to be a client’s spouse.
The "spouse" is selected from the list before entering the cafe and he or she prepares and serves the food.

Soon 150 million vehicles connected to the network: Prepared for attacks against car security
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, Intel said in a statement.
The board is made up of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and audits to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of best cybersecurity practices.
In the future, the company will update the report based on the ASRB’s findings.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles in circulation will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimates, 60-75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing web-based data.
“We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Chris Young, head of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best practices in terms of security and support the view that cybersecurity is a key component in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>52,000 in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been waiting for years as the moon rises.
Finally, the car is in sight in Finland.
Ford has announced the RS as the car’s eyes are on the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford’s new all-wheel-drive RS accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.7 seconds with a 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine and a top speed of 266 km/h.
The price is also interesting from the Finnish point of view, it is said to be 52,000 euros.
The car is now available to order, although Ford does not say when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
Kia presents two new products at the Frankfurt Motor Show – the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, the most important of the two novelties is the new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to capture a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
The Sportage, created in the shape of a new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, is more round than before.
The wheelbase and the outer dimensions have been increased by one inch and the car splits the air more efficiently.
The engine range remains broadly unchanged, with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbo engine with 177 horsepower.
More information about the Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption is available closer to the launch.
We’ll have to wait a little longer, because we’ll have a new Sportage in spring 2016.
Before the end of the year, the new Kia Optimat arrived in Finland.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a completely new car.
Kia intends to capture the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with improved driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher-quality equipment.
The Optimos are equipped with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will pick up when the Optima GT with its 2.0-litre turbo engine comes alongside them.
At the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu back on stage in a bold jumpsuit
Singer Chisu participates in the Life for a Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue trousers have a striking, open neckline.
The costume presents beautifully the graceful waist of the singer-star.
The collection is crowned with a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the singer, who became a mother, has managed to shed the pounds of pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be one year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Getting back on stage and in front of the public after a long break doesn’t really make me nervous.
I miss everything about music, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release a new album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired me to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu wonders.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is amazing again - now you can see the breast
Reality-TV-beauty Kim Kardashian talks one after another.
She presents her pregnancy belly and breasts generously in sexy clothes, last night at 1:00 p.m. when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left Kanye West's gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent on the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress when the flashlights flash.
Last time Kardashian wore amazon-like maternity suit, she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was accentuated by black overknee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when my pregnancy belly was on the show.
Tough Laws of the Model World: No Home, You're Lonely, Competition is Terrible
The top model, Manon Leloup, wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk about the model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine collected Leloupi's six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if you were posing in top designer outfits last season, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry, competing for work with their rivals.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is a constant journey, and it can take up to one year to accommodate a hotel room or an apartment in which fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There is not just one type of weight loss.
An agent in New York might ask you to lose pounds, but in Paris they'll say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a risky game.
At Fashion Weeks, models and designers are together all the time, and at the same time they act as a support network.
When the fashion week is over, the difference is bleak.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are bothered by the fact that everyone thinks work is just a show of clothes.
Models also want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors who have a role to play.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
You modeled yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating Fashion Weeks, where designers unveil their collections for next year.
Scrooge Salminen plays the most unknown musician in the film
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, the band’s founding member, in a film based on the early years of Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanta in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is quite a challenge for me, because I’m going to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I’m going to play a 16-year-old guitarist,” Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Ant before the filming because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unfamiliar to people from that group, so I think it's a good thing that I just learn his playing style from video.
I don't want to imitate a human being.
A man who runs the band Scrooge Salminen and Dogs completely empty is not going to play the role.
Punk-maniers come naturally, according to man.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I'm sure a lot of people saw a taste, as well as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been small, but we always go in full swing.
The main actors of the film You made us beautiful, directed by Tuukka Temos, who played bass in Apulanta in 1993-2004, were announced today.
The core group of the band, which has become familiar to the public, is performed by young actors who are still quite unknown to the public.
The drummer Sipe Santapukki is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a hint about his future job last night, when he told Snapchat that he was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already posted a photo of her new look on Instagram yesterday, which she has had to do for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in the moustache and jawbone, has shaved his face into a shave and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist: How to Tell Kids About Refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to come to Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the issue, says Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR’s crisis team.
Younger children should be protected and not, for example, allowed to watch the news alone.
Young children may not always be able to understand what they are seeing, and it can stay in the mind and be distressing, she says.
However, if a child has come across TV news footage of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to have a conversation about the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what they are asking.
Your child’s fears can be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
You shouldn’t scare your child in vain, even if you feel anxious and scared.
The younger child closely monitors the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe.
Older children are likely to encounter conversations about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to discuss the matter with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with their children, can reflect on how this is viewed in our family.
After all, do we think the world is a safe place or an insecure place?
Parents may also have different upbringing perspectives — some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child will be given a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.

Your own strength at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
The Balloon Lighthouse is hard to contain.
Perttu Pohjola was able to polish Apila’s Pallosalama to a blunt blow in the middle of summer.
It only ravaged victories and second places, until the end of July when the Tampere rave collapsed.
Because the stallion was clotting, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a time from the vet for his shelter.
The explanation for the exhaustion was found in the endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but it took two courses of medication to overcome it.
As Apilan Pallosalama was forced to do light exercise, Pohjola says that she is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
In Turku it was the second SE-damm after Taruntuuli in record time.
Apila’s Ball Flash was under a lot of pressure from the break, as it had been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
Taking these things into account, the small bending at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a decent race made the stallion's edge.
The horse’s rhythm must have moved on from there, and I hope it would have stabilized as well.
The Apilan Pallosalama has been a so-called humorous horse.
When it wasn't fun, it could have thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallion has loosened such a lightning bolt that the opponents have been amazed.
At short speeds, the competitors cannot make it to Pallosalama, where even warm-blooded rides can be taken off.
In the wishes of the Nordics, there is a pee-running in Vermo.
However, it is a different matter as to how the Pallosalama of Apila will agree to it.
It’s pretty hard at the time of departure and it might even stick under the boom of the departure car and stuff like that.
Hopefully the horse will be calmer than it was before it left.
Apilan Pallosalama will be able to come from the bow if he is fit, and we will drive it for victory, the coach promises.
This Is Why You Can't Get Rid of Unnecessary iPhone Apps
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple iPhones may be removed sometime in the future – but not all.
Apple may be planning to remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future, CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with Buzzfeed.
Apple’s iPhone has a number of apps that relatively few people use: For example, FaceTime calls, Newsstand, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these apps is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhones, although it is only necessary for owners of Apple smartwatches.
According to Cook, removing Apple’s apps is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to someone else on your iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone,” Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work closely with other apps.
There are other programs that don’t work that way.
So over time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to delete them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the issue, as the company does not want to waste memory space on users’ iPhones.
Eurozone inflation fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, by 0.1 per cent year-on-year, Eurostat, the EU’s statistical authority, said today.
The rise in prices was driven downwards by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% a few weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
Base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of underlying inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2 per cent cheaper than a year ago.
In the EU-28, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Among the euro countries, consumer prices rose most, by 1.4 per cent, in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest when prices fell by 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the harmonised price index of the EU.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far removed from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of a price increase of close to 2% over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1 per cent, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts published in early September.
The U.S. Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next recession in the U.S. will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely within three years after the Federal Reserve begins to raise its interest rates again after a long time.
And the downturn in the financial markets begins before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that interest rate hikes may begin as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession could hit the spotlight as quickly as possible by next autumn and the turmoil of the financial markets before that.
Or at least this is what will happen if the world’s largest economy and financial markets function as they used to do – and if they react to the Fed’s blackmail like they did in the past.
These are the conclusions of the German bank’s London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed its 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international large customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and the report do not pretend to know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and markets afterwards.
Instead, they use cool facts and calculations from economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed’s takeovers.
In addition to historical observations, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or different pattern as at the time of previous interest rate hikes – and what the possible consequences are.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more shattered condition to withstand the rise in interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
Not a year into recession.
Throughout the summer and early autumn, the leaders who decide on the Fed’s monetary policy and its current stance have hinted that the time has come to raise interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates in more than nine years can already occur this week.
The matter will be resolved in the course of Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board will meet to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds interest rate was in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but small 0.25 percentage points of interest increases, which lasted exactly two years, ended, with which the Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The symptoms of the financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis tore into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, the severe hardships in the financial markets and the real economy started slower than has typically happened since previous Fed interest rate hikes.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than at any time since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche’s strategies have screened the rises and declines of the world’s largest economies and the turnarounds of the financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
They have been reporting on the Fed’s borrowings and their economic and financial impact since the 1950s.
The fastest time since the beginning of the recession is less than a year, usually less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rise in the financial markets has ended within a year or two after the start of the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
Since the beginning of the 1950s, the Fed has increased and decreased its interest rate by a dozen cycles of varying lengths.
Each time has differed in some respects from the other, and the multiplier is relatively scarce in the examination, so it is hardly possible to deduce anything certain about the effects of subsequent interest rate increases.
The strategy reminds us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be unequivocally discovered even by decades of research.
But three reasons for the crisis and its increasing destructive power are perhaps somewhat undeniable:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the techno bubble tracks, while growing the next one.
2) The accumulated and already excessive amount of debt in various parts of the financial and real economy over the decades grew even larger due to the excessive monetary policy of central banks.
It was the biggest debt bubble in economic history.
3) The insanely low-cost debt financing packaged in the financial economy, in particular, almost without hindrance, inflated the largest exchange rate bubbles in the history of the financial market, from stocks to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is unlikely that there will be much controversy that the financial markets, which have risen to heights on the basis of increasingly complex leverage, were in an unusually dangerous and volatile state when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates upwards.
The financial structures geared to leverage did not last long, let alone the valuation bubbles, since interest rate increases had started and the cost of debt financing had started to rise.
The risks materialised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give cause for reflection by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Indebtedness has not been insanely cheap for a long time, as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than it is free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now, in different parts of the economy, a heavier debt burden than before the financial crisis or ever before.
(3) More and cheaper liquidity from central banks has largely remained in the financial markets, squeezing key asset classes to their most expensive level, whether at the pre-financial crisis peak or at any time.
And not only do the strategists lax the mood with the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the worst recession in decades as it has in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks in the financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts tightening its money traps more tightly.
Perhaps the future of Albert Edwards, the strategist of the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it may seem.
For some time now, he has been training the bank’s international investor clients for the following Fed turnarounds:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst – and soon it’s time for the Fed to extinguish the financial fires with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions will go to HP’s corporate service provider, the company said.
In November, HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a sales company, and HP Inc., a consumer PC and printer company.
HP had its highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, the number of personnel had been reduced to 302,000.
The company recognises non-recurring costs of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
25,000-30,000 redundancies at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
The reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees will be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10 percent of its operating result.
Last year, its three most significant customers accounted for 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System on iPhone After Apple Update Release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, your phone gives you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have encountered problems after this installation when the "Software Update Failed" error message appears on the screen.
To overcome this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try an update through iTunes.
The phone guides the user through the final process.
This may include removing apps to gain status, but Apple has reduced the chance of this by reducing the size of the update, and also made the process easier with a new tool that suggests apps to remove and then reinstall them when the update is complete.
You should make sure that your phone is charged or close to the charger during the update so that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple won’t let the update go forward, because if the battery runs out, it can lead to a breach of the update.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to Yle, the company’s activities involve so-called tax planning.
This is the case of the Luxembourg-based company Saltri II LuxCo, of which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself said he had filed for resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place within the agreed timeframe,” says Berner in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The holdings of the Swedish company Kährs are managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor from 2010 to 2013 and, after the merger, on the Board of Directors of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs’s holdings in Luxembourg pass through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This is Hartwall Capital.
I have been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the interests of the capital of a Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from our Finnish companies’ capital is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context,” says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in a tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs’ largest shareholder, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Reception centre maintained by the company opens in Espoo
The first reception centre for adult asylum seekers operated by the company will open in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take in the first 100 inhabitants as early as 6 p.m.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre on the property of the former Rescue Institute.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose area of activity is the production of health care and medical services in particular.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy have jointly agreed on the security arrangements of the centre.
STTK is preparing an alternative work-life blackmail package
STTK is preparing an alternative package for the government’s work-life blackmail.
The organization also wants to include other employee associations.
According to President Antti Palola, at the moment the focus is on Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative ways to lower the price of labour will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola told reporters during a break in the organization’s administration meeting.
Palola believes that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK’s economists have calculated that the change protection included in the Government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package will cost EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if there's such a great deal of enthusiasm on the part of a party to have a conversation if there's a one-to-one relationship on the side of getting it.
Palola: Negotiating relationship was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) has called for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the Government is expected to submit a communication to Parliament on its own package and start preparing for reforms.
He did not say whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government and it has been constructive all along.
According to Palola, the STTK field, especially Sunday surgeries, is a painful place.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from mandatory legislation to carry out part of the blackmail.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP that has raised the issue.
Employees will gather in Helsinki on Friday to protest the government’s work-related blackmail package presented last week.
As part of the package, for example, the pay for the first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
The STTK emphasizes that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration, and it was not the intention to organise a strike.
Akava Fjäder
Akava’s Chairman Sture Fjäder commends STTK’s announcement that an alternative package has been prepared.
According to Fjäder, STTK will now be in line with Akava, as an alternative model for the board’s proposals has been outlined in Akava for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hopes that SAK, headed by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing a proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK announced earlier Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change protection and working hours banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time, with which it is ready to negotiate the government’s goal of a five per cent competitive jump as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are ready to look at the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change protection and working time banks,” says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava’s lines, as STTK has done earlier Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package will not be strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that will work for the government and employers in the country, Fjäder says.
Akava's Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, let's work" - playing bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
The Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva bingo coupon from the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
Prime Ministers have previously made exception speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and the wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for the previous speech of the Prime Minister, one must go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was prime minister when he gave the famous radio address that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers gave several radio talks during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train operators with a televised speech.
The monologue, the monarchist spirit
His speech has aroused criticism and speculation all day long about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that “Sipilä could make his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow us to discuss the speech”.
According to the Greens, “the monologue has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja said on Facebook that “the prime minister tells the people what is best for them.”
Antti Rinne, chairman of the SDP, challenged Sipilä to the dialogue: "Soon, six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance by the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What's <0x40>Juhasipila afraid of?
Public Service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, comments were made live by Lauri Lyly, Chairman of SAK, and Jyri Häkämies, CEO of EK.
He has been criticized for giving his speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity throughout Finland, says Ismo Silvo, Director of Publications at Yle.
As we were in the days of Tammelo
The speech has also given rise to ridicule.
When evening comes, the dinner is enjoyed in good time, the children are combed and dressed in their best.
Mom puts on a pretty skull and dad fits a tie around his neck.
At 9 a.m., we’ll be quieter before the TV than we used to be in the days of Me Tammeloi,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Will Prime Minister Sipilä also tell us in his speech why there are millionaires in the Finnish government hiding their capital in tax havens, who draft amnesty laws for their fellow tax evasives and at the same time claim to the people that they have to cut money when the government is out of money?” asks Pia Lohikoski.
What Sipilä says, one guess is made by Viva, the Green Left of the University of Tampere.
It has posted a bingo on Facebook.
Will we hear tonight about the same boat, common coal, living in debt and team spirit?
The coupons and pens are ready, it starts at 21:05 and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to overthrow Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia’s bid to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan that would allow Assad to step down in style after some time.
However, the West did not accept the proposal because it believed that al-Assad would fall within a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin listed a three-point plan for him in a bilateral discussion: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to have immediate communication, and the resignation of al-Assad had to be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Cherkin.
We may not agree on all the points, but we can discuss them openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said to sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell him what we have to do,” Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari said he had forwarded the message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Churkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari’s allegations, but said al-Assad’s forces had already carried out several massacres at the time, and the main opposition groups refused to accept any agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the Middle East Department at the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about Ahtisaari’s speeches because, according to his experience, Russia was never prepared to discuss the fate of Assad.
Russia has supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Churkin spoke with a Moscow mandate.
If he had told me about Chechurkin’s speeches, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would still have suspected that it was Putin’s gimmick to hold power over some of Assad’s supporters.
The refugee flow by our own actions
During Ahtisaari’s talks, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I have no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Organising centre for asylum seekers in Tornio
The asylum-seekers’ organisation centre planned by the Government for Northern Finland will probably be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty building of the Tornio Commons in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council would have already decided to propose the school building to the ministry as a space solution.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen, Vice-President of Tornio City Council (left), this is not true.
When the whole council was not together and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he clarifies to STT.
36 of the 43 delegates were present.
Thirteen delegates opposed the Centre.
On that basis, one could expect a positive decision, Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and reacted quickly.
The number of asylum seekers is estimated to be 500 at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense, Nousiainen says.
He is still looking for an alternative to blackmail.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre), the public halving of holiday money would only take care of part of the reduction in the price of work sought by the Government.
However, the government will gladly accept the package of alternatives if the social partners manage to agree on it.
Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for substitutes for the government-announced extortions.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä’s view, halving holiday money would be a resort, as it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government’s planned cut in Sunday allowances.
Labour market organisations could agree among themselves on a reduction in holiday allowances, as they are enshrined in collective agreements rather than in the law.
The Government is expected to report to Parliament on Wednesday next week on the tightening of working life in the form of a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work will then start, i.e. the train is on the move and it will become more and more difficult.
This is a good time.
It won’t be long in such matters, if you have the will, Sipilä said.
The list published by the Government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of Epiphany and Holy Thursday into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the pay for the first days of sickness is cut, overtime pay is halved, Sunday pay is reduced to 75% and holidays are shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation past the trade unions, which has given rise to strong criticism.
As a result of the action, the workers' unions are holding a large demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi council approves expansion of juice hall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy hall, i.e. the juice hall warehouse.
The criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
There is also a busy schedule.
It was also a little surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous expansion was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 m2 was approved for the investment programme, but the funding will be decided later in the interim report.
An investment of EUR 150,000 to EUR 200,000 was still discussed on the agenda, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
A place for the Karelian language in Joensuu
The City Board eased its previous stance on bringing Karelian street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in terms of preserving the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical reasons for this and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has belonged more to the eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no Karelian street name signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Karelian language, for example, in information boards and tourism marketing, on a case-by-case basis.
The city recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the Karelian language should also be approached openly now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in North Karelia as well.
The Karelian language is still a distinctive feature of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both of these can be used in a variety of marketing activities in the region.
Decommissioning of train connections reduces the vitality of the province
Cuts in train connections are hitting the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region’s business life and competitiveness.
And it affects whether it is possible to live and work here at all, Kari Karjalainen, mayor of Joensuu, wonders.
He also mentioned air transport, which has also been the subject of a number of reports.
It is important for the whole region that our chances are not reduced by state measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the impact of these disconnections on employment, for example, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees,” says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research team, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of the research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult to market the university to Western Finland because of poor transversal connections.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside of Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by the direct train connection.
From Joensuu came one gravel voice to Siu's war
The City Council of Joensuu’s view on the Siun Sote provincial project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is also there.
Member of the City Board Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the picture) proposed to abandon the entire project at the board meeting on Monday, but his proposal fell unprofitable.
The Government approved Mayor Kari Karjalainen’s draft resolution, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although one pair of trains will be fewer.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains is missed, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ purchase money for rail transport for the next four-year period will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely closed.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
Boys climbed the roof, one couldn't get down, guys snuck away
Rescue services let a 12-year-old climber on the roof, who could not get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki at Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladders to the roof.
That didn’t stop the group of boys who decided to climb on the roof of the house along the radio amateur mast next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others snuck off the scene and passers-by alerted the rescue services to help the last one on the roof get safely back to the ground.
FedEx's operating profit is twofold, lowering outlook for tax year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year earnings forecast due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs for ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
By this time last year, FedEx announced it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share fell by approximately 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening hours.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the end of the fiscal year next May to be <0x24>10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than its previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting <0x24>10.84, according to a FactSet poll.
The smaller outlook came despite an average price increase of 4.9%, which will take effect on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for land transport of heavy or large parcels starting in November.
The company said it expects its operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year as they have cut costs, revenue has increased and e-commerce is growing.
President and CEO Fred Smith said the company "will perform steadily in light of the worse-than-expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for pay for the holidays were announced a day after competitor UPS announced plans to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, roughly the same number it hired last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned <0x24>692 million, a 6 percent increase from last year.
The profit per share was <0x24>2.42, remaining on the average of <0x24>2.44, a survey conducted by 12 analysts by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased by 5% to <0x24>12.3 billion.
In the Zacks survey, six analysts expected <0x24>12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a decline in international priority shipping, which has stopped the development of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land unit increased by 29 per cent, but the revenue from operations was basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and own insurance.
The revenues of the Express unit were better due to higher basic fees, while the operating profit in freight operations decreased due to higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, approximately one hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares fell by <0x24>3.85, or 2.5%, to <0x24>150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 percent of the drop for this year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
This week, the central bank of the United States sits around a huge mahogany table for two days in a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that central bank president Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests above everything else.
Congress has placed a twofold responsibility on the central bank: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep prices stable.
However, after the Great Depression, central bank governors have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that could be a decisive factor in the decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted, a decision as to whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the record-breaking stimulus brought about by the near-zero rate of short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows the economy is growing steadily, the recent turmoil in the global financial markets may have made pre-warned central bank officials even more frightened when it comes to increasing instability. There are fears about the impact if the federal funds rate reference value were raised by at least a quarter of a percentage point.
"Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important issues to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Financial Officer at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I do believe, however, that if they are looking for justification for keeping interest rates unchanged, the increased uncertainty in the world market is a valid enough reason to wait yet," he says.
There is no consensus on the central bank's decision, which is already causing nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg study, about half of financial experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator shows that the potential for growth is only about 30%.
This indicates a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next raise will not happen in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, from a new figure of 16,599.85.
The recovery was triggered by the expectation that the central bank will maintain its level this week, says John Lonski, chief finance expert at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, “they will have to put a lot of effort into their policies to support the financial markets so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts argue that an elevated level would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank will act.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation, which would confirm the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has said in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals are calling for more economic development in their complaints.
While job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1 per cent, the lowest rate in seven years and close to what the Central Bank considers to be the limit for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of a pick-up.
While inflation is still below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, central bank decision-makers say the main reason for this is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "is able to cope with higher interest rates and also needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, Chief Financial Specialist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world shook last week as China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by as much as 16 percent from its May record, as investors feared the slowdown in China’s economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10 percent below its peak in May.
For central bank makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells when interest rates need to be raised.
“Without these financial market events and the recent news of China’s economic weakness, policymakers would tighten the bar at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision makers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
"The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still unclear, and they have little information about the consequences of what happened in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not influence decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank has exerted enormous influence.
In 2013, the insinuation of the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, that the central bank could "reduce" the increase in the amount of money, caused upheavals in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more art than science,” says Zachary Karabell, Global Strategy Manager for asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that “the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that appear to be separate from economic fundamentals.”
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for the interest rate to be increased, and Mr Lacker, a member of the committee entitled to vote, refers to the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "despite its limited, identifiable impact on U.S. economic growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should only prioritise financial stability during a major crisis, as did when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate fixing committee.
The latest turmoil is nowhere near its level, Posen says.
"Nobody wants a situation where raising interest rates is feared because the market will be upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability, and as long as that is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazil’s Paediatric Association in Rio Grande Advertises a Healthy Diet for Breastfeeding
The Brazilian Pediatrics Association (SPRS) has come up with a shocking way to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect a child’s immune system.
Seven-channel Sunrise is a favorite in viewing numbers, despite Nine channel’s attempts to report executive disclosure on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic’s and Lisa Wilkinson’s rush to Canberra to report the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader revelation failed to increase Today’s viewership.
The Nine Channel morning program was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull overthrew Tony Abbott.
The competing show Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its weeklong series of international broadcasts covering Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The ballast of distance did not seem to harm Australian TV viewers, with Sunrise’s average viewership in five state capitals being 397,000, compared to 339,000 in Today.
Today’s average rose slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has captured Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, the average was 318,000 for Today and 330,000 for Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators, compared to 314,000 today.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning not only in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the 800 words series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing premiere.
The new drama series, which gathered a pretty impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson is the carrier of the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
Seven's The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had a dual destiny on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz program hosted by Andrew O'Keefe attracted an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 spectators - enough to win a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat program (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia’s average audience for the first half-hour was 520,000, and for the second half-hour it was as high as 720,000.
The average Hot Seat was 620,000.
The Chase Australia’s second-night average drop gives Nine the confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the number of viewers on the McGuire program.

The final trio agree with the dads that Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who won The Bachelor Series.
The identity of the woman with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor has been kept secret.
The three remaining girls don't really slip who got the last rose.
However, in conversation with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could inadvertently give a clue as to the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's finale
All three women became poetic when they said that Wood was a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family value, and positivity as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
When asked, “If Wood’s last rose isn’t for you, to whom should it go?” their answers may have provided a revelation of who won the bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best alternative to Wood after them.
The relationship between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been smooth since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarahi) energies and Sam's energies felt quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down-to-earth, it's fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said last week’s home visits made him realize that Wood could be “the one.”
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that clearly this isn't just a game - I'm now in it with all my heart," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can tell you," he said.
I like the rest of the girls just as much, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten Channel.

Jarry Hayne has many options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in him after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him after his impressive open practice day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the relegation bench for the final game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first flight kick when the team defeated Minnesota on Tuesday with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayne to return the next kick and took her to the running game after Reggie Bush's injury.
The real nature of Tomsula was also visible in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his newcomers a pawn in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers special editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the Minnesota Vikings' first quarter of the game.
This was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wanted for his NFL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing on the way out of the field after the fall, and later told Australian radio pair Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his groping to his 2007 Origin debut, when a pass in his own goal area led to a Queensland goal.
All in all, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for her Instagram account in a photo with fans holding an Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia’s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun on a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 killed after police shot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country's new draft constitution, the official said Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior official in the region, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to cause so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhesi say that the new provinces set up under the proposed new constitution are undermining their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal, where the Tharus group is calling for a state of its own.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed a treaty that divided the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week, legislators have voted on the clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and the authorities have said that the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
US National Hurricane Center says there is a 60% chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde
The wide low-pressure front, located about 560 kilometers south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verdean archipelago, has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another precise low-pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verdean archipelago and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next two days, the Miami Weather Center added.
Google launches donation campaign to raise <0x24>11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has launched a donation campaign to raise <0x24>11 million to humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees arriving in Europe fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal point of view when it published the donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of being reported by the director, Google’s Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote about her personal experience.
"We travelled on numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations are made to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugeerelief up to <0x24>5.5 million, with an overall target of <0x24>11 million.
Europe is experiencing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight Loss Surgery Can Help Mildly Obese Diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last at least five years.
However, it’s still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after a weight loss operation than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get the mortality data," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in weight loss surgery who wrote the editorial for a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
In bariatric surgery, various methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects in the study have been morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
The BMI, or weight-to-length ratio, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI above 25 indicates that someone is overweight, and a person with a BMI above 30 is considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, to drug treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of those who had undergone surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of those treated by means other than surgery remained roughly the same at 29.
Of the people who were cut, 36 percent had full and 28 percent had partial improvement in diabetes.
By comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes improved by only 1% and partially by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and the "bad" LDL-cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors noted.
The researchers also tracked patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c levels should remain below 7%, the researchers wrote.
Post-operative haemoglobin A1c levels fell from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the drug treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
However, this improved "glycemic control", as described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The team also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
By the fifth year, when compared to the gastric reduction group, the gastric bypass group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased its BMI more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased its hemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1 and 2.1 %), and was more likely to have achieved a complete remission of diabetes (16,7 %, 46, and 46).
The University of Arizona’s College of Medicine-Phoenix’s Blackstone says that while the study shows no survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people undergoing weight loss surgery were 29 percent less likely to die over a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study doesn’t show any improvement in survivor survival, Blackstone says the results are nevertheless encouraging for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the study are crucial precisely in that they show that surgery is safe for a group with a lower body mass index," and is not associated with an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when the patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the inauguration of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the UK, which is dedicated to the study of ethics.
The Dalai Lama argued that, in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put before the needs of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that, although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“It’s great to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The bottom line is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Commenting on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the U.S.’s violent response caused the chain’s violent events.
“After the 9/11 strike, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem would be through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, the ingestion of hand sanitizer for children has increased fourfold.
Poisoning information centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in the ingestion of strong alcohol-containing hand disinfectant in children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Georgia Poisoning Information Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poisoning Information Center, the number of cases of ingestion of the disinfectant reported to poisoning information centers in children under the age of 12 increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are more often interested in these products, and unfortunately a certain percentage of them go to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or respond to a challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teens drink disinfectant to get low-cost ascent booze.
According to reports, teens have mixed a disinfectant with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant scents of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (handmade) ones are those with added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange fragrance disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
A hand sanitizer can contain anything between 45% and 95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few injections are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton, director of medical care at the University of Kansas Hospital's Poison Information Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So please don’t leave the whiskey shot lying on the table, but the hand disinfectant is left visible, and if children are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the adult drunken driving limit, says Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaiyah mossed while talking and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused her to fall over and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
The situation could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and remove the disinfectant from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing a hand sanitizer containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which had been declared as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in northern New York State planned to poison their "evil" teachers by spreading bacterial toxins into the classroom, a police report said.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from her class.
The police should prevent the plan from being a "funny nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumor: Celtic has no controversy
Griffiths disparages talk of Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but she makes it turn.
The Hearts fight Neilson's charges against the Scottish Football Association, and Warburton is alert to January's recruitments that could disrupt the team's integrity
Dons raised his lead to five points at Celtic
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and allowed the team to increase the gap to five points.
Griffiths dismisses controversy
Celtic's internal conflicts have been rumoured to have arisen, but Griffiths immediately passed them, claiming that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer scrutiny as the team is preparing to face the Dutch league leader.
“I don’t think we’re under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with the Rangers.
Ajax’s current ambassador, de Boer, said: “The highlights of the Celtic games are no longer shown in the Netherlands, and why?”
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here just can't talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and also non-Scottish people like to follow them in the games.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting drop from the Champions League quickly resulted in a loss to Aberdeen, who played with ten men, now top of the league with a five-point difference to the next.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had some bad episodes before, and we're going up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton warns of game transfers in January
While Rangers boss Mark Warburton just commented on possible January transfer targets, he remains alert to the recruiting frenzy, reassuring that he doesn’t want to confuse the crowd with consensus.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For future players in the summer, the adjustment period is the entire pre-season period, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's interest in Michu hints of retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name is associated with Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has hinted that he may retire after his contract with the Swans ends.
The 29-year-old player has had an ankle problem for two years and was unable to find a new club outside of Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football Federation over Neilson’s comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was already the third red card in the last eight months judged by Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson goes on to say, “I didn’t question honesty, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths Swear to Avoid Tynecastle
A loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded for admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a whim," the striker said, adding, "It's safe to say I won't return to Tynecastle unless I move to Celtic."
Tannadice's Board Believes in Dundee United's Leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly argues that the board of Dundee United still has faith in the leadership team’s ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back in shape," Donnelly says.
McInnes delighted with "ugly victory" in Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, desperately hung in the game against Hamilton Accies, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick, he managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league victory, raising them to the top of the table by five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, “There is no team that has won anything, whether it’s a trophy or a league that hasn’t won games that way.”
Unemployment among Scots will remain the same as the UK's total number grows
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment in the UK rose by 10,000 to a total of 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the UK at 5.5 per cent, according to figures from the National Statistical Office (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a three-month period, and the number of people in employment now stands at 2,612,000.
During the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74%, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scotland’s Secretary of State, David Mundell, commented on these latest figures: “The government’s long-term plan is to build the foundations for a stronger economy.”
Almost exactly one year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why I witness execution in Oklahoma
If there is no judicial intervention, later today I will watch the man be executed.
If it does, and I hope it doesn't, I'll sit in the audience gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and watch Richard Glossip be executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through her best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to feel terrible about this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Journalists do, of course, have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than seats available, participants are selected through a horrific lottery.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for the media from twelve to five.
Whoever is elected will watch the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip, and I have also made my own contact with him through months of calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like him.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be both a witness and a reporter, so I must not have a notebook and pen with me to record what I have seen.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist tweeted that I had compromised my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to, and you'll be able to participate.
I complained to a reporter.
The wedding admitted that “it could have been better put” but still feels that what I’m doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he said it.
I have told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is by my side.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to my series of podcasts.
I will not go through all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of aiding and abetting anyway.
But I believe there is a very strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder.
I am sure that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view from which I see him dying.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I give you a description of how it feels to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
Man lured out of Canning River after watery police hunt
Canning Vale's officer stayed dry when he lured him out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a Perth-based man to distract the cops went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just meters away from a policeman who was trying to “tenderly lure him back to the beach.”
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for unauthorized intrusion.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading into the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying, 'I'm not coming out, come get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn’t want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: “decent police consultation.”
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Ben Cousins is a great example.
In 2006, the Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his attempt, but he inspired the locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims officials tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's agents tried to infiltrate his stables last year, threatening to stop racing immediately.
He accuses the editors and the integrity division of Racing Victoria of claiming that they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late abandonment due to a treatment procedure on the day of the race was the last staple.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation since Lidar’s inexplicably positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue in check for a year and a half on spy claims, and he did not want it to “look like envy.”
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything breaks down at once," Moody said.
They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home tonight and sleeping well.
I want to walk with my head up and I want the owners to think I'm doing the best I can for them.
When they start to think differently, then I don’t have to continue as a coach anymore.
Then I would have to consider what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, where he said that the integrity department had tried to spy on his team.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man — I name him when asked — and offered him a job in my stables if he conveyed information about what I was doing there.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start to think that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become a man and maybe to pass on responsibility to not just the coaches for what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Perhaps they will have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I am saying now will possibly make them think exactly that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really saddens me.
I press them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s frustration has increased with long-term Lidar cobalt research, and his late rejection led him to find that he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for coaching the invincible master Black Caviar, has called the rule of race day care "ridiculous" after putting a mud or clay bath on the horse's feet, which is irregular.
“It is against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on it.
It could have had a hatch last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
He had it on the day of the race.
Moody may be facing a three-month ban on competition due to the hatchery treatment of the race day, from which the officials started the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver arrested for traffic evacuation
Police have arrested a man who escaped from traffic after colliding with a cyclist in Cobra.
The cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital after being seriously injured when a car hit him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver was driving away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported himself to police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, of failing to provide assistance and of other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, is still in the hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Attacks Competitors in Wrestling Claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the two NRL rugby league champions’ favorite claims that his team’s tackles would be part of the “direction.”
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "wrestle" on his side when he unexpectedly won the final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett was barely able to hide his reference to Storm after he defeated the North Queensland Cowboys in the finals on Saturday night. Bennett called the game a "showcase" in the rugby league and said that the two Queensland teams were not "very excited" about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team’s tackles and said they were just focusing on “contact” when tackling.
Bellamy added that her confidence was heightened by the criticism of Storm by the two leading coaches, which means they fear losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost them 24-2," Bellamy said.
I can assure you that we have not exchanged anything in our defence systems or technologies throughout the year, and over the last six weeks, we have only stressed contact in tackles, and that has made us successful.
“Trent has been on the team for three years and obviously has a great team to coach, so he’s probably not used to losing, so this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett coached the St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "dull".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby game.
"He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn’t care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby that we find exciting, especially since he has quick young friends.
That’s the kind of game you want to play when you have those types of players.
He brought that up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby – not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I get more confident when they say things like that because they’re a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more scored than the game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it exciting to break the line of defense and not score a goal?
For me, this is about guidelines.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend, as they have already won the right to play at home against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-final at AAMI Park next Saturday night.
Serb man gets <0x24>200,000 bail on drug charges
A man threatened with life imprisonment for attempted possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on a <0x24>200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked down 100 kilograms of the drug to the Solay yacht that came to South America via Vanuatu and landed at Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with other defendants at the marina all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilos of drugs in a Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic is threatened with life imprisonment for attempted possession of cocaine for business purposes, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic was attempting to hold the entire quantity and that he could have been in the cafeteria for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has strong ties to Serbia.
He travels frequently to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovic’s mother and stepfather had jointly offered a security deposit of <0x24>200,000 to secure his release.
"After reading both people's sworn statements, it's clear that placing a <0x24>200,000 bail is a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on condition that he surrendered both his Australian and Serbian passports, reported to the police on a daily basis, and maintained his curfew between six o’clock in the evening and six o’clock in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to lure pedophiles to send photos
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl’s phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
While she was sleeping, Stevan Hogg took her phone and then logged in to an online communications service, where Hogg received numerous obscene pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She searched her phone and found shocking messages, and immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five pictures, searched the computers on the scene, and found "troubling" online searches using keywords that had been used to search for immoral pictures of children.
Hogg then told police that he had done this “to entice pedophiles” on the Internet before “pretending to be a police officer to scare them.”
Fiscal depute representative Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had performed the searches on a computer, but said that they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to frighten pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the photos, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said that after drinking, he's sick of his head, and he wants to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she shouted at her mother, shook and cried.
The mother saw the obscene pictures on the phone and then met the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, a 23-year-old from Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to making or taking pictures of immoral children on 14 June last year, breaching his bail on 25 January this year and not appearing in court on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered as a sex offender, claiming that his crime did not involve a "significant sexual element."
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal has postponed the sentence until October to allow social services time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he's under arrest before trial.
He was added to the sex offenders' register before the verdict.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe gives the wrong speech to parliament
Africa’s oldest leader, Mugabe, fell on the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tainted by allegations by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him with interlocutors when he gave a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a group discipline supervisor for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe’s speech.
"The number from which the message was sent is not responding, but the message is titled 'death,'" Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament and that, when they step out, parliamentary immunity would not apply.
The group discipline overseer said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the business services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from its faster-growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will cost about <0x24>2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring efforts will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today’s HP, and we will have a broad and deep range of services to help companies move into a new kind of business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than <0x24>50 billion and will “concentrate on delivering unparalleled integrated technology solutions” to businesses, the company said in a statement.
The division breaks up a company that Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded in the 1930s to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, called "The Birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has gone through a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its division is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that tightly constrained companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb draws
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least the next four English games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that Wilshere’s end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the start of the season.
"Such an injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but as Wenger also admitted, there is always a risk of further injury when a player attempts to return mid-season.
There is also an inconvenient model.
According to research from Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since her debut six years ago.
In addition, he has played only 65 of Arsenal’s 157 league games in the last five seasons.
Looking at Arsenal’s overall performance since the 2007–08 season, in six out of eight seasons, it has been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes their improvement in injury statistics from last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you recover from an injury, it can be a prone period when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and he can get the career he deserves.
Wenger prepares to circulate as Arsenal starts their Champions League game against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably starting.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a break to the players who want it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up to the F-Block, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
Dynamo has also not lost 41 games since they produced their own “Invincible” campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earthquake of magnitude 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned the lessons of last season’s Champions League surrender against Monaco, and is still motivated by a distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions do not exist in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than in the last fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Men’s Year, the goal being to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
According to a recent study of over 2,000 high school and high school students who showed depression symptoms, the chances of a person recovering doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of their friends were “healthy.”
Similarly, those who were not depressed were half as likely to have potential mental health problems if they had mentally healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this time of communication through social media, the style passes by the content, and the immediateness of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyful, and successful, while in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this is done at the expense of internal values - the inner longing for personal growth and friendship - which affect our mental health more deeply.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn’t make you happier.
The great thing about Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which stood out clearly in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they often hesitate to fully explore their emotions.
As a Samaritans volunteer explained to me: “When I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I really understand how even the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better.”
Often the men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to their friends.
The old idea of “overcoming” is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up to problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping methods.
It highlights the little moments of friendship between men.
While my impartial, external position at the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
So if you’re attending Comedy Central’s FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned to celebrate the celebration, why not take your friends for a coffee at Central Perk?
Or, even better, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends are broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö to the side
Angel Di Maria celebrates goals against Malmö with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan.
Angel Di Maria scored a goal in his Champions League debut, helping PSG bypass the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is a match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the Champions League in her debut in less than four minutes, pointing the way for the French league champions, but the team lost several chances before finally increasing their lead with Cavan scoring the goal in the 61st minute.
“Paris, who is in the same group A as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as there was not only a place in the game but also an improvement in their games leading to the quarter-finals in the last three rounds.
But even though the PSG scored, it wasn't a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost a place in front of a goal and was later replaced from the pitch. Malmö is the team of his old hometown and the one where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for the opponent and look good in the stats, and it's a good start, even though there are things we'll have to hone this season," Blanc said.
This predicts good.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we were not able to score one or two more goals.
After being injured, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of the three changes made after the team lost a 2-2 draw in the Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he left Manchester United last month, the Argentine quarterback was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe, and he testified why when he ran to catch Marco Verratt’s pass behind Malmö’s defense line and then struck a beautiful finish by Johan Wiland in the back of the net.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a crowded opponent, defeating Celtic in the final match, reaching this level, with nine international players and a five-man defense and two players in the deep midfield.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which almost passed Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
In contrast, PSG was sometimes hit by a lack of assists and a poor finish, especially by Ibrahimovic, who failed in five attempts in the first half alone and was subsequently disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more efficient in pre-working for his colleagues, and it was after Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent a spiral kick that tilted around Wiland's goalpost at 52 minutes.
The second goal was scored after an hour of play, thanks to Uruguayan Cavan, who scored his sixth goal after Ibrahimovic pushed Maxwell forward from the left.
That was the end of Malmö’s hopes to get back into the game, and only Wiland’s brilliant fight against David Luiz’s direct kick kept the final numbers down before the swap goal of Ezequiel Lavezz was rejected at the very end of the game.
Malmö's coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was at the same level as his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualifying matches aren't enough.
I'll put my hat on Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore raises <0x24>2.5 billion by selling shares
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, who suffered from the collapse of commodity prices, raised <0x24>2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with collapsed commodity prices as the slowdown in China’s economy strains demand and destroys all markets.
The new subscription raised the value of Glencore’s shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday’s morning trading.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed a <0x24>2.5 billion stock deal last week as part of a broader plan to cut its <0x24>30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold new share capital for 125 pence, a reduction of 2.4 percent on Tuesday’s closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, which totalled 9.99 percent of the Group's value.
Concerns about the long-term stagnation of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a White House statement released Tuesday confirmed.
Xi’s first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The president and wife of the president, Michelle Obama, will host a dinner for Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
“Prince X’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand US-China cooperation on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X an opportunity to discuss constructively issues where there are disagreements,” the statement added.
During the visit, which was first announced in February, Xi is also expected to visit Seattle on his trip to Washington to meet with numerous U.S. tech leaders before continuing towards New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and the country’s increased unconditionality in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon says he is different in filmmaking.
Matt Damon and African-American filmmaker Effie Brown came together to discuss a difference that Damon says isn’t needed behind the scenes.
In the Sunday night episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor interrupted Brown, emphasizing the need for different perspectives on the dark-skinned protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"When we talk about difference, it's taken into account when selecting actors for a movie, not a series," Damon said.
Shocked, Brown reacted with offended disbelief, commenting "Oh! Wow. Okay," while The Martian actor's comments remained hanging in the air.
Other producers, Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers, joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series' finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think, no matter who the director is, about how they treat Harmony’s character,” Brown said.
The only dark figure is a whore hit by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the rights to direct the film for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied rudely that their directing "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the conversation was posted, social media exploded to disapprove of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clip by writing, “Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining the difference to him is SO WHITE it hurts.”
The tweets collected over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes after their release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the Album of the Year nominees for a Grammy Award.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently published a statement to answer the Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the executives said.
It was recently reported that Damon was among entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or whether he has already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
On Monday, professional rock climber and dish collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and receive a <0x24>1 million top prize as a reward.
It was in the competition programme, which ended its seventh season, that there has never been a competitor who has survived all sections of the obstacle course of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The last task was to climb a 20-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge on time, making him the first athlete ever to complete the exhausting fourth installment of the American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock to win the <0x24>1 million grand prize.
"So it's great to think about this, because I've never made or lived anything but <0x24>10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after a big pay rise.
So all of a sudden...I can’t even imagine what this will be like...the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed sat down to talk with The Hollywood Reporter about the finalist and why Britten is not getting more rewards, despite being the first ever competitor to cross the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money gets to the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he's resentful.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family man.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same if it had been the other way around.
American Ninja Warrior returns to season 8, which will be filmed in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now the last in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers played their role as a spoiler perfectly on Tuesday when they won the Minnesota Twins’ 5-4 Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to get halfway across the Houston Astros in a competition for another American League wild card slot.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to access for most of the latter half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they get them," said Team Leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support while Detroit made the run three times in the first two innings, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and made three runs.
This was his third game in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end to this year," Simon said.
It’s hard for a changer to pass in every game, and that’s why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitute Victor Martinez hit three times and made two runs possible, which were his first hits since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hit night since he hit the Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He waved the bat very well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in stroke drills), looked significantly better in stroke drills and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance to get back into the game.
Byron Buxton started the innings by knocking out twice on the left-hand field line.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks went home with a click of one hive, and Simon was able to burn down Brian Dozier, a second hive player, before Simon was replaced by Blaine Hardy, a left-handed player.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player standing against him, ahead of the rookie substitute Miguel Sano, who pulled a two-nest run to the left of the right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a levelling runner in second base, VerHagen got Trevor Plouffe to score a double goal.
It was the 27th time this season that Plouffe won a doubles game.
After Detroit had secured a safety run at the start of the ninth race, Mauer pulled two beats against Tigers shutterman Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sano in three passes in his fifth rescue.
In the beginning, Detroit took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
The Tigers made three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the injured list before the game after being off for more than a month due to lower back inflammation.
"It's obvious that I didn't want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I was able to make some nice passes in the third inning."
After Hughes grabbed the starting batter to the first base, he let the second base player, Ian Kinsler, move forward one in between.
The right-hand J.D. Martinez's walk in a two-fire situation brought Victor Martinez to the batter's turn, who took himself in the midfield to the first base and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 tube with the runners in good running positions.
Nick Castellanos continued to hit the right and cause a second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned as he attempted to advance to the third base.
The Tigers continued in the second inning and got one shot, two shots from James McCann, and two shots, one shot from Anthony Gos, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important hit," Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right place.
Hughes began to pass and fed the third inning of the non-running team, after which he was replaced by A.J. Achter, a right-handed follower.
Hughes was counted for three runs out of six strokes and a walk with four fires.
NOTE: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was thrown away due to a shoulder stretch.
He was examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder twitch, but was due to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris's stats for the Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was replaced by him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to a contraction of the right oblique abdominal muscle.
The Tigers and Twins series of three games ends Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) takes on Minnesota's right-hand pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for greater openness of the economy to the world
The economy needs to open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering the reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and to developing a policy of transparency," he said at the 16th meeting of the group leading the deepening of the general reform.
Supporting openness at the same time as pushing forward reforms will add new momentum and vitality, and create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Executive Board approved a series of guidelines, including a negative list restricting market access, a relaxation of border control principles, a call for state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a review of the tenant registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created, identifying the sectors and companies in which investment is not allowed.
The system is gradually being tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This change is significant, as it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensure a legal business environment and make the market more transparent.
The government also loosens its control over the power it distributes to companies, thereby ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to conduct their business.
The opinion also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
More sectors will be opened up to private financiers in order to open up state-controlled sectors.
“The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent resident permits for foreigners, the "green card", is facilitated by optimising the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The issue of guaranteeing the professional rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement published after the meeting.
