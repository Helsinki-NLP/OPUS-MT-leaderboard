Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they may look like Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have been stunned by the recommendation to change their job title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The theme originated in the plan to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political tendencies in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour member of the National Assembly said his groupmates were concerned because it rhymes with “Twp and Pwp.”
To explain to readers outside Wales: the Welsh word daft means nappy and pwp means poop.
The board member said the group as a whole was "not happy" and had proposed other names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was “responsive” to the name change, but noted that the word “MWP” is very similar to “Muppet.”
In Welsh, the pronunciation of the letter w is similar to the pronunciation of Yorkshire's English u.
The National Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a bill on the name change, said: “The final decision on all names by which members of the National Assembly are invited, of course, is made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 granted the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public survey on the name proposals, which broadly supported the idea of renamed the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it came to the titles of Members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name “Wales Members of Parliament or WMP,” but the public survey respondents were most in favour of the “MWP” option.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement could be a challenge for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill on the amendments in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the deprivation of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the nomination of the members of the National Assembly shall remain with the members themselves during the deliberation of the legislative act.
Macedonians to hold referendum on changing country’s name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country as the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to this territory and has repeatedly raised objections to its candidacy for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against a referendum on the name change, has said he intends to ignore the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, say the change of name is only the price the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent as the churches of Harlem are struggling
“The older people I’ve talked to have said that there was once a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There is no longer either.”
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People communicate differently these days,” he said.
“Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people stay every day.”
As far as the churches are concerned, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for as long as the leaders hope, and “sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.”
Adams added that churches can be replaced with apartment buildings with apartments filled with people who do not reach out to the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he added, "who will therefore speed up the day when all these churches close their doors, since it is unlikely that the majority of those who live here will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – The Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, the St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The Black congregation, who had worshiped nearby, took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was occupied by a congregation of African-Americans led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of shoppers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, when they refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was severely damaged by the fire in 1939, but when members of Father Johnson's church planned to restore the building, they adopted a carillon, or clockwork.
Father Johnson’s son and heir to office at St Martin’s Church, Reverend David Johnson proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July gave it a different name: “cultural value” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, continued to play a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church didn't replace him.
What has been played in St. Martin's Church in recent months has been the story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by secular church leaders, others by the diocese.
In July, the presiding body of the church, a body of secular leaders, complained to the bishopric in writing that the bishopric was “trying to pass on the costs”, although the presiding body was not even involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the bishopric.
Some members of the association complained about the lack of transparency in the actions of the bishopric.
13-year-old boy injured by shark after lobster dive in California
Authorities say a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark who dived for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and then swam in with the others to help pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for the lobster, but “then he realized that the boy was screaming, ‘I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
His entire skull was bare," Hammel described the sight he saw when he reached the boy.
“I told everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
A life-threatening boy was taken by plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of the shark that was attacked is not yet known.
Lifeguard and Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that the sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was then determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were at the top of the body.
Authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, from Casabladi to Swam, for research and safety purposes.
Giles added that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to take over UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s takes over the chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, creating supermarket-like beauty aisles with expert advisors.
As part of a significant breakthrough into the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.7 billion beauty market, which continues to rise as sales of fashion and household goods decline, the wider ranges of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, bringing them to other stores next year if successful.
The reason for investing in beauty products is that supermarkets are looking for ways to take advantage of the shelf space previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said it plans to double its range of beauty products to 3,000, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Existing product ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also be given more space in brand areas such as those currently found in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its makeup line Boutique, in which the majority of products are suitable for vegans, as young shoppers are demanding more and more.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer, is testing exclusivity licenses at two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second of which will open this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and switching to buying small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means supermarkets need to strive more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury, said the outlets are becoming more and more similar to supermarkets as the chain of supermarkets seeks to combat low-cost chains such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
At Sainsbury, Argos has put its outlets in hundreds of stores. The same has been done with Habitats outlets since Sainsbury bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly supported food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
An earlier attempt by the supermarket to upgrade its beauty and medical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but this ended in a dispute over how to share the proceeds from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was devised after Sainsbury sold its 281 sons for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy trading chain, three years ago.
Lloyds also plays a role in the strategy by adding luxury skincare products to its four store product ranges, including from brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Business Director at Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to improve the environment around our customers.
We have also spent money on specially trained employees who are always ready to advise.
Our brand selection meets every need, but the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a competitive beauty destination that can change old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby canceled <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Deni star Peter Jones left out of “savage anger” when TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal in her lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby lacks time for the homeware and clothing brand Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop.
The 37-year-old director of the TV show This Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Deni star Peter Jones furious, stepping out of their luxury lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was “savage” when a television star admitted at a tense meeting held Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlows Buckinghamshire that his new contracts worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million meant that she no longer had enough time to devote herself to the home apparel and clothing brand “Truly.”
The business has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s main preference.
This was supposed to secure her longer-term future, so she thought she’d be dealing with it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everyone in complete amazement.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to launching the product line.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the departure of one of the UK’s most-paid celebrities, the head of the TV show “This Morning”, could cost the company millions, because a hefty amount of money has been invested in products ranging from sofas and candles to clothes and household clothes.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the brand in March.
The couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby becomes M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin on the ITV series I'm A Celebrity.
One of Jones’ close sources said last night, “I don’t want to comment on his business.”
A difficult conversation, “after what we fell in love with”
Trump joked about the criticism he received in the news for commenting that some consider “unworthy of the president” and for being too positive about North Korea’s leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his scornful “newsman’s voice”:
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear cessation.
However, the talks on nuclear disarmament have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "corresponding reaction" by the US to the initial steps of North Korea's disarmament.
The United States will continue to impose pressure on the country in the future.
Trump’s cheerleading viewpoint was much more lively.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Everything is going very well between us now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought good results: missile tests have been completed, hostages have been helped to be released, and arrangements have been made for the repatriation of the remains of American servants.
He also defended his unusual relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside to get into this stuffed stadium, it’s better if we have around 200 people here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Indonesian Island, Killing Hundreds
Foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help in dealing with the consequences of the Lombok earthquake.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared, which is a precondition for international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international help, so the stories are a little complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to go to Palus, it is not yet clear whether foreigners will be able to work in the area.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities will assess the situation in Palu in order to decide whether international agencies will be allowed to contribute.
Considering the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly unprepared to deal with natural forces.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh from the tsunami, they are not particularly common in other coastal areas.
Although the tsunami was warned, the apparent absence of the tsunami warning siren in Palu likely increased the number of deaths.
Travelling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is also quite challenging at the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stopped in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it takes at least three days to arrive at the new site.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia’s fragmented infrastructure a central part of his election campaign and has distributed the money on roads and railways.
Budget deficits are, however, a threat to Mr Joko's government, as new elections are set to take place next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from the tensions in Indonesia among the chauvinists, where members of the majority Muslim community have turned to a more old-fashioned form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes due to fighting in the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge scores a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by slashing the score in the 89th minute of the game at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqir, being about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal, while his team led 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting it towards the far side of the pole.
The ball flew high over the penalty area and hit the upper right corner of the net.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get this position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq are passing the ball as much as possible, so I was just trying to win as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, I took a touch, and I gave a quick shot.”
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1-0 thanks to a goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this game, the Blues striker flew the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before turning around in the midfield and hitting Liverpool's side.
Kovacic gave a quick pass in the midfield.
Then he created a beautiful air-fed, leading Hazard to the penitentiary.
Hazard overcame the defense and scored the ball with his left foot towards the net with a pole away from Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play with Naples in the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in a UEFA Euroleague game on Thursday at 3 pm in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
A number of people were trapped under the wreckage of buildings collapsed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that caused the 18-metre tsunami on Friday, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
With a population of over 380,000, the city of Palu was buried beneath the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man after stabbed to death
The murder investigation began after the body was found this morning in Merseyside, Birkenhead.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. on John Street in Grayson Mews.
Police are calling to contact people who have moved in the area who may have seen or heard something.
Police inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is just beginning, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers whose on-board cameras may have recorded something, to contact us, as they may have information that is vital to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found in one of the buildings was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, alleged friends of the woman came to the scene and asked questions about where the woman was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police said they are reporting the matter to the woman's immediate relatives.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but police told him that no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was shocked to hear about the incident.
The residents were told it might take hours to get back into the house.
A police officer reportedly told one man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was in tears at the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s horrible.”
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police buses were still in the closed area and the third one was right next to it.
A number of police officers stood in the area and watched the apartment building.
Anyone with information about the event will be asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 using the keyword September 30 log 247.
Parliament's Cromwell statue is the last monument to the cause of the "rewriting of history" controversy
Eliminating it would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects in the Taliban’s style by the man’s inhumane devotees.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's recommendation as nonsense and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was impossible for Oliver Cromwell to remain inviolable from the memorial in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not sack the pictures himself in the English Civil War, nor did he order others to do so.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell man's ancestor Thomas was sacrificed for the actions of the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s excellent presentation of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a person whom many people believe should still be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people, rather at the end of the 19th century than today, considered Cromwell’s parliament to be defended by external pressure and, in this case, by royal power.
Whether this is an accurate reflection is an endless historical debate.
What is certain is that the quarrel of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer kills Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked in a market in southwest China by a pig that killed a man.
The man, identified as Yuan only, was found dead with a wounded artery and covered in blood near the pork market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, South China newspaper Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, Qinghai, China, prepared to vaccinate pigs in his stable.
He allegedly came with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the man’s cousin found him dead and found that the pork beside him was open.
He said the pig was a big, bloody-mouthed snail.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 249.47 kg large hive had reportedly killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were all bloody and shattered,” Wu’s nephew told Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market Thursday morning at 04:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he could not attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are allegedly discussing compensation for the man's death.
Although rare, it has also been previously observed that pigs attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294,83 kilograms was nailed to a Welsh farmer’s tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
When a farmer in Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs usually don’t attack, but that the taste of blood could make their heads burn.
“They’re just playful.
They are very inquisitive maracas, whose goal is not to hurt.
“You just have to respect them enough,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's afterwinds bring massive rainfall to the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves across Mexico’s northern coast to cooler waters.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring flooding rainstorms to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
At 5 p.m. east coast time on Sunday, Rosa was classified as a Category 1 hurricane with winds blowing at 136.78 kilometers per hour, set 619.59 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure zone begins to form, moving eastwards towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula in a tropical storm on Monday, it begins to channel deep tropical moisture towards the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains up to 25.4 centimeters.
Tropical humidity, which reacts with the approaching low-pressure region, will then cause large-scale heavy rainfall in the south-west of the country in the coming days.
At times, rain falling between 2.54 and 10.16 centimetres causes dangerous sudden floods, floodwaters and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfall to increase to five to about seven and a half centimeters per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5.08 to 10.16 centimetres is also expected in certain parts of the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible due to the dispersion of tropical rains with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Be sure not to walk in the desert with the risk of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to turn into fast-flowing rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by outbursts of wind and volatile dust.
The approaching low-pressure temperatures sometimes lead to heavy rainfall along the coast of Southern California.
It is possible to have total precipitation of more than 1.27 centimetres and can cause smaller floodwaters and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Scattered tropical rainfall begins approaching Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, with rainfall becoming widespread on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rains reach the Four Corner on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, the U.S. is forecasting large temperature fluctuations due to Arctic cooling, while temperatures in tropical areas remain high.
Sometimes this leads to large temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday’s weather is an excellent example of significant temperature differences in the central United States.
Temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), range from almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, he will try to regain a long summer heat.
A large portion of the central and eastern United States is expected to begin warm October with temperatures of around 80 degrees Celsius, ranging from the southern plains to the northeastern part of the country.
New York is expected to have 26.6 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that high average temperatures are likely to occur in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was watched by over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched six TV channels on Thursday to hear the gripping confessions of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who allegedly accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political deadlock continued, where broadcasters interrupted regular broadcasts to reflect Friday’s last-minute turnaround: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drafted a contract with the FBI to hold a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed her drunk and tried to rip her clothes off at a high school graduation party.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
According to the Nielsen report, over 20.4 million people watched the broadcast on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels that display it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble counting the number of people viewing transfers at the authorities.
For comparison, this is about the same audience as a football finalist or an Oscar-winning event.
Fox News Channel opinion leaders, who have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in a full-day session, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
There was also a lot of interest after the trial.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught the man on Friday morning after he was caught in a defamation by protesters trying to take the elevator to a legal committee meeting.
He stood on the ground for several minutes when he was accused and it was broadcast directly on CNN.
"I'm standing right here, in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are completely powerless.”
Flake said his department had issued a statement and added before the elevator was closed that he had more to say at the meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered the live broadcast several hours later, when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote to forward Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary for voting.
But Flake said he would only do it in the understanding that the FBI will investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by a conversation with his Democrat friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had an impact because it was obvious that the Republicans would not get Kavanaugh's votes together without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of political play
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the Prime Minister accused those criticising his plans to leave the European Union of “a political game” with Britain’s future and damaging national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the newspaper, which featured Theresa May on the cover with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pressed his attack on May’s so-called Brexit leap plan, saying the proposal on the basis of which Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs was “absolutely brainless.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrested Dyteon Simpson for Murder of LSU Player
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and put in prison on second-degree murder charges, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of Sims' and Simpson's opposition, and police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA, according to CBS's WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer said his bail was set at <0x24>350,000 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308.600.30).
The East Baton Rouge coroner released a preliminary report on Friday that said a gunshot wound to the neck caused the death.
The police department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Operations Team, the State Police forensics lab, the Southern University police, and people living in the area for their help in the investigation that led to the suspect’s arrest.
LSU sports manager Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement in the area for “setting up care and justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-foot man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in the LSU.
The average of his games last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the entire team was “beaten” and “in shock” by Wayde’s death.
"That's something you're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash over Mexico City
The ash erupting from a volcano called Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost districts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, as activity in the crater resumed, resulting in 183 cases of gas emissions and ash discharges recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched a number of rumblings and tremors.
Pictures shared on social media depicted ash-covered car windshields in various districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Catalonian separatists clash with police ahead of independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after a clash between pro-independence protesters and the riot police. Thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to celebrate Catalonia's opposing vote on the withdrawal.
A group of disguised separatist fighters, held back by the riot police, attacked the last with eggs and powder coating, creating thick dust clouds on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
The fighting also occurred later, when the police had to use sticks to control the fights.
For several hours, pro-independence supporters who sang “No Forgiveness, No Forgiveness” clashed with pro-unity demonstrators who shouted “Long live Spain!”
According to the local press, 14 people with minor injuries received medical care during the demonstration.
Tensions continue to rise in the pro-independence region a year later, when Madrid declared the 1 October referendum illegal, but was still celebrated by the Catalans in favour of secession.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although the turnout was low, as those who were against the withdrawal largely ignored the vote.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to obstruct a vote in front of voting districts across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
Pro-independence activists had spent the night in front of the polling stations on Friday to avoid demonstrations in support of the national police.
There were demonstrations, but they had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of seeing Catalonia as an independent country.
“Last year was one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying over the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite an important but small victory in the regional elections held in December last year, it has been difficult for the parties supporting Catalan independence to maintain their will to act this year, as a number of the most prominent leaders have either gone into exile themselves or have been detained and are awaiting trial for their role in the holding of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who records a demonstration to support the police with his mobile phone, said the controversy was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since last year, announced that he would participate in the European elections next year.
“Candidates for the European elections are the best way to condemn the withdrawal of democratic values and the pressures of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Car Rammed House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the house was repeatedly rammed by a car in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blommings said the damage was done to the gates and the building.
A bow arrow could also be fired at some point towards the car.
Menga strike gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston wins
Livingston pushed the Rangers to take Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games in which he has been the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard will be unsuccessful in the first league this season and face the leading Hearts next Sunday, with eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Euroleague.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his invincible attack to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt the taste of loss since Kenny Miler was replaced last month.
Livingston loses a chance against blunt visitors
Holt’s team should have led long before the goal was scored, as their straight-forward style of play caused Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts stagnated in front of the goal, where Alan Lithgow made an effort to hit Craig Halkett over the goal.
The hosts calmly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the guests in certain places.
And this is also the way the decisive gate was struck.
The Rangers gave up the free shot, and Livingston had the opportunity to play the schematics of Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and managed to do so from the center of the penalty area.
By this time, the Rangers had mainly mastered the ball, but could not penetrate the defense, so the goalkeeper Liam Kelly's side was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the goal once.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor repelled Scott Pittman's blow, and Lithgow shone brightly in Livingston's new teamwork.
Two penalty shots were also sent away, one for attempting to replace Halkett's Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
A Phenomenal Achievement from Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaron Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was great, completely exceeding expectations when moving up the ladder.
Their style of play and players have hardly changed since they returned to the top, but Holt has to be honored for the way he has tempered the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, organizing a perfectly organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their backs throughout the game.
The Rangers were inspired.
In spite of their in-between good standing under Gerrard’s leadership, this was not enough, according to the examples here.
Their last possession of the ball turned out to be flawed: reaching home only once could serve as an alarm clock for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan's controversial reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) there were both smiles and clouds of concern in Berlin when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been sidelined on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
Police referred to security, forbidding the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters showed up near it to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of whom are Kurds, also voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to host the Turkish president in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show that the attitude towards the guest is divided: some Turks in Germany greet him as a hero, while others despise him as an autocrat.
Road accident on Deptford Road: cyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist killed in a car crash in London.
The collision took place on a high-speed road near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped and the ambulance came to provide help, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from the Saturday crash site, where the driver who hit the cyclist escaped the scene.
London police said authorities were working on identifying the man and informing his loved ones.
Traffic at the event is closed and buses are redirected, motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prison Officials Injured
The prison authorities said six prison officials were injured in riots in a highly secure men's prison.
The riots broke out at His Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9:30 p.m., British Summer Time, and have not yet ended.
Expert riot police officers have been involved in the riots in one wing, involving eight prisoners.
Prison officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison workers are invited to resolve the ongoing case at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible will be handed over to the police and their prison sentences may be extended.”
There are more than 500 inmates in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was taken to hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, however, the riot police were called to prison to quiet down serious riots in which prison officials were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with floods (hurricane may be beneficial for drought areas)
Tropical low pressures don’t hit Arizona often, but it’s likely to happen early next week as sluggish hurricane Rosa moves across the desert to the southwest of the United States, bringing with it the risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already organized surveillance of the sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, California and southeastern Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area with rainfall as early as Monday.
Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted: “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low-pressure levels within a radius of 321.86 kilometres from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64.37 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall from 5.08 to 10.16 centimetres, which can reach up to 15.24 centimetres in confined areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other desert areas in the U.S., including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Cousin, are likely to have precipitation of between 2.54 and 5.08 centimetres, reaching up to 10.16 centimetres in confined areas.
In areas that are resistant to sudden floods, Rosa’s rainfall can be a blessing, as the area suffers from drought.
While floods are very worrying, such rainfall is also likely to be beneficial because of the drought in Southwest America.
According to a U.S. drought monitor, at least 40 percent of Arizona’s population is affected by extreme drought, the second-largest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa Baja crosses the California peninsula on the Mexican mainland.
Rosa, which was still at hurricane level on Sunday morning with the largest wind speeds of 6.43 kilometers per hour, is now 619.95 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 kilometers per hour north.
The storm comes into contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean and, as a result, subsides slightly.
Thus, Rosa is expected to reach the Mexican mainland with the intensity of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The amount of precipitation in certain areas of Mexico can be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwestern part of Sonora, we can expect rainfall of between 7.62 and 15.24 centimetres, sometimes up to 25.4 centimetres,” weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa then heads over Mexico in a tropical storm northwards, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low-pressure zone that moves across Arizona and arrives in southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The main threat that follows Rosa or its aftermath is very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora, and the desert in the southwestern part of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests Linked to Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of premeditated murder after a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.
The victim was taken to hospital in “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have cell phone records of the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered” Democratic Party under “evil and hatred”
"Supporting Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's ruthless and unacceptable tactics," Trump said in a cheerleading speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered” during the Democratic Party’s nomination process “under the guise of evil and hatred.”
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, harshly and emotionally rejecting Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations that she had been attacked by a man several decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also testified about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “America saw Kavanaugh’s glory, quality and courage on that day.”
The vote given for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the most valued lawyers of our time, with an impeccable background in public service,” he said.
The President implicitly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while at the same time talking about the importance of the Republic's electoral turnout in the mid-term elections.
“Five weeks remain until one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m running,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission to “resist and prevent.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s candidacy in the Senate is expected to take place no later than Friday, Republican party leaders’ senior aide told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami kill thousands in Indonesia, death toll rises
At least 384 people died and many were washed away as tsunamis hit the beach after a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palu on Friday, when six-metre waves hit the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that was left on the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still doing their thing on the beach, not fleeing immediately, thus remaining the victims,” Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency’s BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, but took cars, logs and houses with it, sweeping everything from the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h on the high seas before reaching shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to the Palu 24 centre.
Aerial photographs published by the Disaster Management Board showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and mosques surrounded by water.
The coastline continued on Saturday.
With a population of 2.4 million, the region was experiencing a wave of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Implementation of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released on Friday after a strong earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than that released by a nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city on the edge of a long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami, BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found beneath the wreckage of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of deaths and damage could be greater in a coastal area 300 km north of Palu called Donggala, which was closer to the center of the earthquake.
Reports from Donggaa “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information,” Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the region,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its crew and volunteers are heading for the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy that could get worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami in the town of Palu, although authorities said the waves reached the beach at the same time as the warning was issued.
Amateur footage on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building, who panickedly warns people moving down the street of an approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, the water wall arrives at the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the accuracy of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large-scale power outage, which prevented communication in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to organise rescue operations.
The military has started sending out transport planes from Jakarta and other cities to help, authorities said, but the evacuators still urgently need food and other basic supplies.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue work, otherwise remaining closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of deaths due to the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
That's very bad.
While World Vision workers from Donggala safely reached the town of Palu, where they are sheltered in the display tents erected in their office yards, they saw devastating sightings on their way, Mr Doseba said.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he said.
That's very bad.
Although the reinforcements started vigorously to alleviate the disaster, some complained that the employees of foreign aid organisations with extensive experience were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian rules, foreign funding, supplies and reinforcements can only be deployed if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This continues to be a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arrian, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘Okay, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start accepting international aid, but such a state has not yet been declared.”
When the second night of Palus arrived after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing people were still full of hope that their loved ones would be the miraculous events that alleviate the gloom of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was lifted out of the sewer pit.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble next to her mother’s body for two days.
Indonesian national paratrooper coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
The rest of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel are his students, Mr Mandagi added.
“As a senior paraglider, I have a personal burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon talked about how, after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the glider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Ask competitors who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with only one gray bird instead of two blue birds.
"I think that means the messages didn't get through," he said.
The thieves took <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,585.88 while filling the ATM at Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, the thieves stole <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,585.88 from Brink's employee who filled the Newport on the Levees ATM, a Newport police station press release said.
The driver emptied the ATM at the entertainment facility and prepared to bring in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
When the man acted, “another man ran behind Brink’s employee” and stole a delivery bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, a press release said, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on theft is asked to contact the Newport Police on (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper takes his new name Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted: “Former Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time now, and he also used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change will take place before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her concert "in the spirit of feelings," the show's author said.
In addition to being an abbreviation for the man’s current performer name, West has previously said that it is a word of religious importance to him.
“I think ‘ye’ is one of the most widely used words in the Bible, which means ‘you,’” West said earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
I changed my name from Kanye, which means “that one,” to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion, and everything else.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye West isn’t the only rapper to play by his name.
Sean Combs is mainly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, who has previously worked with West, has also used his name with and without a dash of thought, in capital letters and lowercase letters.
Mexican politician AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador said on Sunday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use an army to curb Mexicans.”
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking hold across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying students monthly grants and opening more free state universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its funding for research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI specialist who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were published after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. has no formal AI strategy in general.
At the same time, last year, China announced its plan to be a key player in the innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are working towards the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double funding would double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat America's best Othello player. Later, he was a man on the board of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the next dreamers.
“U.S. scientists need to work hard to get government funding,” Lee said.
“China is not the one taking over the intellectuals, it is the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policies could help the US support artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think people who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered a green card," he said.
The China State Council published the next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
“The National Science Foundation of China distributes funding to people working in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a combined AI center to engage partners from industry and educational institutions, while the White House announced the formation of a committee elected by AI.
This month, DARPA announced it was starting to fund the <0x24>2 million AI Next initiative.
But the National Science Fund is currently funding more than <0x24>100 million a year for artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been amended.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would also resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from confirming its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on that territory and has prohibited Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on a new name for Macedonia, but nationalist opponents argue that the name would undermine the national identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he did not intend to participate in the referendum and that the campaign of disregard has raised doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the 50% turnout required for the referendum to be valid.
“Do you support Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to secure membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority of the Parliament is required to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their vote on 30 September 2018 in a referendum in Strumica to change the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising a chair in front of the tents for those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the door of the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and get Europe-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia with a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that a large majority is in favour of changing the name, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of membership in the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that “yes” would be “a confirmation of our future.”
The results of a poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies revealed that 30 to 43 percent of voters intend to take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to a survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would say yes.
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the government's Western policy since the government took over in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through all of Brighton’s defenses for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defense, securing Manchester City a 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero gave the impression that the goal he scored in the 65th minute of the game was ridiculously easy.
The Argentine attacker crossed the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He penetrated three defenders of Brighton before reaching the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another defender before running past several players on the border of Brighton Penalty Area.
He then hit the ball to his left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used the first blow to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a blow to the right side of the net.
“Aguero has a leg problem,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he’d play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
“We were lucky to get him in that moment.”
However, Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an initial lead in the Premier League fight.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in Brighton territory.
He sent the ball nicely to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane scored the ball a few times before leading Sterling further.
The Sky Blues pushed the ball forward into the net just before it slipped out of the boundary.
Manchester City will play in the Champions League with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the cheerleader against the Rockies
When the Nationals missed the finals, there was no good reason to start again.
Scherzer hopes to knock down the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockies, who heads the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West in one game, still has hope of making it to the final.
With a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies guaranteed at least a Joker's seat, but the team still wants to secure its first division status.
“While we’re not playing for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in Denver with this audience and the other team is probably at a higher level than any other game I can expect this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete here?”
The Nationals have yet to name the opening match on Sunday, but are supposed to be inclined toward Scherzer's pass in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th feed, made a warm-up on Thursday and baited as usual on Sunday.
This Washington right-handed player will lead 18–7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of layoffs is 300, and favorable odds are 220 2/3 this season.
Trump gives a cheerleading speech in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court, while at the same time talking about the importance of the Republic's election turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
It’s a big event, I’m not running, but I’m actually running, which is why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely terrible, extremist group of Democrats. You see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they're determined to take back the power by any means necessary. You'll see their meanness and filthy play.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over for power and control, all they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give them that."
The Democrats are on a mission to “resist and prevent.”
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hateful, mean, vile, and lying."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was screaming out loud from the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, wait, that was one of the worst body language examples, actually the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a big party.
It is intolerable to those who express their opinion.
When the activists of my local party, Momentum, voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last Labour MEP on the list to be told that you are not welcome, and all for expressing your opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because he was a strong advocate of anti-Jewishism.
In my case, the critics criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are bizarrely similar issues, on which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
The Labour Party of Nottingham East said in a statement: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
For the most part, this is exactly what my eight-year-old local Labour MEP's experience with Friday evening General Assembly meetings is like.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the case for most meetings today, and the promise of being “less generous and more generous” in politics has long been forgotten, if ever it was remembered.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different viewpoints are not acceptable in the Labour Party, and that for each opinion, it is assessed who is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and the co-worker with whom I had previously thought that I would share similar political views was now waiting for me to change my mind and adopt positions that I would otherwise never have accepted, whether it be national security or EU single market issues.
Whenever I speak up publicly, no matter what I actually say, it is followed by condemnation on social media, encouraging my recall, ignoring party politics, and saying that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my co-workers, because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and judgment of those co-workers who face sexist or racist abuse on a daily basis, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing views in this policy area is how levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we are no longer such a big community, and with every initiative of “infidelity” or change in electoral rules, the party becomes narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the past two years to keep my head down, talk less, and “then everything would be fine.”
But that’s not what I came to do in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which had left my large school classroom literally on the verge of collapse, I have tried to speak up for better public services to those who need it most, acting as both a member of the local council and a minister of the government.
I have never concealed my policy, including in the last election.
There is no way that anyone in Nottingham East could have gotten confused about my political views or areas of disagreement with the local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that as the country is heading towards Brexit, which is damaging to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my supporters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat of recall or political consideration will stop me from acting in what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38–17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have tilted the end result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully fun first league game.
They are now the only unmatched team in the top ten of the table.
In the end, it was the high level of team protection and better risk-taking that led to the home team win and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We've been put to the test all the time during the games and we're still invincible, so of course I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “I respect Ayr, they used their opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, which was taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a head start, but the yellow card given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was ceded to the Warriors for the game, gave Melros a chance where Jason Baggot performed a failed trial.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the end of the half, reaching a 17–5 position in Ayr's favour by the end of the half-time with a single event.
But Melrose started the second half successfully, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, taken over by Baggot, narrowed the gap by five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was taken away on the stretcher. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead even further thanks to Stafford McDowall's attempt, which was transmitted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, but once again Melrose's player paid for Bruce Colvine's attempt to fail after heavy pressure.
However, the team playing on the home pitch gained strength again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for blocking Climo without a ball on the penalty line, MacPherson dropped the ball behind the advancing Ayrs.
Climo passed the ball forward, as he did almost immediately after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's boxing shot and sent Gregor Henry away on the fifth try of the team playing on the home pitch.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that the man was appointed director of a respected restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the well-known BBC television series he writes and plays with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is making life after Craiglang’s new plans.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source at Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow’s “blooming restaurant business.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia without sea borders hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags hover over the official buildings.
The slogan for naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is: “The sea is our right.
It is our responsibility to restore it.”
The memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still alive in completely sea-free Bolivia. The same vivid desire is to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and the country is, of course, looking forward to a positive outcome,” Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
A number of Bolivians across the country are watching the decision of the International Court of Justice from the big screens in the hope that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged, after decades of intermittent discussions, to negotiate with Bolivia to give the latter an independent route to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic President Evo Morales, who faces a controversial election battle next year, has a lot at stake in Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, think that the court will probably not vote for Bolivia, or if it did, it would change very little.
The United Nations agency in the Netherlands has no power to surrender Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final statements have been heard indicates that this was not a “complicated case,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an international law expert in Chile.
And moving away from additional causes in Bolivia, the last four years may have worsened the situation.
"The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by the current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales’ warlike eloquence has lost all remaining Chilean goodwill, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all this, the debate will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was unduly urgent.
Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in its relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's best-known presidents, used the maritime issue to express political resentment.
“Bolivia will never waive its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says it won’t release nuclear weapons until it can’t trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never give up nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to reconsider the promises that rival leaders made to each other during the Singapore Summit.
He commented at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be resuming nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
According to Ri, these are air castles, he believes that the continued US restrictions and the refusal to declare an end to the war with Korea will make North Korea surrender.
Washington is cautious about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the weaponry that the state is likely to see as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Bring the Viewer a Series of Massive Headwear Bringed to Buyers on the Shopping Streets in Their Neighborhood
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you no longer need to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of bizarre super big headgear to the stage during their 2019 summer season, which dazzled Paris Fashion Week.
High and impractical hats are in fashion this summer via Instagram and these designers have sent their stunning creations to the fashion scenes.
Valentino’s top work was an overstretched beige hat that covered the models’ heads and was decorated with a feather-like wide border.
Other extraordinarily large items of clothing included watermelons decorated with jewels, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple, but their purpose is not to insulate the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange selection of masks, doing it just in time for Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had a sewn-up mouth, so they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One part of the creation resembled a diving suit with air tube and glasses, while the other resembled a melted ice cream extract.
And if you continue with the gigantic fashion stunts, you're in luck.
Fashion makers predict that super-large headgear can reach shopping streets near you.
The super-large hats immediately follow La Bomba, a 60-centimeter-wide straw hat seen on the heads of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that created a largely impractical hat on social media sent another great piece to the fashion scene – a straw-shaped beach bag that is almost as big as the bikini model that wears it.
The dark orange raffia bag with its raffia fringes and white leather straps was the highlight of the 2019 summer collection of the Jacquemus La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags on the shopping streets next summer. Since the designer has exerted such a great influence, it would be hard to ignore the demand for super-large items of clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are important for global citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the top of the rankings for academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and collective success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, with more than 30,000 students across Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and their parents.
The purpose of private schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a curriculum tailored to the circumstances, we see that modern languages continue to be well-known and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it comes to his mind.
When you speak to him in his native language, it reaches his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s fresh exam results, we can see that at the top of the tables are the languages with the highest pass rate among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high score of A.
Data collected from a total of 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students scored A in Mandarin, 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as essential skills for life, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages that are now among the subject choices are in the curricula of private schools and other schools in the same way as STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that 17% of respondents reported a lack of language skills among the reasons why employers find it difficult to find workers for vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future work.
As more promising job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming indispensable in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice made, acquiring a second language gives a person a real advantage in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign nationals gives a multilingual person an immediate competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents do not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation about it. The only language with a two-digit proficiency rate was French with 15 percent.
Therefore, funding for language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of emerging economies, gives children better opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
A number of schools focus more on classical modern languages, while other schools teach the languages considered to be the most important in the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interests, private schools always have the option to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future may bring them.
It can no longer be denied that, in a globalised business environment, languages are crucial for the future of a country, which is why this must also be reflected in education.
It is the modern languages that really should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Private schools continue to provide young Scots with choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
Avid fans no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut in the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, the number of minutes of play still needs to be determined.
"It's over one and under 48," Walton Lakers said on his official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a number of minutes.
After training last week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-player preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to warm up,” he said.
Trump West Virginia Election Campaign Event, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will start his campaign series tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of five campaign events planned for next week, including stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the approval vote is pending until Trump elects whom to nominate for a vacant Supreme Court seat, he will seek to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s campaign event in West Virginia, and how to watch it online?
The Trump campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday evening, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. East Coast time.
Trump’s West Virginia campaign event can be watched online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is probably talking about the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings this week that became tense due to allegations of sexual misconduct. At the same time, the Senate approval vote has been suspended for a week while the FBI investigates the matter.
But the main purpose of the campaign events series is to help relaunch Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign manager said that the goal of these five events next week is to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and extend their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Controlling the congress is so important to the president’s agenda that Trump will dive into the fast-paced election campaign season in as many states as possible,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s campaign event, scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, could bring in supporters “from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage in the Pittsburgh media,” West Virginia Metro News reported.
This is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia, who leads the rankings according to polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has come to stimulate his performance,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team has a nerve to compete, keeping hopes high ahead of Sunday’s singles games
After three one-sided sessions, the games on Saturday afternoon were perhaps just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging turning point pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sports, but players truly believe in it, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do they think the turning point would be now?
"They led with six points, which have now become four, so I think I can see this as a small turning point," said Jordan Spieth.
Europe has an advantage, that is clear, because it is led by four points and there are 12 more points at stake.
According to Spieth, Americans feel they don’t have enough wind in the sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four.
Spieth has been impressive in both the tee and the green and has set an example.
These rings of victory from the throat became louder and louder with each round, overshadowing the determining put, which would have led to a fourth match draw after he and Thomas were down with two.
His putti, which won the match on the 15th, sent out a similar cry, demonstrating the man's belief that the Americans were not out of the race yet.
“You just have to be more focused and worry about your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players can do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points after the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are the undisputed Ryder Cup stars Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe’s strange but beloved couple is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who didn’t hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game, and the way their energy flows into and out of such a noisy crowd, reinforces the belief that the players they will be competing with on Sunday, and that when the sun sets across Le Golf National, there will be no better known player to confirm a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably in different holes at the same time.
However, the talks about the glory of Europe are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job with Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero this morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the two doubles in the first nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one to help you out.
Four-balls and doubles are extremely attractive to watch closely, especially because of the interaction between couples, the advice given to each other, the lack of advice and how the way can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a strong lead for the last day, but this quadrennial session showed that the US team has the nerve to fight, which some, especially Americans, have doubted.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup 10-6 on the last day
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will be ahead of the United States 10–6 after Saturday’s four-ball and doubles.
The excellent duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories in front of the struggling Tiger Woods to raise their current score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side, who bet on keeping the trophy he lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated the American side in the morning four-ball, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the doubles, winning two games, but they failed to make up for the shortfall.
Jim Furyk's half of Sunday's 12 singles will need eight points to hold the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. Together with Molinar, who is called Molliwood after this pleasant weekend, they are the second pair to have won four points in their fourth opening game in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After destroying four-ball Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeauveel more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random glow, but has now lost his 29 four-ball and 19 doubles, scoring seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested four-ball in the morning, returned to doubles with partner Henrik Stenson, defeating 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is ranked first and third in the world rankings.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held in pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a two-point benchmark for Americans on Saturday.
They won 2–1 in four-ball over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, returning later and defeating Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in doubles after losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team come back from a four-point deficit, going into singles, although as owners, Furyki only needs a draw to maintain half the cup.
Although two days in second place, after the counterattack on Sunday, it seems like they won’t succeed.
North Korea says “no way” they will not disarm themselves unilaterally because of a lack of trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued restrictions had aggravated their distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Organisation's annual meeting that North Korea had taken "significant benevolent measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see that the United States has responded," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, our country has no security and under such circumstances we are in no way willing to disarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s “phasing-in” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea will be rewarded if it takes step-by-step steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject a unilateral renunciation of nuclear weapons, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to move towards “no nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula” and Trump pledged security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has called for an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
“The U.S. demands, first of all, the abandonment of nuclear weapons and increases the pressure on the restrictions to achieve their goal forcibly, even in opposition to the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that restrictions are pushing us to our knees is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continuing restrictions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader underlined earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted the meeting between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea were one of the parties to the issue of nuclear weapons, and not the United States, the issue of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock.”
However, Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s when he told the United Nations General Assembly that a North Korean missile approach to the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but added that there is still much to be done and that the restrictions must remain in place until North Korea’s nuclear weapons are disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a schedule for it, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that “the enforcement of the UN Security Council’s restrictions must continue forcefully and unsuccessfully until we can fully and definitively confirm the withdrawal of nuclear weapons.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions on North Korea in an attempt to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Riga on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After a meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him within just a few hours for “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea pledged to dismantle the missiles and nuclear complex at its meeting with Moon this month if the United States took “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that by “appropriate measures” he meant Trump’s security guarantees in Singapore and moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University is offering a new course where students need more sleep to fight a growing aggressive culture of learning through caffeinated night-long learning marathons.
Students who love the academicity of the world’s best university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of taking care of themselves.
According to the designer of this course, Brigham, a sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School, and Charles Czeisler, an expert professor at Women’s Hospital, this is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired by the creation of the course after he gave a speech on how sleep disorders affect learning.
“At the end of it, a girl came up to me and asked, ‘Why is it only now that I am told about this in my final year of school?’
He said that no one had ever told him the importance of sleep — it made me feel bad,” he told the Telegraph.
The course, which first came into the curriculum this year, will explain to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health care at the university, said the university decided to take a course curriculum after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived during their working week.
The hour-long course includes a number of interactional tasks.
A section presents a picture of the dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books, explaining the effects of caffeine and light, how lack of sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of the established practice of going to bed.
The second part explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus, along with its interactional symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler said.
According to him, there is still pride in the nightly learning marathons, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students rather mean that lack of sleep is still a growing problem.
“Ensuring adequate quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety,” he added. “It even helps against weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain into hunger mode, making a person constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
Raymond said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university-wide course.
As a next step, he would like all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set the alarm clock for both going to bed and waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” caused by electronic screens and LED lighting, as this could damage their circadian rhythm and cause problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest game result when Dolly Menga's shot, accompanied by Steven Gerrard from the side, brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
Ibrox had hoped to win his first guest victory since February, when St Johnstone was defeated 4-1, but Gary Holt's team caused only Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as leader, remaining eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga scored his goal seven minutes before the halftime and the Rangers' poor readiness could not recover from it.
The Rangers thus fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place, remaining below Hibernian with just one goal.
For the Rangers, the problems may not be over yet, because their attacker, Calum Spence, needed treatment for the head wound after he was probably hit by a thrown away object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that led to the semi-finals of Ayr and the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went ahead with the same Livi 11 who took a point from the Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with the way his well-trained boys suffocated his opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have been more dominant in the village, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have scored in the second opening minute when Menga’s first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor’s goal, but the quarterback didn’t take his chance.
The deep Keaghan Jacobs free-shot then found Captain Craig Halkett, but its defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-arc blow to the rear pole.
While the Rangers gained control, they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt strongly that he should have been penalized when he collided with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy the Columbia player's complaint.
The Rangers managed to score only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried about either Lassana Coulibaly's head shot or Ovie Ejaria's event.
While Liv’s 34th minute kick may have violated the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performance.
Again, the Rangers were unable to curb Jacobs' deep, difficult performance.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher scored the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose Menga, who just finished the plan.
Gerrard acted in a break, switching from Coulibaly to Ryan Kent. This exchange almost paid off when the wingman split up Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to curb his seat.
But Livingston continued to lure guests to play exactly the type of game that suits them, where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
Holt's side could have promoted his leadership at the final stage, but McGregor stood firm, hindering Jacobs before Lithgow hit the corner with a large arc.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again requested a penalty when he went up with Jacobs, which Thomson once again did not satisfy.
Almanahh: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and LISTENING ... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From this foundation of science, Geiger's counter also became the foundation of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado's Clocks, in which they starred as seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
Wearing these headphones, you can hear the pods of atoms released from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: “Don’t tell me, it’s going to squeeze!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Fraud Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Fraud Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cheating cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying these cells in a laboratory
They can then “see” a common protein for many cancers and are injected back into the body.
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman, who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect fraudulent cells, lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient. These cells are altered in the laboratory so that they can “see” the protein that is common in different types of HER2 cancers, and then injected back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “leads to the growth of many types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which patients are taken immune cells and trained to target cancer cells, has been used in the treatment of some types of leukaemia.
Kanye West started out with a supportive tribe for Trump, wearing a OWN hat on the SNL live show.
It didn't go very well.
You'll be in Saturday Night Live studio with a disparaging whistle-blowing chorus towards Kanye West, after his confusing speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced his candidacy for the same post in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat labeled Make America Great, he began to shout against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so much to white people who ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’”
“If I were so worried about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood celebrity joked about Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford’s alleged sexual assault.
While this episode didn't air, West's noisy footage was uploaded to comedian Chris Rock's social media.
It remains unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with a post.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time with his hat behind the scenes.
“They mocked me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go in there, with a hat on.
They fooled me!
And then they say I'm drowned in a place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see the drowned place? I’m going to put on my Superman cape because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments triggered annoyance on at least two occasions and seemed embarrassing to the SNL team. According to Variety, one person stated: “The whole studio was silent to death.”
West was featured on the show at the last minute as a replacement for Ariana Grande, because her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West astounded many with the song "I Love It," during which time he looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Conservative group TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one brave soul: THANK YOU FOR COURSING TO ANSWER THE POPULATION.”
But TV host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “who he is, and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decided NOT to reward (buying my music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) someone who, in my opinion, believes and spreads a worldview that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, saying he was now “former Kanye West.”
She is not the first singer to change her stage name, following Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Also, rapper Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the recently-divorced music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol.
Charges of attempted murder for stabbing a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballypackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast District Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones celebrity Kit Harington disapproves of fine masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-flashing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor (31) dismisses the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young guys often feel they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought “something went wrong” and raised the question of how to solve the problem of hilarious masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her Game of Thrones co-author Rose Leslie (31), admitted that she “feels pretty strongly” that the problem needs attention.
“I personally feel pretty strongly right now that we’ve gone wrong with masculinity somewhere,” he said.
“What have we taught men as they grow up with regard to the problem we are seeing now?”
Kit believes that the rise in masculinity is partly to blame for the TV show’s superheroes.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they have to be just the way they want to be if they want to be men.
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time - how to change it?
Because obviously something has gone wrong for the young people.”
In the poll, he also admitted that after the end of the series next summer, he would never take part in any of the Game of Thrones sequels, saying that he was “on with his battlefields and horses.”
Since November, Kit has been involved in the revival of Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his robbery brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing about Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose starred in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the beloved of Kit’s character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has jumped to 14%.
According to health professionals, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have arisen from sex, thus changing the past.
HIV was mainly transmitted through blood transfusions in some parts of China .
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is reportedly high.
Because of the country’s old-fashioned values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of diseases are associated with insufficient sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has allowed universal access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking employee GOP senator data, saying it’s “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. spokeswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that her employee had posted the personal data of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are spread by “ultra-right” trolls and their websites.
"Lies, lies, and even more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both from Utah).
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to the Waters office and released membership information for a Waters employee, Hill said.
"This unfounded claim is a complete and absolute lie," Waters said.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and safety are at risk because of their fraudulent and false claims, are in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unfounded assertion is a complete and irrefutable lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly reviewed online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial comes from anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he has a feeling that is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not become angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They have to stay calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s important when it comes to truth,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about their fraudulent allegations.”
“We will do everything we can to find out the criminals,” he continued, “and to make them legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Underestimated Rowan Atkinson's Spy Parody
It is now customary to search for the meanings of Brexit in all new British films, and this seems particularly appropriate for Johnny English's comedy parody series -- which began with Johnny English in 2003 and became a sequel to Johnny English Reborn -- in 2011.
Is it humorous to joke about yourself about how obviously stupid we are in the country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English with a blunt-eyed rubber face has been given permission to do things again in his twisted way – and that this wide comic creation is meant for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it’s a secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretentious smoothie glamour, reminds a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr. Bean, and a little of the character who gave the tone to Chariots of Fire’s hallmark story at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also based on the traveler and international mystery Atkinson, who was once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving only chaos behind.
In this last JE movie, there are only one or two pleasant moments.
I liked the approach to Johnny English's helicopter when he wore medieval armor and the wings of the helicopter whispered him against the helmet for a moment.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor seems insignificant and strangely superfluous, especially when “serious” spy films like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves confidently offer comedy.
It seems that this humor is more for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s cunning adventures aren’t as resourceful and focused as Atkinson’s silent films as Bean.
It is now an eternally current premise that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK’s top-secret spy network, exposing the identities of all UK secret police officers, making a huge disappointment for an on-site agent — a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for the prime minister, a festive and troubled character who suffers from the burden of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this Teresa-May character great, but there’s not much in the script to work on.
His intelligence advisers recommend that since all active spies are at risk, he must recall someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster at one of the proud institutions, giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a couple of good places where English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is flew back to Whitehall for emergency information and he is reunited with his former longtime partner, Bough, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, his majesty's secret service shamings are back in action, reuniting with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletowa, portrayed by Olga Kurolenko.
At the same time, the prime minister falls dangerously under the paw of a charismatic tech-billionaire who claims to be able to solve all of Britain's computer problems: unhappy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their thirsty odyssey: hiding as waitresses, they set fire to the French restaurant; they create chaos by secretly curbing Volta’s luxury yacht aboard; and English triggers a real mess as she tries to use a virtual reality headset to get to know the inside of Volta’s house.
This last section doesn't use any brakes, but as cute and rushed as it is, the whole thing has a children's TV flavor on it.
Pretty mediocre stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I caught myself thinking: Doesn’t the British film industry really have a role to give Rowan Atkinson that’s fair to his talent?
The Labour Party denies drafting a plan in which the British work four days a week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has been considering a groundbreaking plan that would allow the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
The party wants the company’s bosses to pass on the savings from the Artificial Intelligence Revolution (AI) to employees, giving them one more day off.
That way, employees would have a three-day weekend – but they would get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would fit in with the party’s economic agenda, and so it is intended to tilt the state in favor of the workers.
Thursday’s working week has been approved by the Congress of the Trade Union to allow workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a review of the bill will be announced before the end of the year.
“This is not an overnight event, but Thursday’s work week is an endeavor that fits with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as with the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a Thursday work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole does not support this effort at the moment.
A Labour spokesman said: “The Thursday working week is not party policy and the party is not discussing it.”
Undersecretary John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist turnaround in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take back power from the “visible managers” and “profit earners” of utility companies.
The plans of the Undersecretary also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not be able to regain their full shareholding, as the Labour Party could make “deductions” in connection with perceived misdemeanour.
He confirmed his plan to put employees on company boards and create co-ownership funds to provide 10% of the equity capital of private companies to employees, instead of granting annual bonuses of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>561.65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in 60 Minutes about whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
Investigation of the FBI's allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises questions as to whether the Bureau's findings could affect the end of support for Republican senators.
In a poll on Sunday, 60 Minutes co-host Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that might make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I was going to an interrogation. I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came up and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was decisive, confident and unequivocal.”
Graham's voice seems to be rocky.
“I’m confident in my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and that could only be changed in the news,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how this happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And not everyone he named could confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don’t see anything new coming.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the annual New York Global Citizen Festival will host an annual music event with a hugely impressive celebrity participation and an equally impressive goal: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Now, the seventh-time Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park’s Great Lawn area not only enjoying singers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers who hope to end poverty by continuously increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to complete a number of tasks or volunteer activities, send an email to some of the world’s leaders, make a call, or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been if there are 12 more years to reach this goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way of persuading them to insist on action, or is it just another click-and-click gimmick where people feel like they’re doing something important by signing a statement online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “activities” of its supporters, aiming to achieve a number of different goals.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders communicate more than <0x24>37 billion in commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and communications that stem from their activities, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor-implementation partnership that is committed to “helping children make the most of their abilities,” promising to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition into a historical footnote of social injustice,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 actions calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced a funding project, The Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website, it asks, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It’s a long and difficult road – sometimes we fall and fail.
But as we face great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we are confident in our success, because together we will be more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are just a few performers to perform at this year’s event in New York, headed by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use naval “barrier” to prevent Russian energy exports
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington may use its navy if necessary to prevent the Russian energy market from being hit, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has said.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially when it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the stomach of Southern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
“The United States has this opportunity, with the help of our navy, to ensure that shipping lines are open and blocked if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he added.
Zinke's statement was addressed to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that represents the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice between Iran and Russia is more or less leverage and fuel substitution," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with increasing LNG exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to push out the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that Trump said turned Berlin into Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has been hit back by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Association (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem for me if a third country interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she was seriously considering running for president.
At Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes the First Lady," she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren also assessed President Donald Trump’s actions, saying he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has criticized Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters don’t think he should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Research/Boston Globe, 58% of “probable” Massachusetts voters thought the senator should not run.
32% supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy, with 38% in favor of a possible candidacy, and 48% against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin cites PTSD at Donald Trump’s Track Palin rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq following the recruitment in September.
He was arrested Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, I can relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers are coming back,” Trump said.
Palin called his son’s arrest “an elephant in the room” and said in connection with his son and other war veterans that “they will come back a little differently, they will come back in hardened condition, they will come back wondering if there is enough respect for what the soldiers and the airmen and all the other soldiers have given to the country.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence against a woman, interfering in a domestic violence report, and possession of a gun in a state of intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the Columbia Region Controversy New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia region support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that bans asylum for victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 countries and regions made a brief statement by court friends in Washington on Friday to support a challenging policy on asylum seekers, NBC News reported.
The applicant’s full name, Grace v Sessions suitis, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been published.
The woman said her accomplice “and her violent gang members’ sons” abused her, but U.S. officials refused to accept her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala were described as producing large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “has been ignoring national, Union and international law for decades.”
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a request violates this principle," the court said in a statement.
The lawyers also argued in a brief statement that banning immigrants from entering the United States would harm the U.S. economy, saying they were likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Application for asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality, or a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 statement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems — even all the serious ones — that people face every day.
Amusing rescue operations in Palus, where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly threatening.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforted her feverish little boy at the city evacuation centre in Palu.
“Every minute, new people arrive by ambulance.
There is not enough clean water.”
The residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting out the things that had gone through and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including those with a broken back and upper arm, were resting outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients continued to be treated in the field due to strong post-mortem strains.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled how a violent earthquake shook her fifth-floor hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
“It took time to save myself.
I think I was pushed against the wall in the ruins,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they are not in danger.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Bullying with Bullying’
A week after China’s official newspaper published a four-page advertisement under U.S. daily news about the mutual daily benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to an add-on paid by the China Daily last Wednesday in the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa - after China was accused of interfering in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new phase in Washington’s expanding campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where each other’s import tariffs are adjusted.
China’s countermeasures at the start of the tariff war were designed to capture exporters from states like Iowa because they supported Trump’s Republican Party, experts from China and the US have explained.
U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, as well as China’s largest exporter of agricultural products Terry Branstad, said Beijing was damaging American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a Sunday Des Moines Register opinion article: “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing promotional advertising in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America’s expensive freedom of expression and free press practice by placing its paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, there are only limited voices in Beijing’s street kiosk and cannot really see the differing views that the Chinese people might have on China’s worrying economic direction, given that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of China’s most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say what newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating female voters before mid-term elections with Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans are awaiting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of several sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will see a setback, especially from women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding the situation have been on the ceiling, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go ahead with voting.
These things cannot be taken back,” said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute effort to investigate the FBI would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre Washington, D.C., senior advisor to the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated “November is coming!” at a demonstration in the Senate corridor as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic said.
“Democratic indulgence and internal persuasion are starting to fall out of schedule,” Stu Rothenberg, an unofficial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who dislike the president and often abstain from voting."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault on the Supreme Court candidate, analysts predicted a setback as Republicans proceeded with confirmation.
"This has become very confusing for the GOP," former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the Commission’s vote, the final vote, whether Kavanaugh will be put in office, it’s also about how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they’ve treated him,” said Guy Cecil, head of the Priorities U.S., a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be a little divided, who, after the testimonies, believe in Ford and who in Kavanaugh, but a little more in support of the former.
A new poll by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they think Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied at the time of his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accusation against Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford pleaded before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet that will confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend Inrupt is the company that builds the Berners-Lee Open Source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In an extraordinary interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was “governing the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal online data collection” or POD.
This may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and competent tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available in one browser and at the same time.
What makes this personal online data collection unique is that the user can choose who will be able to access this information.
The company calls this “to grant personal authority through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt’s idea is for the company to bring resources, process, and relevant skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired under contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to bring about a complete change if all of their business models are fully supported overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post published in the Media on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based web.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the memorial stone of the Victorian Cross in World War I was opened
The Church of England, the only Church to receive the Victorian Cross during World War I, celebrated its 100th anniversary in its hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann fought for his decoration on 29 September 1918 in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attacks.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper bullet and did not know that he had received the highest British military decoration.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be "geniously symbolic" if the stone were opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning fight.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, "through a very thick hail of guns and machine guns."
Later, he hurried to the attack line and carried it forward with the "greatest galantness" before hurried to one machine gun alone and knocked out three opponents.
Lt. Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, when the war ended in just over a month.
Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I will never be able to repeat, but for which I will always be grateful.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Bath, placed a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood's royal youth band.
Michael Vann said he was “very honored to be part of this parade” and added that “the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero is appreciated.”
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa the Pig
Imagine you've been up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but you're not going to be shown this main event.
The San Jose match consisted of 13 fights, including six from the main card, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the UK all night long.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousas and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers were left with a mouthful after Peppa the Pig appeared on the screen.
Many were not enthralled, especially those who had stayed awake until the early hours to see this very struggle.
One fan on Twitter described the transition to children’s comics as “some kind of hurtful joke.”
“It’s government regulation that at 6:00 p.m., the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to the children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said in a statement.
"Pig Peppa, yes."
Bellator’s president Scott Coker said they plan to work on a schedule to take more account of the UK’s viewers in the future.
"When I think about the replay now, I think we can solve this problem in the future," Coker said.
“But if it’s 6:00 a.m. on Sunday morning there, we can’t do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn’t, it was a government rule.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We’re showing a five instead of six fights — as we usually do — we tried to offer fans more, and we just went over time.
This is a pitiful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality — but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went out of high school that “not everyone is like him”.
While attending Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 broadcast Desert Island Discs, she said she was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
Becoming a parent also changed her attitude toward winning the Olympic Games, giving her the feeling that it was no longer that important.
Kirsty Young, the usual long-term presenter, had to take a few months off due to her illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley said that growing up felt less valuable than the others because it was not socially acceptable if you liked boys and girls.
He said, “Until today, these feelings of not being worthy and feeling different have given me the power and the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth “something” and didn’t disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic champion has become the leader of the highly respected LGBT campaign, using his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he’s talking about it because he’s lucky enough to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man — U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “took him by surprise.”
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but she said the age difference had never been a problem.
“If you’re going through so much when you’re young,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it was hard to find someone as old as him who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “whole outlook” has changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But, you know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father refused to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 — because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you can’t sit in the front row because by then you’ll be gone,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died, I finally admitted that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew it was what I had dreamed of my whole life — diving in front of the crowd at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling about it,” he said.
It also inspired her first choice of songs — Heather Small’s Proud — which helped her prepare for the Olympics and still gives her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was removed from the game at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson makes a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to improve his form to avoid an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time every two years, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's doubles and four-ball.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has often been for the U.S., the five-time winner split his day in two, being a cheerleader and working on his game in the hope of improving it.
Never the most direct striker, not even at the height of his career, a 48-year-old is particularly unfit to play on the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where the long, tough trail punishes the constantly lost shots.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinar on Sunday, in his ninth race, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win his all four races this week.
If Americans who are four points behind at the start of 12 singles games start off fieryly, the Mickelson race can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband, but he had little more to add.
"He fully understood his part today, patted me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He is a celebrity and he has given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I expected more, but that was the way we had to go.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
Mickelson surpasses Nick Faldo’s record on Sunday as the player with the highest participation in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never met his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence has given the team an additional mental contribution.
"He's funny, he's mocking, he's funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he's just great in the team room," he said.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week and it was nice to see that.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows a big lead could soon be lost
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his own experience that the great leadership of the Ryder Cup last day at the start of singles can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dane made his public appearance at the 1997 race in Valderrama, where, together with Captain Seve Ballesteros, he held a five-point lead over the Americans, but over the finish line it was drastically reduced, winning only 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You even remember that we had a great leadership position in Valderrama; we also had a great success in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama where we won, that victory came very close,” said Bjorn in the picture after a Class of 2018 victory of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday’s success at 10:6 in Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you've got the points.
We have a goal, which is to win the cup, so let's focus on that.
"I've always said I'm focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who our opponents are - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to rush things forward.
Tomorrow there will be new obstacles.
Tomorrow, personal performances count, so it's something else.
It’s nice to be with an opponent when things are going well, but if you’re there in person, you’ll be fully tested as a golfer.
This is the message you have to give to the players - do your best tomorrow.
Now that you leave your partner, he has to go and do it himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will perform better in person than with his opponents, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both over the past few days, being part of Brookline's winning team, before becoming a part of losing, when Europe defeated "The Miracle of Medinah."
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put everything in their game on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start hot, like in Brookline and like in Medina.
When the momentum goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the average races.
We’ll set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the field in a way that we feel like a miracle can happen tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the race, and he is in the best of matches with Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other best Europeans in the race.
“I put my boys in that order because I think that’s how we’re covered,” Bjorn said in a statement.
Germany's new warship has been delayed again.
The newest speed yacht of the German Navy should have come into service in 2014, replacing outdated Cold War warships, but this won’t happen until next year due to faulty systems and increased costs in the form of snowballs, local media reported.
The launch of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class speedboat “Rheinland-Pfalz” has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military press release published in the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy already in 2014, but worrying problems after the transfer did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by outdated Bremen-class speed yachts.
It is understood that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealment technologies such as radar, infrared and audible signal reduction.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest speedboats should be able to be sent out of the home port for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that state-of-the-art warships - which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad - will become obsolete by the time they enter service.
The failed F125 speedboat appeared in the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent the ship back to the shipbuilder after receiving it.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware deficiencies" that rendered the warship unusable if used in a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are managed by a team of about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce of the older Bremen class speed yachts.
It was also found that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to incorporate future innovations.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is probably twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including team training, also becomes a problem.
It has been said to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) - compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the newer speedboats are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy's capacity is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the navy had in fact “exhausted ships that could be taken out”.
The official said the issue has grown over time as a snowball, as old ships were eliminated, but replacement ships did not come.
He regretted that none of the speedboats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust investigates the secret life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to look for their food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation measures.
A study by scientists from the Scottish National Trust tracks conventional and soprano pipes in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats.
Special recorders are placed in the main locations of the area to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also conduct field research using handheld sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings shall determine the frequency of the bat cries and the activity of the species.
A habitat map and report are then created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will show which habitats are most important to bats and how different species use them.
This information will help to determine the usefulness of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the UK as a whole, the bat population has declined significantly in the last century.
They are at risk from construction and development, which affects their habitats and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flying papers and the chemical treatment of some building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful in catching prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echo location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even created Scotland’s first and only special bat pool in the Threave area of Dumfrie and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says this area is the ideal territory for them.
“In Threave, we have a large area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great place to live.
But there’s still a lot to discover about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us better understand what they need.”
He stresses the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance on the property, as the unwanted destruction of one pregnancy and childbirth site can kill up to 400 mothers and adolescents, and even destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, disturbing or destroying them is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Flesh Mice Conservation Union, has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said, “We still have so much to learn about our bats and we just don’t know how many of our species and how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations while lawyers plan to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to advertise themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
She has allegedly paid a woman <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>330,643.10 not to talk about the incident, Der Spiegel said Friday.
Turning to Instagram live video of his 142 million followers half an hour after the allegations, Ronaldo (33) said it was “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What we're talking about today is fake news," Ballon d'Or's five-time winner told the news.
They want to advertise themselves with my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a lucky man and I’m fine,” added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for “inadmissible allegations of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player is seeking “compensation for moral harm corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player’s hotel room where he was allegedly raped, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was a “99 percent good man” of whom “one percent fails.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple’s sexual relationship, but it wasn’t unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because she feared “retribution” and was concerned about “public humiliation.”
Now, a 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to refute the solution, as the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Italy in connection with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal with the giant Juve.
Brexit: UK may regret the departure of car manufacturers forever
The UK “would regret it forever” if it lost its position as the world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily suspend their production at a factory near Derby in Burnaston.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the border stoppages without a Brexit deal could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures vehicles in Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see the production process in our factory stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without an agreement, worrying about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit deal.
The Toyota production line operates as needed, with spare parts arriving from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would not be able to hold more than one day’s supply at its Derbyshire plant, and production should therefore be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May Chequers’ plan for future EU relations was “precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls.”
"We need an agreement, we want the best solution that allows us to do what we want, and not just take advantage of the current success, but take full advantage of the opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
“Evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain setup.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run warned that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a trade union representative from Unite, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from our own experience that if jobs disappear, they will not come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s high-stakes meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed for another week as the fight against top-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible impediments to justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire a deputy Attorney General and thereby threaten Mueller’s independence has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing with Trump the use of interception devices to record conversations and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm that.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, announcing he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, who was then in New York at the United Nations.
Trump said he didn’t want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coincidence with the Senate Judiciary hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave credentials.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be postponed by another week, considering all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let’s take a look at this and keep the press informed, as always.”
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of information sessions was not the result of deliberately admitting disappointment to TV journalists, although he added: “I will not dispute the fact that they have been disappointed.”
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president does more questions and answers than any president before him," he said without adding any evidence: "We've been looking at these numbers."
“If the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it a lot and you’ve seen how we’ve done it over the past few weeks, so it’s going to be during the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated perhaps why, having been on the loose and sometimes odd-looking sidewalk before meeting the journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU employees in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU employees working for the NHS in Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to be present after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent her letter in less than six months before the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs associated with the established status of EU citizens working in its public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, heading towards the expected decisions of this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also made preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That’s why I wanted to repeat now how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the way healthcare works and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head trauma
Tennessee State Tigers backer Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury and defeat on Saturday 31:27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the halftime.
“He fell to his side and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on his side before he was placed on a stretcher and taken away from the field for further inspection.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV – Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center had ended.
Harris added that there are no details about the type/extent of the injury, and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Second year student Abercrombie was in her first season in Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, which resulted in a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreigners must pay a higher stamp tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy real estate in the UK, using this extra money to help homeless people under the new Tory plans
This Step Will Harm Corbyn's Attempt to Attract Young Voters
Stamp tax is levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects it to create up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp tax rate when they buy real estate in the UK, using this extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The movement is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with promises of affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The stamp duty is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, channelling additional money into the government’s desire to fight homelessness.
The surcharge — which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels imposed two years ago for second home and re-rental-related purchases — may be up to three percent.
The Treasury Department expects this movement to generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the properties purchased in London are owned by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet off when buying a home.
Many of the country's prosperous regions - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" thanks to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple tax to help young people buy their first home.
He blamed major construction companies for keeping property prices high when they buy land but don’t use it, and called on May to give up quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain’s “housing-related shame.”
Corbyn has announced an eye-catching housing reform, including a rent check and an end to bullying innocent people.
It also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year, as Prime Minister, I promised to dedicate myself to restoring the British dream that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
The UK is always open to people who want to live, work and build their own lives here.
At the same time, it is not right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, are as easy to buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland'
Sunderlan leader Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s leader at some point.
The Scot (42) is delighted with the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in the League One with only 3 points behind.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I reached B-grade and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“But I grew up with my dad in Hampden, Scotland, and it’s always something that’s pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come when I’m successful in running the club.”
Ross's predecessors to Sunderland have been Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid of such big and well-known names, having previously endured in both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me right now, it's a success if I can take this club to the Champions League."
Due to its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly a member of the Champions League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get there, but I only see myself as a success if I manage to get the club back there.”
Ross has worked as a manager for just three years, having previously served as deputy director of Dumbarton and 15 months among the Hearts’ executive staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling to the third level and made St Mirren's lowest position the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he was during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real crossroads,” he recalled the takeover of Alloa.
“I really thought driving was better for me than playing.
It seems odd because I managed, got a reasonable income, and enjoyed some of the highlights.
Playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I still experience it with the stress and pressure of my work, but the management just seems more right.
I've always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it. I feel more comfortable now than I've ever felt in adulthood."

According to research, the best time for a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has boosted British troubled pub turnover, but more pressure has been exerted on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while that of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, spokesman for business consulting firm CGA, said: “Continuous sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Championships meant that July was similar to June when pub sales grew by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants went even harder.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant trade in June deteriorated further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars traded the most successfully and the restaurants that tried the least to please the most.
The food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, though not as dramatically as the restaurateurs.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, a recreation and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year is particularly painful in addition to the ongoing price pressure.
A long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food businesses, and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide some imperative relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand-related agencies.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is a well-established industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 gymnasts found the growth of "fake Insta" leaves
News raises fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main account” to show their parents
The study found that one in five children, some just 11 years old, create secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 gymnasts found a noticeable increase in “fake Insta” accounts (a reference to the photo-sharing page Instagram).
The news has heightened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “main account” to show their parents, as well as a “main account” that was made acceptable to them.
One of the discoverers of her 13-year-old daughter’s secret page saw a teenager call to rape others.
The Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles and half of them admitted to having personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing to see so many teenagers tempted to create accounts on the Internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle Becomes Spokesperson for Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of Scottish Athletics at the annual board meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described it as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is respected everywhere in Scotland, the UK and other sports communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit from being called to leadership,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be a spokesperson for athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution to Scotland’s sport and contribute to its development.”
An American who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and now frequently shares his opinion with the BBC, was unable to walk after a transitory ischaemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that if I recover and if so, to what extent, only time will tell.
I’ve done a lot of work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and I’m already doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Breast pump advertising that compares women to cows divides the internet into two
The breast pump company has shared two camps on the Internet with an advertisement comparing a nursing mother to milking cows.
To mark the premiere of “the world’s first silent wearable breast pump,” the consumer-focused technology company Elvie published a similar advertisement for an ironic music video to showcase the freedom this new pump gives to mothers who want to live.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows and sing, “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see my tail” and “If you didn’t notice, these aren’t udders, they’re my breasts.”
The verse repeats: “Pump, pump, feeding the children, pump, pump, filling my ladies with milk.”
However, advertising on the company’s Facebook page has sparked controversial opinions on the internet.
With 77,000 views and thousands of comments, viewers of the video disagree. Many of them say that it illuminates the back of the dairy tent.
“Using cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but the difference is that they are stolen from them within days of birth.”
Elvie Breast Pump Doesn't Hit the Eye of a Breastfeeding Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “It is understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to promote breast pumps for mothers who are having babies?"
He added: “It’s totally unrecognizable advertising.”
There was a woman who thought it was a lot of fun.
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but let's take it the way it is.
“It’s a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertisement (often in their workplaces or toilets) for mothers who pump and feel like cows.
This advertising does not praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all danced in bras with non-visible pumps.
The idea of the campaign is based on the saying that many women pumping milk from their breasts feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or pipes, and does not stand out from a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep babies and even walk outdoors while pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and irritating introduction.
By comparing women’s expressions and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while also presenting in an entertaining and familiar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that the new pump creates.
This isn't the first time the news has covered Elvie's pump.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two, wearing a product by designer Marta Jakubowski, appeared on the stage.
Thousands of migrant children go quietly to camp on Texas border
The number of children of detained migrants has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies enforced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to set up children with the help of sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are documented immigrants and they have been afraid to violate the possibility of staying in their country, requiring custody of the child.
The threat increased in June when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other household adults could submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, told Congress last week that the agency had arrested a dozen people seeking financial support for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of sponsors or members of sponsors’ households are in the country illegally, and a large number of them have a criminal background.
So we will continue to pursue them," Mr Albence said.
To deal with children more quickly, officials enacted new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month after their arrest. Previously, asylum workers said it was 60 days after.
Many people defend their legal content in front of an immigration judge by video conferencing instead of being present.
Those unsuitable for release are expelled from the country quickly.
According to asylum workers, and according to system reports released in recent months - the longer a child is in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent demonstrations or attempted escape.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more topical in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where a child’s difficulty may be overlooked because of its size.
They added that moving children to a tent-city without giving them enough time to get used to the feeling or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, with which many are already struggling.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to come home to the UN General Assembly, despite the country’s eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegally under the pretext of counterterrorism and would be dealt with accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and unconditionally," he said in the Assembly.
Since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this holy war until we have cleared the entire Syrian territory” from both terrorist groups and “any foreign force that is illegally present.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking on the issue of war refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were appropriate and blamed some Western countries for spreading unreasonable fears that prevented the arrival of refugees.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them face up," he said.
“They’re politicizing something that’s just a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to Syria until there is an end to the war between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates the Idlib buffer zone at the last rebel base, has created an opportunity for further political talks.
The Russo-Turkish agreement prevented a widespread raid by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the three-million-capita province.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "explicit deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would hit jihadist fighters, including those from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convince a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump should be elected for a second term
According to this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020 if the dismissal and scandal had not previously ended his presidency, as liberal viewers probably want.
Which would undoubtedly be “the most exciting end of the presidency!”
At the moment, viewers do not show any signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak hour. Compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, their number has risen. The 3.5 million viewers on MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" via cable have kept its rating high during the main evening news.
“It’s a tension that we’re involved in because we don’t understand it,” the head of the ABC drama “Designated Survivor” said of a government secretary who will become president if an attack destroys a parliament building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
He remembers the pre-election taxi ride in Boston in 2016.
The manager told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
“He said he would make me laugh,” Mrs. Scovell told me.
All this chaos has an entertaining value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, Washington’s rumors could become fatal to Roe v. Wade’s future and to the immigrant families and the global economy that want to reunite.

When he met Fleiss this week, his home on Kauai’s northern shore was 80 degrees warm, but he had sneaked into the room to watch MSNBC while recording on CNN.
He couldn’t stop watching Brett Kavanaugh deal with the Senate Legal Committee and see the fate of the Supreme Court hanging on his head.
“I remember doing all sorts of crazy shows in our time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Elsewhere, cash flows are moving into the busiest White House mid-term election
It is not surprising that District 17 of Pennsylvania receives cash flow as a result of the reorganization of the congressional district, bringing two dominant companies to the same location.
As a result, Conor Lamb of the Democratic Republic of Pittsburgh district was re-elected, winning a seat in the second district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
The lamp's counter-candidate is Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the previous 12th District of Pennsylvania, which in the larger section overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's ruling in January, as a result of which the old districts were divided into unconstitutional electoral districts, favouring the Republicans.
The new 17th election has triggered a campaign in which the financial departments of the major political parties - the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC) - are trumping themselves with money.
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a sluggish victory in the March 18th congressional election.
This has happened to a Republican for several decades, and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Politicians have given the Democrats a small advantage.
El Salvador Sentenced for Supporting China, then Withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, which was a small setback for Washington.
Mr. Trump met in a friendly atmosphere with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a Panama hotel until his partners threw out the administration team of Trump’s company.
Foreign ministry officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries have recently stopped supporting Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador, which received <0x24>140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, was planned to be punished, including for drug monitoring, development and economic stimulus.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to organise a follow-up to a similar meeting last year that was seen as a development in efforts to prevent migrants moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials explained that they wanted to continue the talks and end discussions on any El Salvador sanctions.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is now being criticized, who will speak at a meeting in mid-October to discuss the government’s positions.
And three American ambassadors secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without Washington's new harsh announcements or penalties.
A White House spokesman, Mr Bolton, declined to comment on the details of what three American officials had said, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national debates on a request to remain anonymous.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke at the request of anonymity.
Educational History
Next, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller will publish a report on Trump’s possible justice, which has a lot of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia’s attack on our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would have to report back to this institution as if he were going to speak again to voters and perhaps even to his peers.
There are many butts here and I do not want to point out that the impeachment of Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler if only the West had stopped him and supported Czechoslovakia in Münich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of massacres.
History is going around such turning points, and the ruthless march of democracy is getting closer or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water since it was announced that last year he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated about his ineligibility for the post.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is inaccurate.
“How do you react if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimonies?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the mid-term elections if Trump is held accountable?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter vacation.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our ambassadorial home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me the light of a Sabbath candle on a table with a hooker.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic in the run-up to the Battle of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that their victory over Australia, which followed an impressive draw earlier this month against Villarreal in Spain, will put them in a strong position to win the European League G Group.
Knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to make the first appearance of the season before the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent," said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game believing we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but in general it was a fair outcome.
They were better in the first half of the game and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but because the people support us, I am sure we will be able to pull ourselves together and get a good result.
“Last year was hard, because I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can move on now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can’t sleep due to fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the interviewees had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed this with their family members.
About half of the nationwide study participants said they would talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want their family members to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of nationwide life insurance.
However, this should begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for caring if they don’t know your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely important in terms of costs.
Consult with your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan on how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with financial value to help cover these costs, or proprietary self-insurance – as long as you have the money you need.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles from the start.
Get yourself a health care credential to identify a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that specialists follow your request at a time when you yourself are unable to communicate.
Also consider a trustee regarding your finances.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write these things down so you can be ready if needed.
“It’s not just about the financial side, it’s also about who the doctors would be,” explained Martin.
“What medications are needed?
Who takes care of the dog?
Put it all in order.”
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with air rifle
The man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home after a night out.
In his 40s, the victim was shot in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, Devon, in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Police described the shooting at about 2:30 a.m. as an accidental act.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are asking all witnesses to contact him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the number of deaths continues to increase.
Because of the disconnection, the rescuers have not received any information from the Regents of Donggala north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located on the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was unexpectedly hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala Regents is an area stretching over 300 km (180 miles) in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
Regents, which is an administrative region under the province, had an estimated 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the Donggala Coastal Region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, which is mainly concentrated on the opposite coast of Morowal, Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, over the past 100 years, tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Circle of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, the west coast of Sumatra was hit by several severe earthquakes.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit south of Indonesia’s most populated Java island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit an area near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the Sumatra Islands - the Isle of Mentawai, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake hit Pidie Jaya Regents in Aceh, sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami disaster of 2004.
The tsunami did not occur at the time, but more than 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, for allegations of domestic violence, interfering in a domestic violence report, and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to report the alleged crimes to the police, Palin took her phone.
Palin is being held in a Mat-Su investigative facility and is being held against a <0x24>500 unsecured bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring he was "in no way guilty," the news network said.
Palin faces three A-grade misdemeanours, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a class B misdemeanor, punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal case has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, his mother, Sarah Palin, was summoned by police.
The case is currently being heard in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in a domestic violence crime report, and possession of a weapon, all in a state of drunkenness.
His wife said he hit him in the face.
Groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior with PTSD, a result of her service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not functioning and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the outskirts of downtown Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu.
U.S. Attorneys Request Rare Death Penalty for Terrorist Suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of being involved in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people. This rare punishment has not been executed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing both pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
According to a death penalty application filed in the southern New York area, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and caused serious bodily harm.
In both cases, the court documents indicate that there is a potential death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jurors' assembly filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, which included eight murder charges, along with blackmail charges commonly used by federal prosecutors for organized criminal offences, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “intensity of planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s actions as “terrible, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnicco's family and friends.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since New York's Southern District Court's last death trial.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed was in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in New York City in 1953, when the couple were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, the ancient Uzbek, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he was pleased with what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos viewed on his phone.
Police said he also wanted to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
In a 22-point indictment, he has not accepted the blame.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s national defense lawyers, said they were “clearly disappointed” with the procedural decision.
"We believe that the death penalty decision will prolong the trauma of all concerned, rather than accepting a life sentence without a chance of release," Patton said.
Earlier, Saipov’s defence team asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Tory MEP said NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” during today’s Tory protest.
A former UKIP leader said politicians had to “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics because one of her own MPs suggested that she lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative House member Peter Bone said at a march in Birmingham that the UK “would be out by now” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May faces the problem of reconciling her deeply divided lines, underlined by pro-remaining conservatives, joining the city in her anti-Brexit protest.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track among Brexit supporters, icebreakers and EU attacks.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels despite the retaliation and force Eurosceptics and liberals to choose between their package and “chaos.”
Bone said at a "Leave Means Leave" meeting in Solihull that she wanted to "give up Chequers' plan".
He recommended taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“We’d be out by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MEP added: “I stand out for Brexit, but we must abandon Chequers’ plan.”
Reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The belief that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.”
Tory’s Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and with our activists who actually walk the streets and elect us at all.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: “Prime ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said the politicians who were in the meeting had to be made to “feel hot” if they were planning to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let that happen.’”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, uncomfortable.
“We will mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us victory over Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
At the same time, the icers marched through Birmingham before the two-hour gathering in the center of the city.
A handful of activists waved the slogans “Tories against Brexit” after the group was set up this weekend.
The Liberal Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues that their party’s application received at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can put IT systems in place and bring all the technology to Canada and more, for a smooth border crossing, for cross-border, unrestricted trade to Ireland,” he added.
“This is a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president after November’s election
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future in the West Massachusetts Town Hall on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will stand in the next election in November against GOP National Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the vice president of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that he may be the opponent of Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the Town Hall after Trump took office.
The attendee asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, that is, the first lady.”
LSU Sims Shooting Arrested
LA Police in Baton Rouge on Saturday reported that a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday had been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at about 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
They released a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help in identifying the man they saw.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene, having a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge police station.
The two-meter-long Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of which were in the starting line-up, an average of 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Championship after team record gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday in front of Lewis Hamilton that the ranking of the Mercedes team plays a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start and almost neglected Hamilton when he defended his position the first two times and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit stops first and left Hamilton’s group behind in the busy traffic that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit stop later in the ring and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went to the lead after the stand side by side when the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside to pass free after a third corner attempt to defend it with a double move.
Max Verstappen started the race from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place for his 21st birthday at the end of the first round.
He then led the race most of the time, driving towards the finish in rubber whistles and passing Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He eventually reached the pit stop in the 44th lap, but failed to increase his speed in the last eight laps, which gave Räikkönen fourth place.
Today is a hard day because Valtteri did a good job all week and was a real gentleman who let me by.
"The team has done a great job of having one of two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday’s rally over the incident that she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not address Ford's testimony directly before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on what is happening in the Senate at the moment, demonstrating that people are "evil, disgusting, and lying."
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and is happening right now that has happened in the Senate in a few days is that you see angry and angry, mean, nasty and lying people,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks that say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question, “Did you leak the document?”
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Whether we leaked ... no, we didn’t leak,” he added with the senator’s face.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein about the charges against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his job.
The Hill said: “I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did so as she asked.”
But his denial didn’t suit the president, who commented at Saturday’s meeting: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but it’s one of the worst body languages I’ve ever seen.”
While continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president hinted that the Democrats were using these accusations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power without choosing the means.
You see this meanness and disgust. They don’t care who they hurt, who they need to overrun in order to gain power and leadership,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 : 3 Belfast Giants
Giants Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee
The Dundee Stars defeated the Belfast Giants at a rematch in the elite league on Saturday, losing 5-3 to Dundee.
The Giants led the game early with two goals for Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillieri.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to the draw before Dwyer led the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized Dundee's position before the gates of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was the third loss for Adam Keefe's men in the elite league, and they came to Belfast on Friday night to beat Dundee at 2:1.
It was the fourth match of the season, with the Giants winning three previous games.
Dwyer's goal came in at 3:35 p.m. with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 in the fast first trimester, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie score a draw goal in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants would lead before the first pause, hitting the second goal at the end of the first third of their evening.
On the home pitch, the players were re-concentrated and Bouchard re-leveled them, scoring a 27:37 goal in a numerically dominant minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a lead position for the first time at the end of the second third of the game, securing victory in the last third of his team's offensive zone.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will meet Milton Keynes in the next game.
Air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of people from earthquake
One Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
The massive earthquake that hit Sulawesi on Friday caused a tsunami that killed more than 800 people, many of whom remain unknown.
The region is plagued by strong aftershocks and many people are trapped under the ruins of the town of Palu.
Despite the fact that colleagues of 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung escaped from the swinging tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, he refused to leave.
He remained on duty to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the same time on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the tower, thinking it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We've set up a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter arrived in Palus.
"We were very sad to hear about this," the spokesman added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could increase to thousands. According to the National Agency for Disaster Relief, access to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong was restricted.
The agency’s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said: “The number of deaths could increase because many of the victims’ bodies are still in ruins and have not been accessed.”
The 6-metre waves ravaged the town of Palu, where mass burials are taking place on Sunday.
The military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance is making new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we can’t say what they can find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palus on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work night and day to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
The Indonesian city of Lombok was hit by an earthquake earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugin says man missing after plane crash in lagoon
While previously it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane, the airline now claims that one man has been missing, as it was flying a plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon they could not find a single male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger’s details, such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six of the passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon far from the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low when it landed.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to wade to the emergency exit in the water at the height of the waist.
He mentioned that the cabin crew was panicking and screaming and that he had a minor head trauma.
The United States Navy and the sailors who worked on the nearby quay also helped in the rescue by using inflatable boats to take people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres.
Air safety network data show that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline-related accidents in the last two decades, but none of them were linked to Air Niugin.
Analyst draws up a schedule for the night the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office closed a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett spent several hours as an expert observer analyzing intelligence.
He revealed to jury members how he used cell phone records to recreate the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett said he received location information from several cell phones that showed that Telli was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to the young man’s earlier claims.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, which is why the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford’s car, Sanford said he “lied because my car was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before her death.
The phone records showed that the girls had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett claimed that shortly after Chambers’ death, Tellis erased Chambers’ messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defendant is scheduled to make his speech on Sunday.
The judge said he thinks the case will go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to combat negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from the basics of solving its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Bands like The Fugees and Common have recently regained popularity in the UK thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
Yet another black man?
New York babysitter sues for racist message in couple's court
A New York City nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an accidental message from a mother complaining that the nanny was “another black woman.”
The couple denies that they are racists compared to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her outrage when she learned that their new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband saying, "EIIIIIIIIIIII, ORDERAL BLACKNESS."
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice after she understood her buzz, claiming that their social nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and had been waiting for a Filipino to replace her.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for the compensation he wants to receive for his dismissal for the next six months, in the amount of <0x24>350 a day, and the same job he was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
“I want to show them that you look, so let’s do it,” he told The Post, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have rejected the claim that they are racists, saying that ending employment with Maurice was a sensible act because they feared that after insulting her, they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t think of.
He's not a racist.
"We are not racists," Joel Plasco, her husband, told The Post.
“But would you let your children be kept by someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was unintentional?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Would you go against someone like that?
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
While the case is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, where they are severely criticized for their behavior and thinking.
The new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not relate to the talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, said in the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of the person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He said his father, inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was grieving over his father's death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member of our family,” he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was a fairly quiet man and not a boastful person,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like feeling your child accomplish something: you’re proud of them, even though it’s not exactly your accomplishment.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always acknowledged Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When he landed, his daughter was rushed to a hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save his life.
“They called regularly to say that the daughter was in a very bad condition and that they didn’t believe she would survive,” said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nadi, who said my daughter was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medications the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly disappearing and leaving his body.
He was dead a little while before that, and now all systems are shutting down.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn’t cry, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning for her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who knew nothing about her experiences.
"No one knew that," he said.
“I kept my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outburst of compassion for Nadi on that flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much she loved him.”
Postcards of grieving woman prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide nails work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pasted maps on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when she was suffering from depression, and 18 when she killed herself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that her smile would make the whole room shine.”
However, he stopped working before he died because he was in a “very bad place with himself.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried it's going to have a domino effect."
Ms. Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even with a friend.
“Don’t shut up, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything,” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point during the first Christmas holiday – when the children opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything.”
Ms. Humphreys said that the man’s death was a terrible trauma for them, but they have to deal with it: “It will tear the wound into the whole family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we have to go ahead and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs in the balance while FBI investigates
“I believed that if we actually got something he wanted — a limited time and scope of investigation — we might be able to achieve unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “collapse” in the midst of a permanent partisan stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance was due to timing.
If the Republicans are not doing as well as expected, they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want in front of the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast a decisive vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of runners 'declining' under Kim's rule
South Korea’s legislation has said that the number of North Korean runners to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Convergence, said that their number had declined last year compared to the number of military runners in 2011 (2706) (1127).
Mr. Park said the key factors were stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a greater number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North Korean runners have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul magazine, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China takes militants as illegal immigrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back to their home countries by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which is technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the dismantling of nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, where they pledged to work towards a broadly nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of failing to make progress on sanctions.
“Without trust in the United States, our country lacks security, and under such circumstances, we are in no way willing to disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was “unfit” to be a Supreme Court judge.
House opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was temperamentally unfit to work as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi spoke in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I inevitably noticed that if a woman had spoken in this way, she would have been called hysterical," Pelosi said of his reaction to the testimony given Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Kavanaugh.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening remarks, describing his family and high school years, he almost screamed from time to time and was speechless at times.
He also explicitly condemned members of the Democratic Party who were on the committee, calling the allegations against him for losing Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election a “gross and coordinated homicide” organised by angry liberals.
According to Pelosi, he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that the man was not fit to be a Supreme Court judge because it showed that he was inclined against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi remained unpretentious when asked if he would try to dismiss Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, should the Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I say so much – if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only fit to be a judge at the Supreme Court, he’s not fit to be a judge at the court where he currently works,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Columbia District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade (legitimate court precedent for abortion – translator's comment) because he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation session, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court rulings.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical biased person to become a judge and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that great?’”
Women have to wear it.
It is a fair choice of words, a month-and-year overflowing anger, and he cannot get away with it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, right?”
He continued: “I got help from a woman who was a manager somewhere; she said that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a method that consisted of saying when she got angry and started crying to the person she was talking to, “You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partly accepted as an expression of rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is of an early job in an office with a majority of men, where I once found myself crying in indescribable rage when an older woman — a strict leader I had always been a little afraid of — grabbed me by the collar and dragged me to the staircase.
“Never show them how to cry,” he told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and that’s satisfying.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Party congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage love affair on a Monkey Business yacht and ended the campaign, deeply annoyed Schroeder thought there was no reason why he should not think about running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me, laughing 30 years later.
“Seven candidates were already running, and the last thing they needed was someone else joining.”
Someone said it's like "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was coming to an end, he was late in raising funds, and he vowed not to run if he didn’t get <0x24>2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated <0x24>1,000 to the men, gave him only <0x24>250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave a speech announcing that he would not launch an official campaign, feelings of gratitude for the people who supported him, irritability against the system that made it difficult to raise money and turn to voters instead of delegates, and hatred for sexism were so overpowered that tears came to his throat.
"You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said in a statement.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they wrote on my gravestone.
"She was crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The openings of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the gap between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by imposing taxes on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs on <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, essentially imposing taxes on half the goods arriving from China to the US.
Beijing has responded the same way every time, last with tariffs ranging from five to ten percent on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has pledged to respond to the US one shot at a time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink soon.
Getting Washington to retreat would mean yielding to demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing gets its cards right, the trade war with the US could support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing may create the conditions that will lead to the loss of control over the economy in another country is actually much more dangerous than bystanders have previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on researching Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready to return refugees on a voluntary basis and asks for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country would improve.
“At the moment, the situation on the territory of the country is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All the conditions are now in place for refugees who have left the country for terrorism and for unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods to return voluntarily.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
At the same time, he stressed that the country does not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team at Le Golf National near Paris, France, with a final result of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe was crowned once again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points to win the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson hit 16 waters on par-3, handing over the win to Francesco Molinar.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players who have scored 5 : 0 : 0 in the current format starting in 1979.
For American Jordan Spieth, 5&4 was won by Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest-ranking Dane on the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, beat Englishman Ian Poulter with 2 and 1 to be the last to win the Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most-winning European of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold myself back.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so glad we got the cup back.
It’s about team spirit and I’m glad to be able to help,” said emotional Garcia after Europe’s victory.
He gives the torch to his compatriot Jon Rahm, who won the singles game against US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
“I’m extremely proud to have won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup score of 13:21:3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 Grand Prix titles, only to be left behind by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was busy finding fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finnau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s disappointing performance, “I’m proud of the guys, they were hearty.
There were moments in the morning when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought them.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players did a great job.
Let's get together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've got to get our hats up.
We played better.”
New information on water bloom: concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Commission on Fisheries and Wildlife (FWC) shows an overall decrease in the concentration of blooming algae in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there are reports of more patchy blooms in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier, suggesting declining concentrations.
The water blooms approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
The patches can be found 10 miles (16 km) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but there have been fewer spots compared to last week.
Water blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations on the coast or high seas were reported in Pinellas County, low to high concentrations on the high seas in Hillsborough County, Manatee County from background to high concentrations, Sarasota County from coast and high concentrations on the high seas, and low to high concentrations on the coast and low to low seas in Charlotte County from background to medium concentrations on the high seas.
The counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier continue to receive reports of respiratory irritation.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida during the past week.
