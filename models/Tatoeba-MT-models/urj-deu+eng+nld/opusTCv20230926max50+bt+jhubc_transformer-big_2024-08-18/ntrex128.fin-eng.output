Members of the Welsh Parliament are afraid to look like fools
Some members of the Council are puzzled by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The House of Representatives changed its name to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Parliament, regardless of the party’s position, are concerned that the change may cause them to be ridiculed.
According to a Labour spokesman, the group is concerned that the name "Lines with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid party, the majority of the group is "not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
A Conservative spokesman said his group is "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that there is a short word leap from the MWP to the word "stupid".
In Welsh, the letter w is pronounced in this context similarly to the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The committee of the Council of Representatives, which is currently drafting the necessary legislative amendment to the name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on the names of the members of the Council is the responsibility of the Members themselves."
The Law on the Welsh Government of 2017 authorises the Council to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, which showed broad support for the nomination of a representative body to the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission preferred the title of Members of the Welsh Parliament or the abbreviation WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion poll.
Members of the Council are apparently proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus could cause a headache for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to propose a legislative amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also includes other changes to the functioning of the representative body, such as the rules on loss of office and the form of the committee system.
When dealing with legislation, the members of the Council may give their final vote on the title under which they should be called.
Macedonians go to the polls in referendum on changing country’s name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of its northern neighbour is, in practice, a territorial requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its aspirations for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins bells go down as Harlem churches go through difficult times
“The elderly people I’ve been talking to say there used to be a bar or a church on every street corner,” says Adams.
"Today there is neither."
He said that losing bars is understandable.
He said, "People's interactions have changed."
“Bars are no longer common neighborhood living rooms where people regularly gather.”
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not carry as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to square one."
He added that churches can be replaced with dwellings and apartments that are not inhabited by people who would support the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"An undeniable number of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he says, "and thus they will hasten the day when these churches will close their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by Caucasian churches before Harlem became an area for blacks to live in - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church moved away in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired the building.
St Martins was taken over by the Black Congregation under Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street in central Harlem for their opposition to hiring or promoting black people.
When Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild the building, they introduced a tower clock game.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martins, proudly called the tower clock game “the clocks of the poor.”
The expert who played the tower bell game in July called it another name: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world’s first tower clock game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex swamp involving architects and contractors hired by lay leaders of the Church and the Episcopal Diocese.
Sakast - a governing body of lay leaders of the parish - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would "try to roll up the costs" on the Sakast, even though the Sakast had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency with regard to the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old lobster diver in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while diving lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place in Beacon's Beach, Encinitas, just before seven o'clock in the morning.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help. He and a group of others paddled to the boy's place to help him out of the water.
Hammel told me that he thought he was just excited to catch the lobster, but then realized he was screaming, “I was bitten!”
I was bitten!'
When Hammel gets to the boy, he says he noticed that his entire clavicle had been torn open.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be in critical condition.
The species of the attacking shark is not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim had sustained serious torso injuries.
Authorities have closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casabladi to Ecinitas in Swami for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department store-style beauty departments with expert advisors.
This is a major move for the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty industry, which continues to grow despite the decline in fashion and household goods sales. Larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, they will be expanded to other stores next year.
Beauty products are placed because supermarkets tend to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury’s says its beauty lineup will double to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific areas just like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique makeup range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan friendly, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will experiment with rental stores at two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift of grocery shopping to small, one-time purchases in local shops force supermarkets to invent new incentives for customers.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said stores will look even more like department stores as a supermarket chain struggles with low-cost stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores, as well as Habitat stores. According to the company, this has promoted food sales and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended in a dispute over how the profits of supermarket pharmacies should be distributed.
The new strategy follows the acquisition of 281 stores by Sainsbury's to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds is part of a plan to expand the range of luxury skin care products to four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are ready to advise customers.
Our range of brands meets all your needs and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us a convincing beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'rageous' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in anger when TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home accessories and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pissed off Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute. She now plans to focus on her new gigantic deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “angry” last Tuesday at a tense meeting at Jones’s business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star admitted that his new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their homeware and accessories brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million assets.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, “Truly was clearly Holly’s most important project.
It was his long-term plan to secure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone in amazement.
No one believed Tuesday's events so close to the release.
Marlow’s headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold.”
This Morning host is one of the UK’s most lucrative stars, and experts say his departure could cause the company millions of losses due to product investments ranging from pillows to candles and clothing to household items, not to mention delays in release.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for about 10 years.
Willoughby hosted Capp for Truly in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over as president in March.
The couples are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will serve as M&S’ brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said the night before, “We will not comment on his business.”
Tight talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for his comment, which some would consider inappropriate for the president, as well as his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be a news anchor.
"I did not give up."
He pointed out Kim’s interest in meeting again after Trump had glowed the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
The nuclear talks, however, have stepped up.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a “corresponding reaction” from the United States to the early disarmament efforts of North Korea.
He added that the United States would continue to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We are doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have such an excellent relationship.”
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: missile tests have been halted, hostages have been helped to freedom, and remnants of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get into this crowded hall outside with 10,000 more, we’d have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing directly at the audience in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island, killing hundreds
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, a number of foreign voluntary organisations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency for international aid was not declared, despite the fact that about 10% of the Lombok population had become homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so the situation is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is a group travelling to return, it is not certain that foreign staff can work on the field.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Sutopo, said the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation to see if international organisations would be allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia remains unfortunately unprepared to face the forces of nature, in view of the recurrent earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
There were likely deaths due to a missing tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was in place.
Travelling between the numerous Indonesian islands is challenging even in the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the Lombok earthquake is on its way back to Lombok, but it will take at least three days for it to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has made the development of Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure the focal point of his election campaign, and he has poured money into improving roads and railways.
However, Joko’s administration has been plagued by a funding gap, while new elections are approaching next year.
The pressure is also exacerbated by tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority in the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with jungle knives, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands forced to leave their homes.
See: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge sank a late handicap against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League after finishing 89 minutes on Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27th from Chelsea while his team was in a losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before scooping the shot towards the rear post.
The shot hovered high over the penalty area towards the upper right corner.
In the end, the ball dropped over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq are always playing as much upwards as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and I fired without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the game 1-0 in the half after Belgian painter Eden Hazard painted in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave Mateo Kovacic a head-to-head position before he ran away near the midfield and spurred to Liverpool's half of the field.
Kovacic played in the middle of a fast wall pitch.
Then he released Hazard to the penalty area with a great pass.
Hazard escaped from the defense and passed Liverpool with a shot from Alisson Becker's left foot in the back corner.
Liverpool will meet in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia's disaster agency said early Sunday that the number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo, said at a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck Friday and raised waves up to six metres high.
The fragments of the collapsed buildings spread widely to the town of Kirk, which had a population of 380,000.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder after finding woman stabbed to death
A woman's body found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, opened a murder investigation this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police will ask the people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to anyone in Birkenhead near John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on a dashboard video, to contact the police, who may have vital information for the investigation."
A female police spokeswoman has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who may have known her have come to the crime scene and asked where she was found.
As the investigation continues, police say they are trying to inform the victim’s family.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police had said no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it may be hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling the man that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene.
He repeated, “It’s terrible.”
At two o’clock in the afternoon, there were two mayas in the isolated area, and outside there was a third.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who supervised the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something will be asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 using ID 247 on September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue is part of history's rewrite sketch
The eviction of the statue would be a poetic right, considering that his own fanatical Puritan supporters destroyed England's cultural and religious memorabilia like the best of the Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "rewriting history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate about the removal of the statues would make a target of Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell might suffer from the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent description of Cromwell embodies the opinions of the 19th century and is a historical proof of a character that many still regard as worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more in the nineteenth century than they are today, regard Cromwell as a defender of parliament against external pressure, which in this case, of course, was caused by the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain, at least, is that the dispute of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell, in turn, is a recognizable figure that represents the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a state administrator deserve praise and remembrance."
Killer Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
Local media reports that a pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified by his last name "Yuan" was found near a pig in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province. The man's artery had been severed and he was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The herdsman is preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have travelled with his cousin from nearby Yunna province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found a nearby pig's door open.
In the pig, he said he saw a large herd with a mouth full of blood.
According to the news, a forensic investigation confirmed the death of a farmer of a 250-pound beetle.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named "Wu" said that "my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised."
The surveillance camera shows my cousin coming to the market to feed the pigs at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday morning.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not harm others while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs are known to have attacked humans in the past, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 300 kilograms wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife managed to chase the animal away.
After the incident, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that although pigs aren’t usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They are just playful.
They are like little children, very curious, and they are not meant to hurt.
You just have to respect them properly,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa’s remains bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to deteriorate as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 meters per second, a first-class hurricane, on Sunday at five o’clock east coast time, and it was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, heading east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives on the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she begins to push deep tropical moisture northwards toward the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Thereafter, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching low pressure will form large rainfall areas in the southwest in the next few days.
Local rainfall rates of 25-100 millimeters cause dangerous heavy rainfall and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfall rates of between 50 and 75 millimetres per hour in certain deposition areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
In certain regions in the south-west, and particularly in Arizona, rainfall is expected to reach 50-100 millimeters.
Heavy rainfall is possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the dispersion of tropical rainfall.
In the event of a threat of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going to the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flooded rivers, and thunderstorms cause local winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure zone brings local heavy rainfall to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfall of more than 10 millimeters is possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Scattered tropical rain showers begin approaching Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday, until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last for the entire Wednesday.
In October, strong fluctuations in temperatures across the U.S. can be seen as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain rather warm.
This sometimes causes high temperature fluctuations over short distances.
The central United States sees an excellent example of large temperature differences on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and between Nebraska, St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees.
The lingering heat of the summer tends to intensify and expand again in the next few days.
From the beginning of October, it is expected to be widely warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with temperatures around +26 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, temperatures can rise to +26 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees Celsius warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecast, the eastern United States has good prospects for above-average temperatures in the first half of October.
Over 20 Million Viewed Brett Kavanaugh Hearing
More than 20 million people watched a broadcast on six television channels on Tuesday, in which Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of a sexual offence in the 1980s, gave their intriguing testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as the broadcasters interrupted their broadcast at the last minute, with the FBI conducting a week-long investigation into the allegations on the basis of a contract arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure Kavanaugh was intoxicating him and tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave a sentimental testimony in which he said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than Nielsen announced on Friday.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other broadcasters such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often finds it difficult to measure the spectators who are watching in the offices.
Something about the proportions indicates that the number corresponds to the number of viewers of an American football playoff game or an Oscar gala.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers of all television broadcasters, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, the interest was still high.
At the heart of Friday's drama was Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras filmed how protesters’ screams escorted him to the elevator on the way to a hearing in the Justice Committee on Friday.
CNN showed live how he stood for minutes with his eyes down as the reproaches flew.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you believe he's telling the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," she was told.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and added before the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say after hearing the committee.
Hours later, cable and broadcasting networks were broadcast directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began voting to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the vote in the Senate plenary.
Flake, however, said he would only act on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake became convinced, in part, by his conversations with his friend, Democrat Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
Flake’s choice had power because it was clear that Republicans wouldn’t have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit policy
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her EU exit plans of threatening Britain’s future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will be attending a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack May's so-called Chequers plan, calling the proposal that Britain and the EU would recover each other's import duties "absolutely absurd".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson for Death of LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who played basketball at LSU.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, and according to the Baton Rouge Police Department, he is charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities have released a video of Sims and Simpson’s confrontation, in which police say Sims lost their glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA, WAFB said.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde during interrogation.
His bail was set at <0x24>350,000, according to Advocate magazine.
An East Baton Rouge coroner released a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the residents of the area for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports chief Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “extraordinariness and justice enforcement.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning he was "horrified" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this happening," Wayde said.
Volcano spits ashes over Mexico City
The ash erupting from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the Mexico Disaster Prevention Center urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as crater activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded during the 24 hours.
The center records rumblings and vibrations several times.
Social media posted images of car windshields in residential areas like Xochimilco in Mexico City covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity of the volcano 72 kilometers southwest of the capital since Mexico was shaken by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan Separatists Convene Before Independence Day
In Barcelona on Saturday, six people were arrested in a clash between pro-independence demonstrators and the riot police, with thousands taking part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of a dissenting resignation vote.
Police arrested a group of masked independence supporters who threw eggs and powder paint at the police, forming dark clouds of dust on the normally tourist-filled streets.
Over the course of the day, more clashes broke out as the police used their batons to curb the mobs.
The clashes between pro-independence and unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting “no forgetting, no forgiveness” and the latter shouting “Long live Spain”.
The local press reports that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations.
The tension in the pro-independence region is still on the rise one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declares illegal, but which is celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for independence by a clear majority, although participation was low when opponents boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in the violent clashes last year when police tried to block voting at polling stations across the region.
On Friday, pro-independence groups spent the night outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia’s independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.”
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he says.
Despite a narrow but vital victory in last December's regional elections, the momentum of the Catalan independence parties has faded this year, with many of the most famous leaders in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their involvement in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a pro-police demonstration on his phone, says politicians on both sides of the controversy are stirring up.
"The situation is getting worse all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders in custody since last nine years, announced that he would participate in next year’s European elections.
"Becoming a candidate for the European election is the best way to condemn the erosion of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car collision with house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The event took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blommings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point the car may have been shot with a crossbow.
Livingston wins Rangers 1-0 with Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal at Livingston secured victory
Livingston surprised the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was finally enough to win, with Gary Holt's team taking second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew missed their first away win of the season in the Premiership, and next Sunday they will meet the series leader Hearts, who is eight points ahead.
In the meantime, the Rangers will meet Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, went on to play six games in the series without losing. Head coach Holt has not lost a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost seats in response to a visitor suffering from a lack of blade
Holt’s team should have been leading long before they scored, after causing the Rangers severe difficulties with their directness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finishing was wide. Next Alan Lithgow was able to slid on the ground to Craig Halkett's dovetail, but directed the ball past.
The hosts gave control of the ball to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate for special situations.
An important goal came in this way.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Menga, where he was able to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but said the home team would hold the defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little chance to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight back.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's company, and Lithgow took over the ball in one more special situation at Livingston.
In addition, two situations demanded a penalty kick - Halkett's tackled replacement Glenn Middleton and a ball in the hand.
"Awesome performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent with every player, continuing the ascending season.
The team’s playing style and crew have not changed much since it returned to the highest league level. However, Holt has to be commended for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing at leading an excellently organized defense, with Menga keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked ideas.
At times the team has performed very well under Gerrard, but now it is far from his standard.
The last pass was exhausted, and they only managed to open the home team's defense once, which should serve as a wake-up call to the Rangers, the middle of the league table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky was blue on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations with NATO allies.
There have been disagreements on human rights and freedom of the press as well as on Turkey's EU aspirations.
Erdogan travelled to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police prevented a group of 25,000 supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, citing security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to watch the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Competing demonstrations reflect a divergence of opinions, and some German Turks greet him as a hero while others slander him as a despot.
Road accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at about ten o'clock local time in the southwestern part of Deptford, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there is heavy traffic.
The driver stopped and the medical staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
Police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his family.
There are roadblocks and buses have been diverted, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in unrest
Prison officials say six prison guards were injured in the men's high-security prison riots.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, and continues.
Tornado police have been brought in to calm the unrest, with eight prisoners behind them in one prison wing.
Minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been sent to the HMP Long Lartin prison to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars.”
There are more than 500 inmates in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
The warden was reportedly hospitalized in June after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In addition, in October, riot police were alerted to serious riots in which staff members were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of heavy rainfall to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drought areas can benefit)
Tropical low pressures rarely arrive in Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s happening at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the southwestern desert, bringing with them the risk of heavy rainfall.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy rainfall on Monday and Tuesday from west Arizona to south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that only “ten tropical hurricanes have maintained a state of tropical storm or low pressure at a distance of 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 50-100 millimeters, with rainfall of up to 150 millimeters in some places on the Mogollin Ridge in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central rocky mountains and Great Basin, there is a verifiable yield of between 25 and 50 millilitres, with total rainfall of up to 100 millimetres in some places.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing in a drought-stricken area if there is no risk of heavy rainfall.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some rainfall can be beneficial because of severe droughts in the south-west.
According to the U.S. drought agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa makes an initial landing on the California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is still hurricane-strength at wind speeds of 135 kilometers per hour, moving north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its power when it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico during a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rainfall can be severe and pose a significant flood risk.
"From the California peninsula to the northwestern Sonora is expected to be 75-150 millimeters, and up to 250 millimeters is possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in a tropical low pressure during Tuesday morning hours. From there, she continues her journey through Arizona to southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The biggest risks for Rosa or its remains are associated with very heavy rainfall on the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Agency said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rains and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in an area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4 a.m.
He was taken to a hospital where he was said to be in “stable” condition.
Police said they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset during the night.
The police are asking for contact from anyone who may have video footage of the events recorded on their mobile phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Experienced “Badness and Anger” of Democratic Party
"My vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from the Democratic Party’s “vileness and indignation” throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, he vigorously and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual harassment that would have occurred decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also confirmed the allegations at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s excellence, character and courage” on that day.
“My vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh’s appointment is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time, with an outstanding merit in public service,” he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning to the fullest," he said.
"That's why I'm all over the place to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump said the Democrats had taken on the task of “resisting and blocking.”
A senior assistant to the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in the Kavanaugh nomination process is expected to be held in the Senate by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll expected to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people had died on Saturday after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of whom were wiped out by the gigantic waves that hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the festival on the shore of the town on Friday, when waves up to six metres high hit the shore at dusk. Many were washed to death as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by 7.5 magnitude earthquakes.
When the threat of a tsunami emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t immediately run away, and they were the victims,” said Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, but it was pulling cars, tree trunks, houses and hitting all over the country,” says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached a speed of 800 km/h in the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photos published by the disaster agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency for the assessment and application of technology (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It says that the terrain of a long, narrow town at the end of a bay may have swelled the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as “wide” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage could be greater on the coast 300 kilometers north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the quake.
Communications "are completely cut off, and no information has been received about Donggala," Nugroho says.
According to a statement issued by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not saying that a tsunami had hit the site, although authorities said the waves had arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of the building is shouting fervent warnings about an approaching tsunami to people on the street.
Just minutes later, a water wall hits the beach, taking buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately verify the authenticity of the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which cut communications around the island, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Officials say the army has begun sending aid from Jakarta and other cities by transport planes, but those evacuated still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city’s airport has been reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision’s Donggala staff has been rescued in the city of Pal, where they have been housed in the tent-cloths in the courtyard of the office. On their way, they passed the scene of destruction, Doseba says.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
As aid groups embarked on their desolating mission, some complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to return.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only start flowing once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"This is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As long as the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made."
When the second night came after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing were hoping that their loved ones would miraculously deviate from the gloomy story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was lifted from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in the ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian suspension team, had coached two missing suspension players for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mandagi said.
"As a senior member of the League, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says he has tried desperately to reach the beach festival’s competitors via WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the hangout community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one gray mark appeared, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves took <0x24>26,750 in ATM supplement at Newport on the Leve
The thieves took <0x24>26,750 from a Brink’s security worker on Friday morning while he was replenishing an ATM in Newport on the Leve, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been clearing and replenishing the ATM in the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
When Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, "your man ran behind him," who stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses said they saw several people fleeing the scene, but police did not specify their number.
Persons with information on their identities are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper Changes Name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The character that used to be known as Kanye West."
Ye has been the nickname of 41-year-old West for some time now, and he also used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change is ahead of his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release a new album called Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the show, canceled her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the word has religious meaning for him, in addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name.
While discussing the title of the album earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said he "believes that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you."
"So it's you, me, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in a shorter form, Ye - which only manifests the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything in us.
The album is mostly about thinking about who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he has announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West’s former partner, JAY-Z, has also occasionally removed and returned the intersection and uppercase letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approached the 50th anniversary of reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador, who performed at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, said he would “never use an army to oppress the Mexican people.”
Armed forces fired on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by offering monthly student aid and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education are driving young people into criminal gangs.
Connecting houses should double funding for artificial intelligence research
The U.S. should double its funding for AI research as China intensifies its operations in the sector, says Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI professional who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by announcements by various parts of the U.S. administration on AI, although the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: to become a leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee’s book “The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month through Houghton Mifflin’s Harcourt publishing house. He is the CEO of Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China’s most significant artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the top-ranked Othello player in the United States. Later, he held leadership positions at Microsoft Research and was the head of Google's China operations.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. researchers have worked hard to get public funding.
"Academic influencers are not exported by China, but by large corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee also said changes in immigration policies could help the United States intensify its AI efforts.
"I think doctoral graduates in artificial intelligence should be automatically awarded green cards," he said.
The Chinese Government’s next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House has announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative this month.
NSF invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative to establish a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence has not progressed in months.
Macedonians in referendum on changing country's name
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked the country's aspirations for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, considers the name of its northern neighbour to be in effect a territorial requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its membership of the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in a referendum, and the anti-vote campaign raises doubts as to whether the required 50% turnout will be reached in order for the result to be legal.
The question on the ballot paper was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by approving the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying the price so that Macedonia, which has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, can apply for membership in both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive impact.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the National Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16, compared to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of those entitled to vote cast their votes.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by boycotters of the referendum in front of the Skopje parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the kitchen door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, as part of Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour of the name change, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said the "yes" voice is "confirming our future."
An opinion poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research referred to a turnout of 30-43 percent in the referendum - that is, below the required turnout.
In another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote for the 'yes' option.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must exceed 50 per cent by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for a pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero beats Brighton’s entire defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his goal at 65 minutes look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the pattern, the Argentine top player got a pass from the midfield.
He found an empty space on the field by rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He missed one defender and then left behind several others on the edge of the Brighton Penalty Area.
He then found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed Brighton watchman Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot to the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that “Aguero has a problem with his feet.”
“We said he’d play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
“Fortunately, he scored at the time.”
However, Sterling had already given the azure blues an advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero took the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane took a few touches before sending the ball to the backpost towards Sterling.
The sky blue attacker pushed the ball into the net just before the end line.
City faces Hoffenheim Champions League in the group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a cheerleader in a game against the Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so why try to force them into the starting lineup?
However, as always competitive, Scherzer hopes to take over the pitching hill in Sunday's match against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff lead.
The Rockies scored at least a wild card with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
“Even if we don’t have a stake, we can at least get up to the pitching hill knowing that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team here in Denver will create for me the most demanding race that I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take on the challenge?”
The Nationals have not yet announced their start-up for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a chance in these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a rehearsal on Thursday, playing for 34 at the start of his match, and pitching on Sunday at his normal rest time.
Washington's right-handed player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season, with an ERA score of 2.53 and has burned the batter 300 times, with an innings score of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The president implicitly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh, who also spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
“All of our achievements will be at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the really great things -- not just campaigning, but campaigning to the fullest, and that's why I'm all over the place to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump added: “You see this terrible, terrible, radical Democratic group, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to the grip of power by any means necessary, so you can see their viciousness and malice.
They don't choose who they hurt or who they have to beat to get to power. That's what they want, power and power, but we don't give it to them."
He said the Democrats had taken on the task of "resisting and blocking".
"And it's been visible over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and malicious and false."
When he referred to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-acting Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the audience responded with loud booings.
“Do you remember his answer?
You leaked the document?
Eh, uh, what.
Well, uh, no, I'm waiting a bit - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinion.
I was not really surprised when the momentum activists in my local party supported the motion of censure against me.
After all, I'm just the last in line to be told that I'm not welcome - just because we say what we think.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because he was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism of my disagreement with Mr Corbyn.
On issues relating to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues, on which Mr Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The Labour Conference in Nottingham East said on Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years that I have worked as a local Labour representative, the Friday size of the party council has been exactly that.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone of voice, and a 'more friendly and gentle' policy has long been forgotten, if ever it began.
It is increasingly clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates divergent opinions and that every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues with whom I had thought I shared a similar political vision began to expect me to turn around and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to, be it national security or the EU's internal market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is a wave of insults on social media, calling for my election to be cancelled, for the rejection of centrist politics, and for me to hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
I really know that I am more fortunate than some of my fellow Members, because the comments that have been made to me are, at least, political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face daily sexist and racist insults and never waver.
The normalization of maltreatment is one of the most disturbing features of politics in this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for Labour to adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every motion of censure or change in the electoral code, the party becomes more limited.
For two years, I’ve been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that “everything goes well”.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the Government of Thatcher's negligence on the integrated school, I have been striving to promote better public services for those who need them most, both as a city councillor and as a minister.
I have never concealed my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the constituency of Nottingham East has been surprised by my points of view or my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards a Brexit that is damaging to households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my confidence in the Labour leadership.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible Ayr in block row
The last two goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undeniably deserved a victory in the day's entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of ten that has not lost a single match.
Great defense and more successful risk-taking were, after all, what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can rightly be satisfied.
"We've been challenged in our matches and we're still invincible, so I can be happy," he says.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie says, “All the credit to Ayr, they took risks better than we did.”
Ayr took the lead after 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Roy Hughes, handed over by the Warriors to the game, allowed Melrose to climb, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo increased Ayr's leadership with a penalty goal, and just before the halftime, he scored and managed a conversion kick, raising Ayr's leadership to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, whose conversion kick Baggot succeeded in narrowing the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with the goal of Stafford McDowall, whose conversion kick Climo succeeded.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, after which Melrose's Bruce Colvine scored a goal after heavy pressure, whose conversion kick was unsuccessful.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored a goal at the rear of Ayrin's maul.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong's kick and winged Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth goal.
Still Game star starts restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named as the director of a licensed restaurant company and is expected to start working in the restaurant industry as well.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, which he co-wrote with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he has been registered as a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper hinted that Kiernan wanted to be part of Glasgow’s thriving restaurant business.
'The sea belongs to us': landlocked Bolivia tries to reconnect with the Pacific through justice
Sailors patrolling outside a naval base in La Paz.
The flagpoles of public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Titicaca to the Amazon have been sloganed: "Justly, the sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to get it back.”
In Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century resource war is still strong – as is the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
Hope is at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has a strong faith in progress, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course a positive attitude in awaiting a final solution," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country are optimistic about the ruling of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague will support – after decades of discontinuous debate – Bolivia’s position that Chile has an obligation to grant independent access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic President Evo Morales, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, has a lot at stake in next Monday’s lineup.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia’s best interest, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The United Nations body of Dutch origin has no authority to cede Chilean territories, and the ICJ has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision is issued only six months after the last statements indicate that the case is "not complicated," says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Moreover, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivia's intentions.
"The current Bolivian regime has captured the issue of maritime connectivity," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
Morales’s controversial rhetoric has stifled the rest of the Chilean benevolence, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold talks afterwards.
There has been no embassy in either country since 1962.
The former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the Court's decision was exceptionally swift.
Monday will give Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit.”
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to connect to the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to understand that it’s time for us to move on from the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can rely on the United States
“North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington,” North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States of the commitments made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin’s statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is resuming deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the U.S. met with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a “distant dream” to believe that prolonged sanctions and the US’s opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Until Pyongyang has taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is alert to the adoption of the Declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the notion that Pyongyang was about to abandon the arsenal of weapons, which the state probably sees as the only real way to guarantee its own security, has been widely questioned.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest collection of large headgear, which will soon be on your street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you don’t have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled at their SS19 collection show a selection of extraordinary super-big headgear that dazzled the Paris Fashion Week style circles.
Very impractical headgear took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino’s most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feather, which almost completely covered the ends of the models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelon decorated with jewels, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple —but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creature with a snorkel and a mask was more like a dive gear, and the other was more like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for big fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion followers predict that huge scarves will appear in the street scene.
Oversized hats closely follow "La Bomba", a straw hat with a half-metre rim that has been seen in all areas from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult fame of the impractical hat, which was widely seen on social media, also swept another large creation into fashion shows – a beach bag made of straw that is almost as big as the model carrying it.
The raffine bag with white leather hand straps was the most striking creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the street next summer – the designers have made such an impression that it would be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: language skills are a key skill for a global citizen
Scottish private schools have traditionally had good learning outcomes, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. Success has been amplified by individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools with more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), aim to provide a high level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for their chosen careers, for graduate and higher education, and for world citizenship.
As an educational sector operator that can design and implement tailored study content, we have noticed the status of languages as a popular and desirable subject in educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, the message will go to his head.
If you speak to a person in his or her own language, the message will go to his or her heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relationships of trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s most recent test results, we can see that languages are at the top of the list in terms of the pass rate among private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade A.
The data were collected from 74 schools belonging to SCIS, and it was found that 72% of the pupils who received the highest grade A studied Mandarin Chinese, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are valued in the same way as natural science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school curriculum and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Employment Office in 2014, 17 per cent of situations where an employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee were explained by lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore all the more necessary for the future career development of young people.
The more language skills are required for potential jobs, the more relevant these skills become in a global world.
If a person has studied a second language, he or she will have an advantage over this lifelong skill in the future, regardless of the career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts the language-speaking person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent of over 4,000 UK adults are unable to communicate in a foreign language, and French was the only language that could be spoken by a two-digit number of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
In particular, knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance of finding meaningful careers.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are supposed to be important to British people in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, private schools always have a number of language options taught by specialized teachers.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
In this time, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment,languages will continue to be of great importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high standard to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the SCIS of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron debuts in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for LeBron James to make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego before the start of the season.
But how many minutes he actually plays, remains to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for incomplete minutes.
James was asked earlier this week about his plans for six games with the Lakers before the end of the season.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any more pre-matches to prepare," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will start a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of five election events planned for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote awaits his election to fill a vacant position as a Supreme Court judge, Trump seeks to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing a majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump’s Wheeling event in West Virginia starts at 7 p.m. East Coast on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia Campaign Event online as a live stream via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who became heated over allegations of sexual harassment that have delayed the Senate’s confirmation vote for as long as a week while the FBI is investigating allegations.
But the primary goal of the series of campaigns is to support Republican candidates’ success in the tight November elections.
“The purpose of these five events in the next week is to wake up volunteer and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Managing the congress is so essential to his purposes that the president is willing to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today’s venue is the Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, where supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh, can be found, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit to West Virginia this month, where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump backs Republican senator Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind in polls.
"For Morrisey, it's not a good sign that the president is trying to increase his support in polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Fighting Will to Maintain Hope Before Sunday's Singles Games
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon doubles were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-reinforcing power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this.
Where, according to them, is this power of success at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we take this power of success as a little bit," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage: four points ahead and 12 to play.
Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a bit of wind in the sails and a lot of encouragement, like the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play all day together and score three out of four points.
Spieth has been superior to brick to green, and leads by example.
The hoarse throat sounds of the Victory Celebration intensified as his lap progressed, as he succeeded in a critical put to level the match exactly to four when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
Putin, with whom they won the 15th game, was followed by a similar cry, which gave the impression that he believed that the U.S. team had not yet lost.
"You have to focus really well and just take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left.
18 holes to make an effect.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed Ryder Cup legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe’s special, but adorable, duo has won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only duo who didn't make any bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and receive energy from this furious audience, confirms that they are Sunday’s pre-favorites. And when the sun goes down at Le Golf National, there could not be another more popular player to ensure a possible victory for Europe than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time with different holes.
However, the talk of Europe's success is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, who paired up with Alex Noren, the hero of the morning's doubles game.
One bogi and two double bogi in the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede so deep that they weren’t even close to surviving.
But on Sunday, no one's going to help you get out of the hole.
Four-ball and doubles are fascinating to follow closely from the point of view of couples’ cooperation: what kind of advice they give or don’t give, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a prominent lead before the last day, but this doubles showed that the United States team has a will to fight, even though it has been suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes 10-6 lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is well in the lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup after taking 10-6 lead positions in Saturday’s four-ball and four-game games from the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the victory parade with two victories over the rapper Tiger Woods, and scored a high score of four today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, which worked hard to maintain its loss at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the weakly played U.S. team in the morning's four-ball game, taking the match to a 3-1 position.
The United States was a tougher opponent in the quadruples, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points out of Sunday's 12 singles to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to have won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also collectively referred to as "Molliwood", were the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup to have won four points in the first four games.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they then finalized the overwhelmingly discouraged Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau even more vigorously 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through two games on Saturday, was at times very brilliant, but has nevertheless lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and doubles, and even seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested in the morning's four balls, but returned to doubles with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day southwest of Paris.
Triple scoring champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the U.S. by two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2-1 victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, and later a 4-3 victory against Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a doubles game after losing the first two holes.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has risen from a four-point chase position to levels at the start of the doubles, although on the Furyk side, even a draw is enough to keep the win.
However, after two days of being the second best, it may be that Sunday’s counterattack is too much to ask for.
North Korea "definitely" disarms itself without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the continued sanctions only increased distrust of the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that over the past year, North Korea has taken "significant benevolent measures" such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising that North Korea will not increase the amount of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure that national security will be preserved, so under these circumstances, unilateral disarmament is not possible.”
While Ri reiterated the familiar whistleblower that Washington does not approve of a phasing out of nuclear weapons in which North Korea would be rewarded for every intermediary, his statement is nevertheless significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not entirely ruled out, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the sitting US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, in which Kim assured the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also been opposed to the imposition of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States is calling for “nuclear disarmament first,” and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force—even opposing the “declaration of peace,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions would bring us to our knees is a dream of the indifferent.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions only deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea were the party calling for disarmament, not the United States, the situation would not have progressed into such a deadlock.”
Yet Rin’s tone was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the launch of missiles to the United States toward continental areas was inevitable after “bad president” Trump called Kim a “missile man with suicidal intentions.”
Last year, Trump threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, but this year, he praised Kim for his courage in approaching disarmament, but stressed that there is still a lot of work to be done and that the sanctions should remain until North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no time limit: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia urged the UN Security Council to reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “strengthening the Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be strong and unsuccessful until we have witnessed a complete, definitive and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea since 2006 with the aim of stopping Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile production funding channels.
Mr Pompeo met with Mr Rin of North Korea at the United Nations General Assembly and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go smoothly.
While leaving Pyongyang, he described progress, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster-like demands" only a few hours later.
North Korea undertook to shut down the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month, in case the U.S. takes “similar measures.”
According to Pompeo, Kim means “with equivalent measures” the security guarantees that Trump committed to at the Singapore meeting, and moving towards a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an adequate rest instruction course
This year, all undergraduate students at Harvard University take part in a course designed to increase student rest, a countermeasure to the university’s thriving macho culture, where students weigh long nights with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite ignorant about the basics of their own well-being.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard University who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and believes the course will be the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after he lectured on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, ‘Why do I hear about it now, in my last year of school?’
No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which I thought was surprising," he said in an interview with the Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, will guide students on how proper sleep habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of medicine at Harvard University and deputy director of health services at the university, said the university had ended up hosting the course after hearing how students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the study week.
The one-hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
One section presents a picture of a dormitory room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
With interactive icons, the campus map encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that this has no direct impact on student behavior.
We believe, however, that they have a right to know about these things just as much as they have a right to know about the health effects of smoking,” Professor Czeisler adds.
All-night study marathons are still a matter of pride, according to Professor Czeisler, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
"Getting adequate and quality sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even against weight gain because sleep deprivation causes a state of hunger in the brain, which is why a person is constantly hungry," the professor notes.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology in California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
He says that the course opened his eyes and gave an impetus to arranging a comprehensive course for all students on the campus.
He hopes that all postgraduate students will be able to complete a similar course of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students also set an alarm clock to remind them of bedtime in addition to waking up in the morning, and urges them to bear in mind the adverse effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting on circadian rhythms, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot took the victory from Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced yet another losing day when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 victory.
The Ibrox players were looking for their first win since February 4–1 against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team won this time, and Gerrard only experienced his second defeat in his 18-game manager career. The Rangers were eight points away from the current Premier League leader, the Hearts.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before the halftime, and the Rangers' downed will to fight did not equalize the situation any more.
The Rangers dropped to sixth place in the game, while Livingston climbed to third place, and Hibernia was the only other player in the gap.
The Rangers may also have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object was thrown from the guest spectacle hit his head, and the wound had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up with which the team had defeated Ayr and advanced to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 team that took a point from the Hearts last week. The same strategy once again yielded results when a well-built team managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situation to his advantage.
Livingston had a chance to score two minutes later, when Menga's first assist gave Scott Pittman a clear path to Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but the other defender, Alan Lithgow, only managed to shoot wide into the rear post.
The Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but in the last trimester of the game there was no self-confidence.
Alfredo Morelos demanded a penalty after he and Steven Lawless had collided at fifteen minutes, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly effortlessly rebuffed Lassana Coulibaly's rifle and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston’s goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but it wasn’t just because of the team’s hard work.
The Rangers couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long pitching tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pitched to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly escorted the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
During the interchange, Gerrard decided to replace Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the pitch. The interchange affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack was interrupted by Kelly's impact on his fast defense.
Livingston made the visitors play their own game again as Lithgow and Halkett continued their long passes one after another.
Holt's team had an opportunity to raise their lead in the last moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could reach his position at the corner.
Glenn Middleton from the Rangers also demanded a penalty kick after fighting with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanakka: Geiger meter inventor
On September 30, 1882, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a device known as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the metric also became a central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film Coronado's Watches, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans portray scientists who seem to be cowboys, is well suited:
The man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter. It's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your headphones in your ears, you can actually hear the effects of radioactive radiation on minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's really rattling now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System to 'See' Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and altered in the laboratory
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the proteins that are typical for many people who eat.
The test vaccine has yielded promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, a patient with ovarian cancer lost cancer cells within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method involves the isolation of resistant cells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the HER2 proteins that are typical of many cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: “Our results show that this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of several types of cancer," Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer as well as cancers of the ovaries, lungs and colon."
A similar approach —taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells— has also yielded results in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West has been criticized for praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West received booings on Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump and announcing that he would run for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song "Ghost Town" on Trump's "Make America Great Again" campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he’s a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West's hype was not broadcast live, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded a snippet of it to social media.
It's unclear if Rock intends to make fun of West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been mistreated because of a hat he had worn behind the scenes.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat on.
I've been bullied!
Then they'll say I'm on the margin," West said in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see what it means to be on the margins?" and says he's wearing a Superman cape, because "then you can't control what I do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
According to Variety, West's comments sparked booing from the audience at least twice, and the show's performers looked embarrassed. One of the attendees described the situation to the newspaper as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was short-termly selected to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion among many viewers by performing the song "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from Conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who praised his courage on Twitter: “Thank you for taking the risk.”
But Karen Hunter, the head of the talk show, tweeted that West is "just himself, which is absolutely wonderful."
“However, I can choose to BE UNSUPPORTED by a person (by buying his music or clothing brand or by supporting his ‘art’) who I believe supports and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us,” he added.
The rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to “the person previously known as Kanye West.”
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
The second rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast Restaurant Knife Accused of Attempted Murder
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after he was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in the Ballypackamore area, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before a Belfast court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, Harrington has attacked the stereotype of a macho hero: according to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned by hard work.
In an interview with the Sunday Times’ cultural appendix, Harrington suspects that “something has gone wrong” and questions the methods used to address toxic masculinity in the era of the <0x23>MeToo phenomenon.
Recently, Harrington, who has also been married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, a member of the Game of Thrones Star Guards, admits that he has a strong desire to intervene.
“The question of where we’ve gone wrong with masculinity is currently arousing strong feelings in me,” he says.
"What have men been taught in the years of their growth that have led to the problems that are now noticeable?"
Harrington believes that television and the highly masculine characters in it are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be a certain kind of man to be a man?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time – how can we change this?
There is something really wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admits that he would not be involved in the production of the prequel or sequel to the Throne Game after the series ends next summer, as he has “enough of battlefields and horses,” according to his own words.
In November, Harrington appears in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of the film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife, Rose, was the best the Throne Game has ever offered him.
“I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on,” she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the love of Harrington-starred Jon Snow, in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estates in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through contaminated blood transfusions in parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV infections are an acute issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many infections are due to insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to guarantee universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking Republican Senator's information and accuses her of spreading "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied on Saturday allegations that her employee had published personal information about three Republican Senators on Wikipedia’s pages about them.
A Democrat from Los Angeles said the allegations were spread by “extreme right-wing” commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the reported figures were the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
An unidentified person released the information on Thursday from the U.S. Congress during a hearing in the Senate committee on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that, according to Hill’s newspaper, the messages were published from an IP address attached to the Waters office and by a Waters staff member.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and it is an absolute lie," Water said.
"My employee whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations shall in no way be liable for the leakage of such information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized on the internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," Fleischer wrote.
"It seems that his character does not suit a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they have no reason to be hostile.
There's no reason for arrogance.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to behave calmly and calmly.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday’s hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters in the mid-term elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"I can't believe this is true," he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that he had contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies in response to these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for any destructive and dangerous actions against some or all of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again – underpowered Rowan Atkinson agent parody
It is already a well-established tradition to look for Brexit references in any film that tilts slightly to the UK, but this does not seem to fit the Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series that started in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life with the 2011 sequel "Johnny English – Born Again".
Can the language of the nation’s cheek-made satire become Britain’s new national export success?
Whatever the case, Johnny English, who is a prickly-eyed, rubber-faced and incompetent, has already earned his permission to screw up for the second time. His name says above all that it is a comedic creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
Of course, it’s that stupid secret agent who desperately tries to breathe the melting glamour around him, but appears to be a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and that unfortunate one-note musician at the 2012 opening concert in London.
The character is based on a cosmopolitan and mystical man of the world who left pure chaos, originally portrayed by Atkinson in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s physical comedy gifts come out, but the humor itself seems inefficient and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ film brands like 007 and Dangerous Quest now provide humor as part of the film’s core content.
Humor seems to be aimed at children, and Johnny English’s insane treatment doesn’t seem as inventive and sharp-sighted to me as Atkinson’s Mr. Bean’s mykkarol comedy.
The starting point, which is repeated every year, is that the UK is in trouble for the most part.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a top-secret spy network in the UK and uncovered the identities of every British agent in the field to the astonishment of an active agent – which is portrayed as an unfortunately small role performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a numb and troubled prime minister who is already in the mud of political dislike: Emma Thompson is doing everything in the skin of Teresa May’s parody character, but the script just doesn’t give her enough space.
When the intelligence advisers inform him that all the spies in the field have been discovered, it is necessary to summon someone who has already retired from active service.
Of course, Johnny English is a narcissist in his own person. He spends his retirement as a teacher at a high school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble art of espionage. The subject catches some witty jokes; English holds School of Rock-type lessons for the secrets of intelligence.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he meets his endlessly patient combat partner, Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, whose role Vicki Pepperdine doesn’t seem to get to her right.
So the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of his majesty to face the fateful super criminal Ophelia Bhuletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, Jason Volta, portrayed by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
The English and Bough odyssey turns into a farce: the two, disguised as waitresses, set fire to a fancy French restaurant and create chaos while secretly striving for Volta’s luxury yacht. The attempt to explore Volta’s house with virtual glasses ends in pure anarchy in the real world.
The authors’ last blocks are crippling when they come to the final scene, but despite all the clumsiness and charm, the film still feels a bit made for a children’s audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
When I watch Johnny English movies, I’ve come to the same conclusion before: why isn’t the British film industry able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
UK Labour denies plans for four-day work week with five-day pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, speculates on a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but pay for five days.
The party is said to demand that business leaders pass on the savings of the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
The plan would allow employees to enjoy three-day weekends on equal pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit into the party’s economic programme and its plans to inflate politics for the benefit of the workers.
The trade union federation supports the move to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A high-level Labour source told the Sunday Times: "The revision of the line is expected to be announced before the turn of the year.
The change will not happen in an instant, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the Party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the Party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the Green Party in Britain pledged to support the move to a four-day work week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, this objective will not receive undivided support in the ranks of the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a party policy, and the party is not considering moving to one.”
John McDonnell, the shadow government’s finance minister, used last week’s Labour Conference to present his vision for the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from “ungrowth dictators” and “speculators” of utility companies.
According to the shadow government’s finance minister’s plans, the current shareholders of the water companies would not be able to regain their shares in full, as the Labour-led government would be able to implement “reductions” on the basis of detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on boards of directors of companies and to create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to the management of employees, with a maximum of <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends paid to an individual employee per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on the 60 Minutes show discuss whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The investigation into the charges against FBI judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week in the final vote on Kavanaugh’s appointment as a Supreme Court judge, and raises the question whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican Senators for Kavanaugh’s appointment.
In the 60 Minutes episode on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the program’s correspondent, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any chance the FBI could find out things that could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said on my way to the hearing... I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, I called him when the charges came up, and I asked him, ‘Did you do that?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to have been cut into stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's bomb-proof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people he named could confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old issue.
I don’t see what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, held in New York on Saturday, is a music event with a cast as impressive as its mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now held for the seventh time, attracts tens of thousands of people to the lawns of New York Central Park to listen to performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to promote the true goal of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively working to eradicate poverty.
To get a free ticket to an event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform a variety of tasks or "deeds", such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision-maker or making a call, or performing any other act that promotes awareness of the project's goals.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded, now that we only have 12 years to reach this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clictivism’ among others – the illusion that you can change the world by signing an online address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “deeds” for various purposes since 2011.
According to the report, these actions have encouraged policymakers to announce commitments and principles equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion, which have been spent in a way that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations that have already led to more than <0x24>10 billion being spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executives committed to “helping children develop to their full potential”. The group committed to providing <0x24>35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country after activists had sent them 4,700 tweets following the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries, and just the people of the world like you, we can pass the history of social injustice and malnutrition to the newspapers," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British government was also urged to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children through more than 5,000 actions. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which focuses on combating malnutrition and reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions in the Frequently Asked Questions section of the movement’s website is, “Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?”
Global citizen’s response: “The road will be long and difficult and there will be many stumbling blocks ahead of us.
We will succeed, however, like the great civil rights struggles and the anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we will be stronger.”
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the New York concert this year, and its starry cast includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e.
U.S. Department of Home Affairs says it could make energy exports more difficult by using the navy as a "barrier"
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner, said Washington could “recourse to the aid of its fleet if necessary” to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s actions in Syria – at the invitation of the legitimate government – are an excuse for exploring new energy markets in the region.
“I believe that the reason for [Russia’s] presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as it is in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe,” Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
“The United States has the ability to keep shipping routes open through its fleet and, if necessary, by embarking to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up on the world market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the public at an event organised by the Energy Consumers' Association, a non-profit group that profiles itself as a "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that this is one and the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another," he says, describing Russia as a "one-trick circus number" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statement comes at a time when the Trump administration has tried to boost LNG exports to Europe and replace significantly cheaper Russian LNG.
To intensify this, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which President Trump says will tie Berlin to Moscow’s leash.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the 110 billion cubic metres of transmission capacity of the existing pipeline, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington’s opposition, and considers it an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers must have the choice of supplier," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has provoked a retaliatory reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industrial umbrella organisation, the Confederation of German Industries, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third country interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry, said after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, a Senator from Massachusetts, is going to think carefully about running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think carefully" about running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy at an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and repair our defective regime, and that also means a woman at the head of the kingdom," he said.
"After the sixth of November, I will think carefully about running for President."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying that “he is taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren wrote, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
However, according to a poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren’s voters do not support this candidacy in 2020.
According to a study by the University of Suffolk Department of Political Studies and the Boston Globe, 58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts do not support a senator’s candidacy.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of running for office.
More respondents were in favour of the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick by 38%, while 48% were against the idea.
Other prominent candidates for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will officially decide on his nomination by January.
Sarah Palin points to her son's war traumas at Donald Trump's election rally
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military in September.
Track Palin arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence
"From what my own son has to go through when he returns home, I can identify with other families who have to face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our returning soldiers carry," he told an audience gathered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at Donald Trump's election rally.
Palin called the arrest “a hippo in the living room” and said his son, like other war veterans, “will return home a little changed, they will return hardened, they will return wondering whether he and his comrades in the army and air force will be respected for what he has done for this country.”
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday, and was charged with domestic violence and assault against her, as well as domestic violence and handling of the gun intoxicated, according to Wasilla Police spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 States and District of Columbia Support New Asylum Lawsuit
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are seeking an amendment to the new policy of not granting asylum to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and federal districts have filed a "Friends of Justice" letter in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who violate the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
He says his partner "and his sons belonging to a violent gang" assaulted him, and was denied asylum by US authorities on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The attorney general who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of which are U.S. asylum seekers, as countries where gang violence and domestic violence are a widespread problem at all levels of society.
The new US asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Asylum Appeals Board that undocumented migrants could apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “is ignoring state, federal, and international law for decades.”
"Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be decided on the basis of facts and circumstances specific to the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," says the letter "Friends of the Right."
The prosecutors also argue in the letter that the practice of preventing asylum seekers from entering harms the U.S. economy, as the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "bring the necessary additional workforce."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered entry judges to suspend asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is intended for persons fleeing their home country on the grounds of racial, religious, national or social origin, or persecution or fear caused by political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even the serious ones – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue of survivors continues in Palu – the number of found dead has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she calms her fevered baby at the evacuation center in the ruined city of Kira.
"Ambulances bring in new bodies minute by minute.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered-down belongings and try to save what remains to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Please Army Hospital, where patients are treated for constant, severe aftershocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he repeats how a violent earthquake shook a fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save.
I got stuck between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris says, according to Associated Press, and tells me that he and his family were in town as wedding guests.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "provoking" with "propaganda"
The U.S. Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after the Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily that praised the mutual benefits of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to a paid supplement to the China Daily in the newspaper Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the 6th of November congressional elections.
Trump’s allegations of Beijing’s attempts to interfere in the U.S. election mean a new phase in Washington’s expanding campaign to put pressure on China, according to US officials who spoke to Reuters.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread notices to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-increasing trade war, in which both sides in turn impose tariffs on their counterparts’ exports.
According to Chinese and American experts, China’s retaliatory tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party at the start of the trade war.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and long-time Governor of Iowa, says Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China is now “intensifying its provocations further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press,” Branstad wrote in an opinion article published Sunday in the Des Moines Register.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the esteemed U.S. tradition of free speech and press by placing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the newspaper kiosks on the streets of Beijing, divergent opinions are seen only in limited numbers, and real, divergent opinions that Chinese citizens may have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all. This is because the media is firmly in the lead of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that “one of China’s largest newspapers evaded an offer to publish” the article he wrote, but did not specify which newspaper it was about.
Kavanaugh fiasco bans female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the Republican top names are standing behind and defending Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh could, according to analysts, cause a counter-reaction, especially among female voters in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions surrounding the incident have gone through a lot of rounds, and most Republicans have already declared their willingness to proceed with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell Institute at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher doesn’t believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republican, Arizona)’s last-minute offer of an FBI investigation will appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokeswoman for the National Reform Group MoveOn, according to a newspaper in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, demonstrators sang “November is coming” in protest in the corridors of the Senate as the ruling Republicans of the Judiciary Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be quantifiable," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in an interview with the news site.
“People say the excitement has already been high, and it’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among precarious female voters in suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if the Republicans proceed with the confirmation even before Ford’s testimony against the Supreme Court candidate in which he made his allegations of sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put to questioning. It's about how the Republicans have acted on the matter and how they've treated Ford," Guy Cecil, the leader of the Democratic-backed Priorities USA group, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided as to whether they should entrust Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony to the latter’s leaning on the narrow majority.
According to a new poll conducted by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% say they absolutely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake pushed the case forward, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one of the others, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the court that Kavanaugh had harassed him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate revealed his genitals to him at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new Internet as a counterattack to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what data.
In an interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes about Inrupt’s intention to “govern the world.”
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “personal data repository” (POD).
It can include contact lists, memory lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about a personal data repository is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt’s idea is to provide the resources, processes and skills required to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently comprises Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM’s security platform, some of the project’s hired developers, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website. All this will be available from this week.
Berners-Lee says he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change in which all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
“We’re not asking for their consent.”
In a paper published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “task is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the integrity and quality of the new network built for Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: city commemorates World War I hero priest
The city is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Church of England’s only Victoria Cross medal-winning military priest.
The Medal of Courage was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 for the events of the attack on the villages of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, Vann was shot four days later by a sniper, never knowing of the highest honor he had received from the British Army.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "impressively symbolic"; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather's feat.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quenti "in a very dense fog and under fire from heavy field guns and machine guns."
Later, he plunged into the front line and, "with the greatest bravery," led the advance of the troops before attacking the field cannon alone. In the subsequent battle, Vann swept down with his own hands three of the gunner's soldiers.
Colonel Vann died on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s act was “something I could never achieve, something that evokes respect.”
Michael Vann He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a wreath after a parade orchestrated by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it’s “a great honor to be part of the parade” and adds, “a great crowd is remembering the honor of a true hero.”
Friends of the match waited all night for Bellator 206 – TV show showed Pipsa Pig
Imagine a situation where you’ve been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament and the whole event isn’t being played.
The event in San Jose featured 13 matches, including six main series matches, and the show was scheduled to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK.
At six o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the show changed to a huge shock to Pipsa Possu’s viewers.
Some of the spectators weren’t exactly happy to stay up all night because of the match.
A friend of the match opened up on Twitter, describing the replacement of the match with a cartoon children's "some kind of sick joke."
"According to the law, that content was not appropriate to be presented at six o'clock in the morning, so they had to exchange it for a children's program," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, explained.
"Pipsa Pig, yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said the schedules will be worked on so that British viewers can follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking about a re-broadcast that's probably going to make the program work," Coker said.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. there, and we can't do the show before Sunday, which is Monday for them.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, the messages started to go one way and the other, and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to correct the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case; it was a matter of legislation.
I can promise you that next time this will not happen.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual, and we tried to offer our fans more and we tried too much.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
The 24-year-old says he only found out when he was in high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on Lauren Laverne's "Desert Island Discs" channel, Daley said she spoke about gay rights to give 'hope' to others.
He also explains that after having a child, winning the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a long-time radio presenter, has taken several months off due to illness.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else at a young age because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and jobs."
“To this day, these feelings of feeling less and different have been a reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I needed to succeed.”
He says he wanted to show that he’s ‘something’ so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when his sexuality was finally revealed.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and will appear at this year’s Commonwealth Games pleading for the criminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion reveals his love for a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – as a “surprise to come.”
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things at such a young age," he said at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, "it's hard to find another person of the same age who has experienced the same kind of adversity and adversity," Daley said.
The couple had a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which Daley’s “whole perspective” has changed.
“If you’d asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning a gold medal,” he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than a gold Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after Daley’s father, who died in 2011 of brain cancer at the age of 40.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Daley was about admission to the 2012 Olympics. He wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he’s not going to be there anymore to be in the front row,” Daley says.
"I held her hand when her breathing stopped. Only when her breathing had really stopped and she was dead, I finally realized that she was not invulnerable," she says.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew this was something I’ve been dreaming about all my life – jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” Daley says.
This was also the inspiration for her first song selection on the show – Heather Small’s song “Proud” – which was emotionally aroused already as she was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gets her skin on chicken.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Half-way to Mickelson's exchange bench at Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to make a lot of mistakes to avoid a record-breaking turn in history as an unfortunate performance.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the record 12th time, was replaced by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome.
The American five-time Major tournament winner, who is usually the center of attention, now spent half the day as a cheerleader and half the day on the pitch trying to get his punches under control.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who wasn’t even considered one of the most accurate drivers at the height of his career, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field, where a long-grown roughman punishes for inaccurate punches.
If Mickelson doesn’t have enough opponents on the pitch, Sunday’s ninth game will be hosted by renowned British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who will play alongside rookie Tommy Fleetwood, who is aiming to win all four wins this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind by the time they enter the 12 singles game, get a flying start, Michelson’s game can prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else can he say.
"He fully understands the role he played today. He patted me on the back, squeezed me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I imagined something else, but this is how it went, and this is the solution we came to.
He wants to be on the field as much as anyone else.”
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for more Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could also mark the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but according to Furyk, his presence brings something indefinable to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke at the expense of people, and he’s a funny guy that everyone likes to be around,” she explains.
"The younger players must have had a lot of fun with him this week, too, and it's funny to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long a leadership position can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the Ryder Cup’s vast lead before the last day’s singles can become a bumpy journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who won with just a few slashes of his nose and won with the narrowest margin possible141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"It reminds itself of how we led briskly in Valderrama, we led briskly in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit barely," Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team's 5–3 wins both Friday and yesterday, moving to the 10–6 lead at Le Golf National.
“History will show me and all the other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game isn't over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and that is all we are aiming for.
As I’ve always said, I focus on the 12 players who play on our side, but we’re aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with how his team’s players have fared in a difficult field, Bjorn adds: “I never lick until I fall down on things like this.
Tomorrow is a completely different thing.
Tomorrow, we will prioritize individual performances, and then we will talk about different things.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when everything is going well, but when you’re alone on the field, the player’s capacity is tested down to the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be conveyed to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to perform at their best.
Now we have to give up a partner who can go [to the field alone] and do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, Captain Jim Furyk of the opposing team expects players to perform better than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced last-day turnarounds in both directions. He was a member of the Brookline-winning team before he ended up a loser when the European team won "Medinah by a miracle".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw stretched out his team lines to the test of the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start, just like we did at Brookline, or like we did at Medinah.
When you move in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We’ve adjusted our line-up accordingly and put the boys on the pitch the way we want, as you know, we’re going to do miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the defensive battle and faces Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the next to face their European opponents.
"I put the group's friends in this order because I think it carries through the whole tournament," Bjorn said in a statement.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The newest frigate of the German navy should have been in service in 2014 to replace the obsolete Cold War fleet, but it will not be in service until next year due to faulty systems and exponentially rising costs, local media reports.
According to a military spokesman for Die Zeit, the launch of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the first ship of the new frigate class Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying after-sales problems have haunted the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
According to the available information, they will be equipped with effective cannons, missile systems for combating aircraft and surface vessels, as well as stealth technologies such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature of the ship is its longer service interval – new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without occasionally visiting their home port.
However, the constant delays mean that warships at the forefront of technology —which are said to be designed to enhance German influence in overseas territories— are outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unlucky F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a ship has been returned by the Navy.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but there has been talk in the German media of essential “software and hardware failures” that make the warship unfit for combat missions.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the size of the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class ships is around 120, which is only half the size of the crews of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the vessel is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's ability to make subsequent upgrades.
With a capacity of 7,000 tons, Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the equivalent class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the price tag for the whole project is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have risen to a staggering sum of EUR 3.1 billion, compared to an initial price of EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with access to new frigates have emerged as the German naval power has recently been warned of shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, pointed out earlier this year that the navy’s usable vessels “are running low”.
According to the authorities, the problem has grown over time because old ships have been decommissioned, but no new ones have been delivered.
He regretted that no Baden-Württemberg-class frigate could be deployed to the navy.
Environmental organization eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
The new study is hoped to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to guide future conservation measures.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, observes moths and dwarf frogs, as well as ear mites and water flies in the area of Inverewe Garden, a botanical garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special recording devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
The organization’s employees and volunteers also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequency of the votes and the species in question are verified by expert analysis.
Based on the results, a habitat map and a report are created, in which the behaviour of bats can be shown in an image that follows the area’s scale.
Rob Dewar, the organization’s conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how different species exploit them.
The information will help to plan habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking into account bats and related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain has declined considerably over the last 100 years.
Construction and excavation work threatens the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly papers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to night-time hunting practices, their ears are more useful for catching prey than their eyes.
Bats use advanced echo tracking technology to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organization dedicated to the protection of the rural environment that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens, and 76,000 acres of land across the country – and they take algae seriously.
It employs ten experts who carry out regular surveys, inspections of resting areas and, in some cases, animal rescue operations.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only conservation area dedicated exclusively to bat protection on the lands of the Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species are found.
According to farm manager David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave fits bats very well," he says.
“We have old buildings and trees, and overall a good living environment.
We don’t know everything about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of checking the buildings for bats before undertaking any remedial work, as the unintentional destruction of one of the bat resting places can cause the death of up to 400 female bats and chicks and eradicate an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and it is forbidden to kill, disturb or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Flea Conservation Organization, encourages the public to participate in the conservation work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't yet know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as “fake news” and says people want to “advertise themselves” using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim <0x24>375,000 for his silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram for 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made. The 33-year-old footballer vehemently denied the allegations and described them as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player continued smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they have called, according to the Reuters news agency, "unworthy reporting of suspected privacy concerns."
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is demanding "compensation for mental suffering depending on the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have met at a nightclub and entered the player’s room where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was “99 percent good guy,” but that “one percent” was disappointing.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later reached a compromise because she was "terrified by the possibility of revenge" and worried "that she would be subjected to public humiliation."
The 34-year-old now claims he is seeking the annulment of the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to a deal to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus on a <0x24>100 million contract.
Brexit: Britain 'should regret forever' end of car manufacturing
Britain would "repent forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "concerned" by the announcement by Toyota's UK unit to temporarily suspend production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese automaker says the impact of border delays will be visible as a loss of jobs if Brexit is reached without a deal.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis are produced, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a disruption in the production of our plant," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota's Burnaston unit.
Other UK-based car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about exiting the European Union about how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini factory for a month in the event of Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the main concern concerns the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a timely JOT principle, with parts arriving at the plant every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and the cars being made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, this could cause disturbances at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It is impossible to keep a warehouse lasting more than 24 hours at the Derbyshire plant, Toyota said, and production would be suspended.
Clark says Theresa May’s plan for EU relations is “precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border.”
"We need an agreement, we want the best possible agreement, which not only means success in the current situation, but is an opportunity that we need to take advantage of," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers’ statements show that we absolutely need to be able to continue the supply chain series that have worked very well so far.”
Toyota can’t say how long production will be stopped, but it warns that additional costs will reduce the company’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and works as a trade union clerk at the factory, says there is growing concern among members: "In my experience, lost jobs will never return.
A government spokesman said: "We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “have to be postponed for another week” due to an obligation around Supreme Court justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia’s interference in the elections, the connections of Trump’s assistants to Russia, and any actions the president may take to obstruct justice.
There have been rumours in Washington for months that Trump is going to dismiss the Deputy Attorney General, which would jeopardize Mueller’s impartiality of the investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been discussing the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of firing the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the meeting was supposed to be about Rosenstein's resignation.
At the time, however, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York, so the date of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "not preferably" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its timing coincided with a Senate hearing on the Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press chief Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News' Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said: "There is no set date for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for another week due to everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court at the moment.
We will see, but I always want to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reason for the lack of press conferences was due to reasons other than disgust at the “attention” of TV journalists, but said, “I don’t deny the fact that they are attention-seeking.”
Sanders, however, suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more questioning hours than any president before him," he says, adding further evidence without quoting: "We have checked those numbers."
"Press conferences will still be held," Sanders said, "but it is infinitely better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We often try to do so, and you have seen us do so many times over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences with visiting delegates.
Standing alone at a press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the President pointed out a possible reason for this when he appeared uninhibited and, from time to time, strangely to the journalists who had gathered there.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to employees of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) about fears of Brexit.
The Minister of Health has written a letter to employees of the Scottish health system from EU countries expressing their gratitude and hopes for staying in the country after Brexit.
A letter was sent by Jeane Freeman, a Scottish MEP, in less than six months' time for the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of applications for "established status" by EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes: “During the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we value the contribution of each of our employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery for head injury
Tennessee State Tigers backer Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team lost 31–27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee reporter Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the halftime.
"He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sidelines before placing him on a stretcher and taking him away for a more detailed assessment.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been discharged from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/extent of the injury at this stage," and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays for the first time in a team since his transfer from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when buying properties in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying properties in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, according to the Conservative Party’s new plans.
The purpose of the change is to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase of stamp duty applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce a higher stamp tax rate for foreign buyers when they buy properties in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby’s efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper housing and paid attention to taxing high-income people.
Raising the stamp duty will be targeted at people and companies that do not pay taxes to the UK, and the extra money will be channelled into government action to ease the plight of the homeless.
The additional fee – which is added to the current stamp tax in addition to the increases in second and investment dwellings added two years ago – can be up to three per cent.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s new buildings are purchased by non-residents in the UK, raising prices and making it more difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the homeowner’s market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK – especially in its capital city – have become ‘ghost cities’ because many foreign real estate owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed cutting the stamp tax as a way to make it easier for young people to buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon affordable housing quotas to remedy Britain’s “disgraceful housing situation.”
Corbyn has released an eye-catching series of proposals to reform the housing market, including restrictions on rents and an end to “involuntary evictions.”
He would also like to give the councils more power in matters relating to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year, I said I was going to dedicate my term as Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream that every generation should have a better life than its predecessors.
This means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, should be able to buy housing as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, owning a home has become a far too distant dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his “ultimate goal” is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about the challenge of lifting back his team from the north-eastern corner of the country. The team is currently in third place in the British 2nd Division.
Ross moved to the "Lights Stadium" this summer after directing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country’s team.
I made it to team two and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“As a child, I often watched Scottish games with my dad at Hampden, and that’s something that has always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will only come to me if I succeed as the manager of the club.”
Ross's predecessors include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about stepping into the boots of his famous predecessors in reputable company. He has previously rejected offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At the moment, I'm measuring my own success by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Based on the structure and capabilities of the club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would probably only consider myself successful if I could get the team back to the Premier League."
Ross has only been a manager for three years, first as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats coaching team.
Afterwards, he helped Allo to emerge from the knockout games of the third series and raised St Mirren from knockout to champions in the following season.
Ross says he feels better than ever in his career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I was probably at the actual crossroads with my career," he recalls the time when he moved to lead Alloa.
“I really thought I was better suited to be a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, made a fair amount of money and enjoyed some relatively large successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player has to do a lot of things every week.
I’m still going through the same things, like stress and work pressure, but leading the team feels like the right job.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now it's my job, and I feel better in my own body than I've ever felt in my adult life."

The summer heatwave has given a kick to British pubs struggling with difficulties, but at the same time it has added to the pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains grew by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, said: “Continuous sunny weather and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July turned into June with 2.8% more pub sales, while the month for restaurants was even worse.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that focused on the drink side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in restaurants sales.
Food-focused pubs also suffer from the heat, but less dramatically than restaurant operators.
It seems that people wanted out just to drink in their minds.
Sales of beverages in pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% over the month, and sales of food products decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman of RSM, a leisure and hospitality consulting firm, says: “The results continue a trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors influencing sales in the off-home dining market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in annual sales is prickling especially now that the industry is currently struggling with cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come to a worse end for food-focused operators, and only time will tell if the milder temperatures in August will bring the respite the industry so desperately needs.
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer that tracks sales in the UK’s pub, bar and restaurant industries, compiling and analysing performance data from a group of 47 industries with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. It is considered a reliable metric in the industry.

One-fifth of children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the existence of fast-growing ‘Instagram fake accounts’, which refers to an Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has heightened fears that the accounts will be able to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they like a cleaned ‘main account’ to be shown to their parents while using other, private accounts.
One mother found messages written by a teenager who hoped to be raped after colliding with her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website.
A study commissioned by Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors’ Council (HMC) found that 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 had two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, says: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to "voice of athletes" in Scottish athletes' government
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletes' Board of Directors to attend the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athlete, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the board, describes the appointment as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the extensive, international-level experience the athlete has accumulated over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected by athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his nomination to the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I look forward to being the speaker of the athletes and I hope I can be of use to help guide Scottish sport in the right direction."
Four Olympic gold medal winners, an American athlete who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and who now serves as the BBC’s permanent commentator, lost their ability to walk as a result of a transient cerebral circulatory disorder.
He tweeted, “A month ago, I had a stroke.”
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time will tell if and in what condition.
This has been exhausting work, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I'm training agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Ads that equate mothers to cows share opinions online
Breast-feeding mothers of a company producing breast pumps have shared opinions on the Internet in a similar ad to dairy cows.
Elvie, a consumer technology company, has launched a product called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump", which is marketed with a tongue-in-cheek advertisement that reflects the style of music videos, describing the new pump's freedom for nursing mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with the following words: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see the tail" and "if you didn't notice, it's not the udder, it's the boobs".
“Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies.”
However, the advertisement on the company’s Facebook page caused a discussion on the internet.
The video, which has gained 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has sparked controversial reactions among viewers. Many say it is making fun of the daily ‘horror’ of the dairy industry.
“Using cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
They have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them shortly after giving birth," one commentator wrote.

Another spectator commented: “Understandably, it’s traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to promote a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
The third commenter added: "A perfect reality-driven ad."
The ad also got defenders: one woman admitted the ad was "funny" to her.
“I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product,” reads one of the comments.
Another spectator commented: “This is a fun ad for mothers who pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and ‘feel like cows.’
The purpose of advertising is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, the women in the video reveal that they have danced discreet pumps feathered in their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and no hoses, and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balari, partner and Artistic Director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is a groundbreaking product that deserved a bold and provocative entry into the market.
Breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump to the forefront, bringing out the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings to life in an entertaining and identifying way.”
The Elvie pump has made headlines before.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk in the costume of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children apprehended has risen sharply, despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration that have made it more difficult to place children in foster families.
Most foster families have traditionally consisted of paperless immigrants, and registering as a foster family can jeopardise their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy would be required to provide their fingerprints, and that this information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs official, testified last week in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster homes for minor migrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
Nearly 80% of people who are either members of foster families or members of their households are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to look for these people," Albence said.
In an effort to deal with cases involving children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that in some cases require the case to be heard in court within one month of detention, instead of the 60-day time limit previously in place, the staff of the reception centre said.
Many people prefer to appear by videoconference rather than in person in their case before the Court of Justice for Migrants.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be expelled as a matter of urgency.
According to reports published by reception centre employees and the system in recent months, the time spent in prison by children affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, the concern is particularly pronounced in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of child desperation may go unnoticed due to the large size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or saying goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupying forces" to leave immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s eighth year of war.
Moualem, who also serves as the prime minister's deputy, said the foreign troops were illegally in the country under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "they will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem claimed that “the war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and since, and where millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the "holy fight until all of Syria is cleared" of both terrorist organizations and "illegal foreign troops".
The United States has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding the Kurds and the Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed a squadron of more than 1,000 troops to the country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were good for the return, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have called on the international community and aid organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They’re politising something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the rebels’ last base in Idlib has created an opportunity for political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on an area of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear time limits" and expressed the wish that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-associated al-Nusra front fighters, "who will be wiped out".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new government and an opposition committee soon to create a post-war draft of the Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem conditioned the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to “revision of the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be elected for second term
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election if, as many liberal spectators likely hope, his presidency was not terminated prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential decision ever!”
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
Since 2014, top-time ratings have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in peak viewing time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show has peaked at 3.5 million viewers on top news nights.
"This is a flare that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC's Designated Survivor program, said of the minister who will become president after the attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine how the Roe vs. Wade case goes, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other, and how the global economy is doing.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duties of a conscious citizen to watch a six-hour panel of experts debating Bob Woodward’s use of source data for Fear, Paul Manafort’s <0x24>15,000 ostrich pilot jacket (according to the Washington Post, “an arrogance blunt garment”), and Stormy Daniels’ unflattering descriptions of President Trump’s anatomy.
I will never be able to watch Super Mario again.
“What he’s doing feels like a reality TV show, because in part it’s about giving something to the audience every night,” says Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Shop series, about the changing characters in Trump’s show and the daily changing plot twists (the NFL dispute, Kim Jong-un’s praise).
You can't miss one episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a lovely sunny day at Far North Coast, but he couldn’t go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not disengage from the program in which Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and it was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money flows from outside for tough midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th constituency has been confronted with a real flow of money, as the reorganisation of the congressional districts will force two already elected candidates to fight in one place.
This newly re-established constituency of Pittsburgh is a battle challenge for Conor Lamb, a democrat who took his place from another constituency in last spring's special elections.
Lamb is competing with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th Constituency of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th Constituency.
The division was reinstated after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituency division was unconstitutional in favour of the Republicans.
Competition in the new 17th constituency has triggered an economic struggle in the main party finance departments of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after the widely watched special elections in the 18th congressional district in March.
The Republican had been there for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won the region by 20%.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a great head start.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew its intentions.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the slight reaction from Washington.
President Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization management team.
U.S. State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama "on the basis of recent policies that Taiwan will no longer be recognized," Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have severely hit a Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity. The similar meeting last year was seen as a step in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to move forward and this effectively ended the speculation about the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give the meeting scheduled for mid-October some sort of signal of the weight the administration gives to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new nasty messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman in Bolton refused to comment on the details of a conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the anonymity clause.
History teaches
The next inevitable step could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which is now very compelling evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to direct an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign was secretly cooperating with Russia when Russia interfered in the US election.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go back to his constituents, and possibly be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of "ifs" here, and I'm not saying that President Trump's defeat would be inevitable - no more than the defeat of similar people in Europe.
We have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those decisions will determine how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, German authorities would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of massacre.
The course of history is turning to such turning points where the inevitable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been charred since it became known that he had proposed a secret recording of the President's speech and considered the President's possible inability to carry out his mission.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
“What will we do if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh’s conduct is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, are we going to vote for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, our democracy will fall into a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, emigrated to America as an immigrant and sent me 60 years later to light the sabbath candles on that table decorated by a swastika.
How could this legacy be anything but optimistic about the future?”

Rangers Graham Dorrans optimistic about Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will meet at home in Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after a draw earlier that month against Villarreal in Spain, a victory over the Austrians would give the team a strong position to reach the G-block of the European League.
Knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from getting on the pitch this season before playing Villarreal 2-2, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal has a good resistance," the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game with the expectation that we could get something and we brought a point with us.
Maybe we could have won at the end, but all in all, a tie is probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
Thursday is another big night in the European League.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a tough game because their result was good in the previous game, but I believe that with the support of this team, we will be able to do everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough when it comes to my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The composition is good and the boys enjoy it; the training goes well.
I hope that we can now push it to its fullest, leave the past season behind and succeed.”
Retirement Saving Fear Takes Women To Sleep At Night
Although the study participants had a clear view of how they hoped to take care of themselves, few had talked about it with their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the nationwide survey said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of national life insurance.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them your wishes in time.
Talk to a professional and your family about where and how to get help, as these questions are an important cost factor.
Get your financial adviser involved in the discussion: advice can also help you figure out a way to cover these costs.
The financing options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or self-financing insurance if you can afford it.
Create legal documents: prevent litigation.
Get a healthcare representative on site so you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals follow your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drawing up a proxy to manage your financial affairs.
It allows you to assign a trusted person to take care of financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your invoices are paid if you cannot take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the little details: imagine that your elderly parent would be on his way to the hospital due to a health emergency.
Can you answer questions about your medication and allergies?
Write this information in the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just about the financial side. Who's his doctor?" Martin asks.
“What medications are used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready.”

The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed to witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in the severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Khul in Indonesia on Friday, and authorities say the number of casualties is expected to increase.
As communications to the area are broken, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the north of the area of the municipality of Donggala, which is closer to the surface centre of the quake of magnitude 7.5.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Key information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
An earthquake and tsunami struck in the middle of the city’s 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala stretches over 300 kilometers (180 miles) northwest of the coastline of the island of Sulawesi.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative area under the province, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the central Sulawesi province, and in particular of the Donggala coastal region, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, several tsunamis have struck in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake in northern Sumatra on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami on December 26 that struck 14 states and killed 226,000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of the victims in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake hit south of the most populated island of Indonesia, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast of the island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 quake hit Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Sumatra Mentawai Islands, causing a ten-metre-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remember the massive damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Lombok tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily isolated thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of a former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report by the Alaskan police on Saturday, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as preventing and resisting a domestic violence report in connection with the arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from a female companion when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Prison and has a <0x24>500 security deposit, KTUU reports.
According to the report, Palin appeared in court on Saturday and replied that he was "definitely innocent".
Palin is charged with three class A offences, which means he can be sentenced to a maximum of one year in prison and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a class B offence, for which he can be sentenced to one day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
At the time, Palin's mother called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently being brought before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence involving possession of a weapon under the influence of a drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder due to service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck Sulawesi island in Indonesia on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications connections are broken and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media from the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for beach festivals in the town of Please when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors consider imposing a rare death penalty on suspect in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that claimed eight lives, a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental car in a October attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, where he ran over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a statement related to the application for the death penalty in New York’s Southern District, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight of his victims and caused “intentionally” serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, it is possible to impose the death penalty on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, which included an indictment for eight murders to assist a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal title in cases related to organized crime. In addition, the charges included charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "significant planning and preparation," prosecutors noted and described the way in which Saipov carried out his actions "terrible, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm, and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement reads.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade has passed since New York’s Southern District Court passed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in New York in a federal case in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed on conviction for conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no signs of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that his actions felt good, police said.
Saipov said he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to a 22-point indictment that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipovi, said the defense was “naturally disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty rather than recognition and life imprisonment without the possibility of release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to those affected," Patton said.
Saipovi’s defence had previously requested that he not be required to face the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable for Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged to mobilize a “civilian army” in a protest against the Conservatives.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested she lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter Bone told the marchers in Birmingham that Britain would be "out by now" if Farage were Brexit secretary.
But May faces a challenge that is underlined by pro-remain conservatives who joined a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on top of the pressure of Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
Supporters demanded that he continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback - and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that she wanted to “throw away the Chequers proposal.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I am in favour of Brexit, but the Chequers proposal needs to be removed."
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not wage world wars to end up in subjugation.
We want to legislate in our own country.”
Bone denounced the idea that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “That the British would have changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely false claim.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers proposal will not be supported by the people, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, nor will it be supported by party members or activists, who really go out into the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers will keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians must feel the pressure if they want to reverse the 2016 referendum.
This is a matter of trust between the people and the political class," he said.
“They are trying to water down Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not accept it.”
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are about to turn around Brexit to feel pressure from you.”
“We will mobilize the army of the people of this country that gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud nation.”
Meanwhile, proponents of staying marched through Birmingham before the two-hour event in the city center.
A small group of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was set up this weekend.
The Labour Party's Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus and smooth border operations for free Irish trade," he added.
“It’s a total farce.
"There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at the City Hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his recurring criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign, in a re-election in November.
Warren is expected to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th town hall meeting with voters after Trump’s season began.
One participant asked if Warren would run for president.
Warren replied that it was "the time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest position."

Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday, said they had arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a member of the LSU basketball team.
Police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man in it.
The Sims, 20, were shot near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being there, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist the arrest and was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
The Sims were a 198-inch junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 startups last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton nears World Championship after team arrangement offers him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas overtook Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’ team arrangements were important in the race.
Bottas got a good start from the pole and left Hamilton almost to himself, defending his position in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the depot first and left Hamilton to drive the team behind him, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went to the depot later in the round and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton passed by after taking some contact and reluctantly shifting the Ferrari driver from the inner line, giving up defending his position after only two third turn moves.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started in the back row and finished seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the race, prolonging the tire change, aiming for a quick end and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikkönen.
He eventually reached the depot in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds with Räikkönen taking fourth place.
This was a tough day because Valtteri did great all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job, achieving a double victory," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein’s allegation that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a testament to people’s “vileness, iniquity and dishonesty.”
“The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate over the past few days, seeing anger, people who are angry, mean, mean and dishonest,” he said.
“When we see publications and leaked things and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you leak the document — ‘oh, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
Did we... No, we didn't leak," he added, sneering at the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford's allegations about Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak was from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes."
But his ban was not good enough for the president, who commented on the matter at Saturday’s event: “I’ll tell you, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual harassment, and believed the accusations were being used by Democrats for their own benefit.
"They are determined to return to power by any means necessary.
You see that meanness and wickedness, they don’t care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars claimed compensation for their loss of the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants on Friday, winning 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead in the early stages, thanks to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the level before Dwyer regained Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard evened Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured victory.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
For the fourth time in a season, the Giants have won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute in 3:35 from Kendall McFaulli's pass, where David Rutherford bait when Beauvillier doubled his lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back to the game in time 13:10 before Matt Marquardt pitched Cownie's handicap goal in time 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead for the first break in the game when he scored his second goal at the end of the first round.
The home team rallied and Bouchard scored again with a head-to-head goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen scored the first lead goal for Dundee at the end of the second round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face the Milton Keynes on Friday.

Although the co-workers fled at risk of their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his workstation at the wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, could safely be launched.
He then jumped out of a control tower he thought was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said Agung’s decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported.
In Balikpapan, Kalimantan, a helicopter was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
I'm afraid he passed away this morning before the helicopter made it to return.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear the number of casualties will rise to thousands because the country's disaster authorities have reported lack of contacts with the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong.
"The number of victims is believed to continue to rise because several bodies are buried in ruins and not many people have been reached," the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo, said in a statement.

Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugin says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
Representatives of an airline that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now say one person is missing, even though earlier reports said all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuki Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people remained in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the aircraft had landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had run over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to wade in a sinking plane in waist-deep water to emergency exits.
He said that the passenger crew was panicking and screaming, and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors at the nearby quay were involved in the rescue work by transporting people to shore on a rubber boat before the plane sank in water about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been associated with the crashes.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed a retrial in which he was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data stored on his cell phone to gather together the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim’s death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was against his earlier claims with Chambers the night he died, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When information showed that Tellis's cell phone was at Chambers's while Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, Sanford was questioned by the police.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was "lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
According to the data recorded on their cell phones, they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after Chambers’ death, Tellis removed Chambers’ text messages, phone calls, and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The final defence speeches are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by making music full of positive messages.
According to Bristol-based band The High Breed, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages related to politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed the rise of the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
New York babysitter sues couple for racist text message
A New York-based nanny sues the couple for discriminatory dismissal after accidentally receiving a text message from the child’s mother complaining that she is “again black.”
The couple denies being racist and equates the challenge with “extortion.”
Lynnsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when a new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived at work on her first day of work in 2016 and she realized that she was black.
"EIIIIIIII, AGAIN DARK," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Then she sent a message to Giselle Maurice instead of her husband, twice.
Realizing the mistake he had made, Plasco-Flaxman had fired Maurice, according to the New York Post, announcing that his former African-American nanny had done her job poorly and this time she was expecting a Filipino.
Maurice was paid for one day of work and was sent home by taxi.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for dismissal and wants <0x24>350 a day for the six-month period for which he was originally hired to live and work in the family, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to racist allegations by saying that ending Maurice’s employment was a justified decision because they could not trust him after insulting him.
"My wife sent him things he wasn't supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco said in an interview with Posti.
"But would you leave your child to someone you've been unkind to, even by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco equated the challenge with blackmail and said his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was in “a very difficult situation.”
"Are we going to start chasing someone else in this situation?
It's not very nicely done," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, shattering their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared the audience would not identify with the talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s approval, says of the letter: “It’s hard to live in the position of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
Noting that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before dedicating himself to writing children's books about toy bear adventures, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books seemed bittersweet because his father died the year before.
He described Paddington as "a very important family member" and noted that his father was silently proud of the success it had achieved.
"He was quite a quiet man, and not at all a bragging type," the daughter said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; something you are proud of, though not really your own.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
Her daughter had been rushed after the plane landed at the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"They kept calling and telling me that the situation was really bad, that he wasn't expected to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called and said that my daughter was going to die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The medications that kept his heart running gradually vanished from his body.
He had died a little earlier, and now it's all gone.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to hold myself together.”
Eventually, mourning the loss of his daughter, Ednan-Laperouse boarded a plane with other passengers — who knew nothing of the ordeal she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
“I kept my head down and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a tremendous amount of sympathy for Nadia.
That he needed my love and understanding now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.”
Dying Women Send Cards to Prevent Suicide at Bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number to get support.
Davis’s son Tyler developed depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis, who lives in Lydney, 45, says his son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile illuminated the whole room.”
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt he was in “darkness.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother, who had taken his own life.
Davis says he's always afraid of the aftermath.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go to to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent - you have to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years, and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was depressed or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was down on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact or anything like that."
Mark’s death was a traumatic experience for them, but they still have to survive: “It breaks up the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But all we have to do is move on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as FBI opens investigation
"I thought that if we could really get what he wanted -- a limited investigation in terms of time and scope -- maybe we could get some coherence," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "disintegrate" into the deadlock caused by the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Reluctance is about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republican success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country’s highest court will be made more difficult.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called senators to lobby to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush’s time, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes, in which case Vice President Mike Pence could blow out the game and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors drops during Kim
The South Korean legislature said the number of people who migrated to South Korea from North Korea had declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Unification as saying that there were 1,127 defects last year, with 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, the key factors have been tightening border controls between North Korea and China, as well as raising the prices of human smugglers.
There has been no public comment on Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korean defectors will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often forcibly returns them.
Technically speaking, relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders met in Pyongyang and the talks focused on stagnant talks on the dismantling of nuclear arms.
This followed the June historic meeting at which U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed in general terms on the pursuit of nuclear neutrality on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for stalling the sanctions after the meeting.
"Without any trust from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis and under such circumstances, we will under no circumstances begin to unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and unfit to serve in Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I couldn't help but think that if she had behaved like this, she would be called a 'hysterical'," Pelosi said in a statement about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was emotionally involved, and at times he almost screamed and lost his ability to speak as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the committee’s Democratic members without calling the allegations against himself “a grotesque and planned persecution of a person” organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was incapable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased toward the Democrats.
"I think he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," Pelosi said.
Pelosi wondered, when asked if he would file an indictment against Kavanaugh, if his election were confirmed, and if the Democrats could get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“Let’s just say that if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he won’t be qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he currently works,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently works for the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible orders regarding the health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case, as Kavanaugh is known as a conservative justice practitioner.
During the hearings related to his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected to the court and we are expected to say that it is wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women have to survive everything.
It is a legitimate fire speech with months and years of rage, and he cannot keep it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
He continued: “I was helped tremendously by a woman who was in a leadership position somewhere, who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a way of saying to her interlocutor in a situation where she was angry and started crying: ‘You might think I’m sad now because I’m crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are justified as a pathway of rage, although they are usually misunderstood fundamentally.
One of the most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is when I once cried speechlessly out of rage and an older woman — a cold-tempered supervisor I had always been a little afraid of — grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and then they’re happy because they made you feel sad.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage relationship on a boat called Monkey Business in 1987 and was forced out of the race, Schroeder was extremely frustrated and felt there was no reason why he should not run for president himself.
"It wasn't a very well-thought-out decision," he told me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates, and one more was least needed.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow and the Seven Dwarfs.’”
Because the campaign was long overdue, he was behind the fundraiser, and so he announced he wouldn’t go to the race unless he could get <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
It became clear to him that some of his supporters, who gave the male nominees <0x24>1,000, gave him only <0x24>250.
“Do you think I’m going to get a discount?” he thought.
When he delivered his speech and announced that he would not launch an official campaign, he was overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude for his supporters, frustration at a system that made it so difficult to raise funds for electoral work against voters rather than delegates, and hatred for sexism that he could not speak.
"You could have thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the reaction of the press.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my gravestone would be cut into a commemorative inscription.
“He was crying.”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The start of the U.S.-China trade war was a narrative, and while the battle is far from over, the break-up between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China’s most important exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting imported goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all Chinese imports into the United States.
Beijing has responded every time, most recently by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US <0x24>60 billion worth of imported goods.
China has promised to respond to the United States in an eye-to-eye fashion, and it does not appear that the world’s second-largest economic power is falling for a moment.
In order to get Washington to back down, we would have to give in to our own demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts note that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the U.S. trade war could have a positive long-term impact on China by reducing interdependence between the two countries.
“A short political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start an economic downturn in either country, and this is actually a more dangerous possibility than bystanders have realized so far,” said Abigail Grace, a research assistant at the Center for New American Security.
Syrian Foreign Minister Says 'Ready' to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal situation.
The conditions now allow refugees to voluntarily return to the country they were forced to leave as a result of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for helping to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
Team Europe confirms Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the United States with 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team retained the crown when its Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team scored 14.5 points to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson faced difficulties almost throughout the tournament and hit his starting shot in the water at par-3 on hole 16, giving the match to Francesco Molinar.
Italian Molinari glittered in all rounds and became one of the four players who have scored 5-0-0 since the tournaments began in their current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America was out 5&4 against Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player in the European team.
Dustin Johnson lost with 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European ever, with a total of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to win this victory.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to be able to help,” said Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a after the European team’s victory.
He hands the torch over to his compatriot Jon Rahm, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the individual races played on Sunday.
"I feel immense pride after defeating Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now holds the Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Weird statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big wins and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find paths throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after the failed performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We pushed the European team in this morning's games.
We fought back.
Glory to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We regroup, I work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we move on.
These 12 guys are awesome, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to put my hat on.
We met our winners.”
Situation of Red Tide algal blooms: concentrations drop in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there is a general decline in algae numbers in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more dispersed algae areas are reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating a possible decrease in concentrations.
Red tide algae blooms along the coast for a distance of about 130 miles from Pinellas to the southern districts of Lee.
Ferries can be observed ten miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer of them than last week.
Red tide blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the coast of Pinellas County last week, ranging from low to high on the coasts of Hillsborough County, from background to high in Manatee and Sarasota County, from background to moderate in Charlotte County, and from background to high in Lee District and Collier County.
Respiratory symptoms are still reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier regions.
Over the past week, there have been no reports of respiratory symptoms in northwest Florida.
