Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane to home win in opening - Savo Volley wins second
Hurrikan-Loimaa, who had won the Men’s Volleyball Championship medals seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raisio Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most powerful player in the Hurricane with 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they didn’t happen, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
We were able to get things done pretty quickly, Kouki said.
Tomi Rumpunen, who also played in Loimu, supported Kouk with 18 points.
Samuli Kaislasalo was the most efficient player of the team with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many of the players had experience on the other side, and that brought extra extras to the game.
Our game isn’t finished yet, but of course continuing the medal line is the goal,” Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley 's
Miro Määttänen was Savo Volley's most powerful with 18 points, when the team defeated the Ducks 3-0 in Vieremä.
Our game was volatile, especially in the attacking end, but fortunately we managed to squeeze the victory.
At least I didn’t have any conscious different download when I played against my former team,” Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 2000-01 season in Vieremä Volleyball, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere was on the ceiling all the time.
Good feeling from home opening.
Miro was the king, Sillikin played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Sammo in Pielavesi, while Tuovinen was still the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most powerful of the Ducks with 14 points.
Mikkonen again Akaa-Volley's star
Joni Mikkonen, who won the 2012-13 league point exchange, has also started this season strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his opening win after defeating the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started well for itself.
Today was almost a loss, because we were 17-21 in the fourth round.
We had a win in the round, and the fifth round came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the Tigers' most powerful was the 28-point hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Landlord Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs won by 17 points.
We didn’t get much of a grip on the guy’s hacker, Mikkonen praised.
Finland ranks No. 1 in the world in human capital comparison
Finland is the world leader in the comparison of human capital, says the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the number one country in statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands ranked higher than Canada, and Taiwan was found on the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst in comparison.
Human capital measures the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has outlined that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois keeps Atletico in check, local game finishes goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois swung into a grandstand, and the Madrid teams’ local match ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but the Belgian guard Courtois managed to repel.
Courtois played three seasons for Atletico when he was a Chelsea player.
At the beginning of the week, the FIFA International Football Federation selected him as goalkeeper of the year.
Gareth Bale scored the best goal in Real, but his shot passed the goal at the end of the opening half.
After the break, Bale was switched because of a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, the disillusioned supporters of Real shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, a painter who had moved to Juventus.
In the United States, the right to abortion is now under attack – a powerful documentary explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate nominated by President Donald Trump, could be elected as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
Many in the Republican Party hope that Kavanaugh’s decisive vote will overturn the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - The United States and Abortion Rights tells how the current situation has evolved over the years.
As unbelievable as it may seem, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received various levels of support from the majority of our country’s parliamentarians.
Colleen McNicholas, a gynaecologist, is the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri.
An armed guard at the clinic said he was defending U.S. religious freedom.
The news clips remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
It was a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, a consortium of Lutheran clergymen guided women to reliable abortion surgeons.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but actually they are not even needed, a photo of the woman who died after an abortion.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States every year.
The legalization of abortion was supported by the Republican Party.
In 1967, California's Abortion Rights Act was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan who, in his presidential campaign in 1980, began to confuse religion with politics to lure voters.
Abortion was also the result of his successor, George Bush the Elder.
And so did Donald Trump.
The documentary reaches the bottom of the issue in its search for the underlying reason for the politicization of the abortion issue.
By denying tax exemption to racially segregated religious organizations, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen.
Religion has brought extraordinary nodes to politics.
At the time of writing this, there is a situation in the United States where the president, boasting of his sexual harassment but catching the voices of the religious right with his position on abortion, has elected Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, who is now accused by several women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh will have the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children, at border protests
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in the past six months after Israel fired on demonstrators in the border area.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border area on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the dead: 12- and 14-year-old boys.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and launched an air strike on the border when demonstrators threw rocks and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says it has started using force to prevent demonstrators from breaking down the border fence or aiming for the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in protests in Gaza since March, when Palestinians began weekly protests at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12,000 people are injured.
The protesters demanded that Palestinian families enter the areas from which the Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
He got a penalty kick - he couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's topman Chey Dunkley seemed to overthrow him with a rear-facing tackle in the penalty area.
Judge Gavin Ward let the game continue.
According to his interpretation, the strike was clean.
Santa couldn’t believe his eyes.
I think the situation was left with referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed a penalty point, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 win.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the championship.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with a chest muscle.
It tasted like Santa again.
When he lost the ball, he continued until the end.
He created goals and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, it was the fifth match in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There's a pipe of five wins in the back.
The pedophile assistance service was immediately filled with reservations - about 40,000 people in Finland are experiencing interest in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-teenagers.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
For those who are sexually interested in children or young people, it has been difficult to get help so far.
The SeriE project, a joint project between the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals in encountering paedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, a flood of e-mails started in Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, and the appointments were booked very quickly, Yle says.
These are expected to be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a cause of shame for many.
The majority of those who perceive pedophile feelings in themselves have not fulfilled their fantasies and thus done nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and depress them.
They also complicate normal life, says Yle’s sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if even one child is spared from sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
US President Donald Trump as a Nobel Peace Prize winner – the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites for the prize, according to betting odds.
The background is Trump’s role in getting North Korea to commit to nuclear disarmament, at least at the level of speech.
The two biggest winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and pledged to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the Koreas is significant, as last year the relations were still frosty.
Yet rewarding Kim, who has been threatening his country with nuclear weapons for years with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Prizes will be announced on Monday, and Friday will be the most notable, the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to diplomats from the Korean peninsula, one of the top candidates is Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
Respected gynecologists have treated thousands of women in their hospitals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) who have been the victims of mass rapes and have become the world’s leading expert in their field.
Mukwege’s work has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a gruesome by-product of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that this year it will receive 331 nominees.
The names of the candidates will not be published.
Trump wouldn’t mind getting a Nobel Prize.
In May, a journalist asked him in the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
"Everyone thinks so, but I would never say so," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
“The award I want is a win for the whole world,” the president said, referring to the North Korean talks.
However, there are some things that make Trump’s Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often acknowledged individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and a multipolar world order – exactly the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three U.S. politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
Rewarding Trump would require a ideological reversal by the Nobel Committee.
A fire in a tunnel: Drivers behaved like slingshots and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on Route 1 in Lohja occurred on September 8.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off both towards Turku and Helsinki.
When it was discovered that there was a system failure, the fire department tried to bring traffic back to normal.
However, this did not happen very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it cannot be opened, because there are motorists on the road and they are driving any way it hurts, Pasi Kääriäinen, a firefighter on duty, told STT at the time.
At the time, the highway was even driven in the wrong direction after just a moment’s wait.
When the first starts to act against traffic rules, a few others are often followed by Tapio Heiskanen, the Liaison Manager of Traffic Safety.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop for any other reason than for compelling reasons.
Traffic safety reminds us that in exceptional situations one cannot risk traffic with hastily implemented solutions.
Emergency vehicles shall always be provided with the most accessible passage possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially prohibited, as is making a u-turn and reversing.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels, where in addition the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also prohibited, as is parking, of course.
Recently, there have even been cases where a driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for the activity in question, Heiskanen says in a statement from Liikenneturva.
The lynx fans would have liked to continue their celebration even though the ship was caught at the bottom of the lake
The Ilves fans transported by the inland waterway ship M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on the ship to continue their victory celebration, even if the ship had been caught by its bow at the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the captain of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, which was on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, got off its route late on Saturday evening and caught up with its bow at the bottom in Vanajavesi, Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one got hurt in the dude.
The fans of Ilves would have liked to continue their celebrations on the ship until the morning, but of course it was more reasonable to send them to the port by the fire department and by bus home,” Syrjä told STT.
The fans of Ilves had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 win by Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday’s frolic was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also complicated by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered with logs, which is why its reflectors could not normally be seen on a dark autumn bridge.
No more noteworthy collision
Haveri took place on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalmi, shortly after the ferry route had crossed the bridge of the motorway between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama involved in the incident, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and hitting the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to Syrjä, catching the bottom has not caused any leaks or pressings on the ship, and the cruises on the ship will continue as usual.
The diver went to check the condition of the ship on Saturday morning before the ship was towed off the shallows.
We will go to the shipyard to make sure that no damage has been caused,” Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that the next cruise to M/S Tampere, booked for next weekend, can be arranged as agreed.
The cruise will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue service received an alert on Saturday night shortly after 1:30 p.m.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
On-call fire chief Matti Willman told me late in the evening that the conditions for evacuation on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and rather strong winds.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced on Sunday night after 3:30 p.m. that all the passengers on board have been evacuated and the passengers have been transferred to Tampere by bus.
The cruiser, built in 1957, was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump Justice Candidate Accused of Harassment and Drinking May Be Left Out of Top Position
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as a judge at the U.S. Supreme Court, may well miss the post he is seeking, says Mika Aaltola, Program Director at the Institute of Foreign Policy.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during her studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up playing someone else.
Occasionally, in the United States, there has been a lot of controversy over the presidential candidate for the Supreme Court.
In this case, the nominee for the judge has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
In this way, the president has been able to keep his face.
The nomination would fall on Democrats
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but in the case of Kavanaugh at least, the election of a new judge has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will likely fall into the hands of the Democratic Party in the upcoming mid-term elections.
It would raise the voter turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
Not every term of office is an opportunity to be appointed, as judges of the Supreme Court are appointed for life in the United States.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at about the age of 70-80.
Some Republicans have doubts about the name.
The U.S. Supreme Court judges will normally be screened, Aaltola says.
Even though Trump has only set a one-week deadline for the FBI’s further investigation, it can still bring out something essential, Aaltola said.
Yes, it might.
Rarely is there smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, it is at least certain that Kavanaugh’s suitability or ineligibility for the post will still be discussed vigorously before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are believed to be suspicious of Kavanaugh’s appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the nomination would be put to a vote and the Republicans would lose.
Woman Identifies Salisbury Suspect as Military Intelligence Agent
A Russian woman told the BBC she identified a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of Russian military intelligence.
The woman said it was Anatoly Tshepi, a military intelligence officer at the GRU.
Bellingcat and Insider Russia said they had previously revealed one of the men suspected of poisoning as Chepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men’s current identities were covert identities.
The BBC team travelled to a village near the Russian-Chinese border in the Far East, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognized a young Chepiga from photos published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man in photographs of the British police who depicted a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshiro.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Chepiga has been awarded the Russian Hero's Badge in 2014.
Russia still denies the GRU connection.
The men said in an interview with Russian television in September that they had been in Salisbury as tourists.
Elderly people in health and social care reform
Now we have a living example of what the change limit for health and social services reform, defined by the Government of Sipilä, means in practice.
The health and social services of my birth municipality, Vaala, are provided by Oulunkaari Municipality Consortium, whose health service director was elected in 2016 by Attendo’s former regional director.
Leaders of the municipal association warn the council about the change limiter.
If health and social services expenditure rises now, the municipality’s state aid will be cut in the future.
The city’s central decision-makers were alarmed, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring in the care of the elderly, which would put an end to institutional care in the hospital ward of the health centre and a small unit for people with memory disorders.
Home care would be increased, which means that the elderly living in remote villages in Vaala will be torn from their roots to be treated "at home" next to the health centre.
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay it customers.
The Whale Left did not swallow the poor preparation, but organised a good public event, which attracted a large number of relatives, close caregivers and also delegates from other parties.
I presented with the slides of the Health and Social Welfare Convention how the municipality of Vaala already treats the elderly the most at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, the delegate of the neighbouring municipality, was also present.
The local newspaper made a big story about the occasion, and it once again lifted the Oulunkaari draftsmen on their backs.
The social workers do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for the residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only talk about service vouchers, but they do not say what level of care they will provide or what staff structure Attendo will use to care for the elderly up to hospice care.
Without a nurse?
The health centre will be closed down because there is no doctor’s night stand.
Attendo will also resort to the doctors of the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the whale shows how central officials run delegates with incomplete information and delegates put their backs against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party empties the inhabitants of Vaala, because who will stay there unsafe to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was there a single electoral slogan in the center that the whole country would be kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan Opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
Thousands of people protested in Cologne, Germany, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine River since the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, he read on the signs of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During Erdogan’s visit, which began on Thursday, several protests took place and security measures were tight.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected on the streets in advance to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
There were also supporters of Erdogan in the vicinity of the Great Mosque.
However, police had isolated a large area of the mosque from its surroundings for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised his visit to Germany as a success and said it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep differences between the two countries, among other things, on human rights issues.
Criticism surrounds the visit
Both Henriette Reker, Mayor of Cologne, and Armin Laschet, Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, withdrew from the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan’s visit escalated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he had come from Switzerland to protest against Erdogan.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go on the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final phase of Erdogan’s trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish descent.
Three accused in Slovakia of murdering journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor said three people were charged with the February murder of Kuciak and his fiancée, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot dead in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police suspect the murders were linked to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of cattle on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to the printing defect, the Sunday Karjalainen will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This can be seen in magazine distribution in sparsely populated areas, where distribution to common boxes has to be done from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's newspaper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The mail will put extra bouquets of newspapers in the province.
The newsletters of other Finnish subscribers will not be mailed separately until Monday.
The distribution of these newspapers is considerably delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg will be interviewing Vesa Heilala, among others, live in his upcoming discussion programme today.
Vesa is in the studio to tell about her upcoming space journey, which she booked for Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151,000, which required a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year after year.
It now seems that after the unfortunate test flight that took place in 2014 and claimed a fatality, things are in order.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start later this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa’s flight number is 300, which means that his journey takes place about a year from the first departure.
The flight will take 2.5 hours and be in a weightless state for 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 km, the Finnish astronaut says on his website.
At the same address, he also expresses his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book magazine called Space Journey and saw Star Trek on TV.
I've seen the Star Wars and that's what made the idea...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a great host.
Manchester City continued their defeatless run in the Premier League after defeating Brighton 2–0 at home on Saturday.
The sixth win of the season was guaranteed by Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth goal of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute at the Brighton goal post.
Agüero raised his own score to five when he and Sterling sawed the Brighton defense into pieces in the 65th minute of the game.
The Argentinean was able to rank 2-0 at the penalty point with ease.
With six wins and one draw, City leads the Premier League with a catch of 19 points.
Liverpool, who played one game less, is only one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their seventh round match on Saturday night.
Youth clubs choose new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting, which ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Association chose new decision-makers for its next three-year term in 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected as Chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme as Vice Chairman.
40 ordinary members and 40 deputy members were elected to the council, the Finnish Youth Association announces on Sunday.
Youth meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Council in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year operational goals: We will keep the doors open for everyone, and we will organise equal recreational activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we will support volunteering and people on their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Association says in a statement.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkönen and surprised Ferrari: "Losing a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, Mercedes was asked if he believed that releasing Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's service would help Hamilton for the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari’s second driver Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
Just under three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen would not be in the team next season and Räikkönen announced that he would be moving to Sauber.
Hamilton does not believe that Raikkonen is going to throw gloves at the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He will remain one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his foreskins.
I don’t know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
"I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday with a Russian race.
Valtteri Bottas from Mercedes starts the race from the pole position at 2 p.m.
The evening newspaper follows the race moment by moment.
Football A-jugenders’ Finnish Championship became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top division for boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
The starting points were clear from the point of view of the championship fight that started before 1 p.m.: one point against Vasa IFK is enough for FC Lahti Academy.
In order to reverse the situation in the final round, Ilves, who is second in the championship fight, must win PK-35 and wish the Lahti people to lose.
However, the Lahti championship was confirmed in practice even before the starting whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less player, the game would not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
On a break, the Lahti leaders led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players in Vaasa is that the team has played with the same players in the A-juvenile SM-series, i.e. the P20-series, and the men’s Kakkonen C-block.
Vasa IFK has played in Kakkonen practically against the fall of the whole season.
In the final round of Kakkonen on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win the JBK away game and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own away game against KuFu in Toivala in Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno - the rescue department said luck was involved
The passenger car drove off the road and ended up on its roof at Eno at 9 a.m. on Sunday.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were injured, the rescue department said.
It was good luck, the statement said.
Rescue department said the road was wet after the rain.
A police patrol went to the crash site.
Supo expects new ways of inquiring: Equipment acquisitions and recruitments have already been made, there will be no delays in planning operations abroad
According to Antti Pelttar, Head of Supo, the Intelligence Act has been prepared for by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
With the entry into force of the Intelligence Acts, there would be a permanent increase of about ten million euros in the budget of the suppo.
The premises of the protection police (supo) located on Ratakatu in Helsinki are already fully preparing for the entry into force of the Intelligence Acts.
Antti Pelttari, the head of Supo’s co-operative party, tells Lännen Media that equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is shocked by a video where she sings topless – campaigning for awareness of breast cancer
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is back.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account in which she sings only with her hands in front of her breasts, according to AFP news agency.
I Touch Myself is a 1991 Australian song by The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I voted for The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to do regular self-examinations," Williams wrote in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in the area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is the a and o of everything - it scares the lives of many.
The Divinyls song was co-authored by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, created in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams said.
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams retired from the tennis tournament in Beijing earlier this week.
There was a riot in the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams fired at the match’s referee, claiming, among other things, that men’s behavior would be much harsher than that of women’s players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain trail is not suitable for altitude lovers
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant offers stunning scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in Zhejiang Province, China.
It is literally located on a cliff.
If you want, you can look at the forest below.
The rugged landscapes at high altitude make restaurant visitors breathe in the Longquan Mountains.
Access to the restaurant requires hiking in the middle of peach trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers on 19.9.2018.
Youtube commenters wonder where the restaurant toilet is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the place is told.
This is the end of the race today: this is how it all ends.
All good things will end in time.
Today it happens to the Finnish country drama Korpela alley run, which has been quite liked.
The third season has gone on like a hot rock: last week, 722 000 Finns watched the episode on TV for the first time.
The peak figures as such no longer have any practical significance, as there will be no continuation of the series by Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen.
In the final episode, the relationship between Jaska and Mirku is taking another big leap forward, and I think Jaska’s mother is the first to guess what’s coming.
The relationship between Anssi and Miisa is also warm, in the light of recent events quite romantic, but then Laiho appears again.
Even the police are suspicious of the man.
Still, no one can predict Laiho's fate in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets some incredible news.
The last will of the distance is revealed, which brings a woman to the brink of tears.
After a week on Sunday evenings, Sorjonen continues with new episodes.
Korpela lane race today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Should I go to work tomorrow with a cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of people decide whether to stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether it is worth going to infect others, as the disease can be contagious, even if the symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu strike suddenly, sometimes they appear with creeps.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms seem small, according to the journal Prevention.
Is it worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted the day before the symptoms start and then from five days to a week.
Children can infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough stops and the fever is gone, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Exercise should also be avoided.
Returning to the gym too quickly slows down recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, swipe into a handkerchief, and throw the rags into the trash.
Sick of moving, though?
If you have to leave the house sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not contain viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
You can't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
The sneezing is also limited to the mask.
How can we avoid infection?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
The latter, however, is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats Missi tradition: "My husband is an ice hockey player"
The hockey player and the missi are often associated with each other.
This was the case with Alina Voronkova, 23 years old.
Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa has won the Miss Finland crown for her dogs in 2018.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina’s mother is Ingrian Finnish and her father Russian.
Father's Russianness Voronkova was bullied at school.
My mom and dad moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianness.
I didn’t have any friends in Pertunmaa,” says Alina at the semi-finalist launch of the Miss Suomi competition.
After high school, Alina decided to start clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the lady found new friends and the day started to roll as desired.
When I was 15 years old, I thought I was an adult, but I wasn’t.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar from the Pelicans.
Since his career in the SM-liiga, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he played for the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Championships.
At the beginning of the relationship, the couple lived in a distant relationship for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning trio and have a career with it, I don’t want to believe that it will affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live separately, trust works well for us and the good thing about the distance relationship is that the initial spark stays on all the time, Alina grinned in May.
Continuous growth with joy, death behind us
Almost everyone is concerned about the Earth’s resilience.
Yet, we don’t want to give up anything.
Sustainable alternatives to continued growth are being sought, but even the theory of moderation runs into major problems.
Over the course of a few generations, the steady growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that they could only dream of before.
However, the long-standing exceedance of the earth’s carrying capacity and climate change are causing this market economy’s footsteps to destabilise threateningly.
Two men were stabbed in Kannelmäki on the Sitratori at 4 a.m. on Sunday night.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stab wound, and another, born in 1968, was less severely injured.
The older men have already been discharged from the hospital.
Police have arrested one person whose possible involvement in the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect in the incident.
The incidents are being investigated as attempted murder and aggravated assault.
IFK Mariehamn's important point - Inter's coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's handicap against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the match in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through from the right side and luckily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
In the guest sabre game, the Mariehamns reached the two points of the Turku Ball Association.
An important goal and a valuable point, summarized Mariehamn’s head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg noted that the team did not get caught up in the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily the Turku goal brought us more into the game.
John Allen, the head coach of Inter, said the game was under control, but it was painful to score again.
"One defense mistake took us a full point," Allen said.
We were the best again!
Finland has the most human value in the world
Finland ranked first in the comparison of 195 countries.
The study measured the health and education of the people.
Finland is the best country in the world when measured by human capital.
Finland was ranked 1st in a survey that measured citizens’ health, education and learning.

Lehterä showed his underpowered skills, the place of play is not yet certain
Jori Lehteränen’s strong underpower play emerged as his NHL Philadelphia Flyers played their last rehearsal match before the season began.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehterä fed Michael Raffl twice to score.
In the last few days, the magazine has been on display due to drug suspicions.
MTV said on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug swarm where some are suspected of using drugs and some of them are suspected of selling, for example.
He has denied having committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the issue, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Sam Carchidi, a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, who closely follows the Flyers, estimates that Lehterä is a member of the group of six attackers, five of whom will take a seat on the NHL team.
In the training match, Lehtera was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second round, Lehtereä fought the puck for himself with underpowering, pulled the defender and fed Raffl, who was waiting for the goal, to the open position.
For the second time, the duo’s cooperation scored a goal right at the end of the match.
The Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4 with an away game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team’s coaching team to decide if he can join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of it.
Now the coach decides if I can play.
"I think I'm ready for the NHL," Waakanainen said in an interview posted on Boston's Twitter account.
Waagelainen played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
At the Boston goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rejected 20 times.
Flies-back defender Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit when the team defeated Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary's ranks, Ilves was raised by defender Juuso Välimäki, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
Oilers rested on Jesse Puljujärv and goalkeeper Mikko Koski.
Aleksander Barkov played 20 minutes and scored in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara fed his team a consolation goal in the semifinal when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the goal of the losers, Joonas Korpisalo rejected 23/27 puck.
Already more than 180,000 responses to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to the survey concerning the decision on the future of Finland.
The question of whether Finland should apply winter or summer time permanently in the future has already gathered more than 180,000 responses.
The survey opened in the Otakantaa.fi service can still be answered in less than a couple of weeks.
Respondents are also asked whether Finland should be at the same time as other Nordic, Baltic, Central European or Western Russia countries.
World's Strongest Man Lost Tens of Pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world, undergoes a striking transformation.
Eddie Hall has been the world’s strongest man for a long time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories a day and weighed up to 200 kilos, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were in size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body was not created to be this size, Hall said.
The British sought the victory of the world’s strongest man in every way possible, and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want her children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was never seen again at the 2018 World's Strongest Man competition in April.
Recently, Hall posted on Instagram a picture of her posing in a much slimmer shape than her active career.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 kilograms.
Hall wrote that he currently exercises aerobically five times a week.
The program includes activities such as boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week in the gym.
This year, Icelander Haf<0xC3><0xBE><0xC3><0xB3>r J<0xC3><0xBA>l<0xC3><0xAD>us Björnsson, familiar from the TV series Game of Thrones, became the strongest man in the world.
The previous Finnish winner is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed on the ground in Pyhäjärvi - "Fixed on a rock"
The inland waterway ship M/S Tampere landed late on Friday evening in Pyhäjärvi in Akala.
The rescue service received an alarm from a water traffic accident on Friday night after 2:30 p.m.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has drifted onto a cliff and is firmly attached to its forehead on a rock, described on-call fire chief Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the Rescue Department, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being transported by bus to Tampere, Jari Nieminen, the on-call manager, told STT after one o’clock at night.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had somehow drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
Police are investigating the cause of the incident.
On-call fire chief Matti Willman said earlier this evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to the darkness and rather strong winds.
The rescue department said the ship's fate was unclear.
Apparently the ship isn't leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers will begin to check the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now an inland waterway vessel serving as a restaurant vessel with a maximum passenger capacity of 180 persons.
There is also a private meeting room on board.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
The fight of Robert Helenius against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a financial dispute.
Today, Ilta-Sanomat reported on a challenge filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and LL.J. Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius is charged over 80,000 euros of unpaid manager’s fees with default interest.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15 April 2014-30 January 2015.
We've tried to compromise, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear assignment here, and a lot of work has been done,” Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanom.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent a response to Iltalehti, explaining the boxer’s view of the events.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the amount claimed.
According to the answer, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a difficult financial situation and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It had been agreed verbally that Helenius would be obliged to pay only a percentage of his matches.
It was repeatedly asserted that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they had arranged.
This is also the standard and only practice for professional athletes.
Salary work has never been agreed upon, and it would have been absurd in Helenius’ situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement.
Helenius would have liked to agree on the income distribution in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not get the draft until the end of 2014.
He found the proposal poor and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not deal with Kokkila and Helminen once.
One year after the end of the collaboration, Helenius had been assigned an "unidentifiable but substantial" invoice for the manager's work.
This year, the same allegations have been made.
Helenius considers Helminen’s and Kokkila’s post-production activities to be cowardly.
Helenius today faces Erkan Teper, the seventh in the IBF heavyweight competition in Stuttgart.
A heartfelt man and a good reporter
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Erkki Pälli, a long-time radio presenter and journalist, died at the age of 83 of incurable liver cancer.
The report of the host’s death was published in Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday.
The report states that Pälli died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the information about the fate of the acquaintance.
He had already said goodbye on Facebook, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli to be a multi-talented expert who became an excellent journalist.
He recalls that Pälli was a well-liked person with quick brainstorms and funny things.
I got to know Erkki when I was a little boy when I first visited Finnlevy when I was 12 years old and started there as a warehouse man.
We met with Erik then.
At the time, he was a spokesperson for Finnlevy and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I moved on to record as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions when Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all festivals doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I could see how much fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly into the skin of the interviewees.
He was a good man and a good reporter.
For many, he became known as a respected Yle radio host, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper articles.
Erik interviewed me several times.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked not only as a journalist but also with Toivo Kärje at the Fazer record company.
He worked as a music producer on the recordings of Vesa-Matti Loir.
His greatest passion, however, was radio work, where he had an original style.
He was a radio worker from the 1960s onwards, and he became known to numerous listeners in Yle’s ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The union describes its economic situation as having experienced a "full turnaround", although the economy is certainly burdened by "significant debt in the balance sheet".
CEO Mika Kulmala praises the rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning and financial management of our operations has taken place throughout our organisation, Kulmala says in a press release.
We have also been very successful in partner acquisition and in addition, the profits from the World Cups were maximum in the past competitive season.
However, also in the future, the management of costs must be precise, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies are lying in the backyard of the hospital in the town of Please on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where the injured survivors are gathered to assess the injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors due to aftershocks.
One of the people in the hospital area was the 52-year-old Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
In the yard of an army hospital, Dwi Haris was lying down, injured in his back and arm.
When the earthquake began, he was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to the wedding party.
I was probably squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe, Haris told AP, according to British media.
Small shops are robbed
Please, at the evacuation center, Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of a small baby, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many Please residents have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house were somehow upright, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the inhabitants under it.
According to the news agency AP, more than half of the inmates in Kira’s prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were about 560 inmates, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Some of the detainees in Donggala prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became furious and set the prison on fire after guards told them not to go looking for their relatives who had been affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Please, the airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land on the field was an army C-130 transport plane, which brought aid supplies.
Commercial flights Please enter the airport only to a limited extent.
Pilots are forced to land without the help of air traffic control, as the tower was severely damaged by the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long rainfall area will spread across the country on Sunday night, according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Rain comes mostly in the form of water, but in central and northern Lapland, sleet or snow is expected.
The frosts of the previous night are not recurring, because under the cloud cover the temperatures remain higher.
A cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures fairly well under control.
You can visit the frost side in the west for a while,” said on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainfall will recede eastwards during the morning.
In the south and west it is cloudy or cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to the height of Oulu between 10 and 13 degrees.
The starting week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather is becoming more unstable.
Sea areas have wind and wave warnings.
No actual autumn storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be typical autumn weather.
This autumn is starting to get really serious, Ilkka said.
Miss Suomi final not on TV
On IL-TV, you can watch the glamour and sparkle of the Miss Finland Red Carpet competition.
Iltalehti’s entertainment journalists are broadcasting live on IL-TV from the Red Carpet of the Miss Suomi Final from Billnäs Ruukki.
The broadcast starts at around 6.50 p.m.
New Miss Finland will be crowned from 10 finalists on Saturday.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held in Raasepori, Billnäs.
Before the finale starts, you will be able to watch the atmosphere live on IL-TV.
The live broadcast starts around 6:30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, many Miss Finland winners have been invited to the final.
In the jury they are represented by Miss Suomi Jonna Ziprus from 1998.
Other representatives of the jury are the wellbeing entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Jounin Kauppa’s CEO Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiska’s news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd get into college before he went to the Mississippi.
Russian father Dimitri and Ingrian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter’s success in the Miss Suomi final.
The parents of the recent Miss Finland Alina Voronkova Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova proudly followed their daughter’s first moments with the crown on their head.
They came to the audience from Pertunmaa and planned to drive back home after the finals.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the arrival I was nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Ingrian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says that as a child, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than her career.
Alina was often told that when she's so pretty, she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It was only later that Alina got excited about beauty contests.
The parents wished that Alina would be able to go to university before taking part in the Miss Suomi competition.
This was the case, and in the end Alina wanted to take a bachelor’s degree before the Mississippi competition.
We asked him last year why he wasn't attending, but he wanted to finish the candidacy.
The parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He exercises a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be present, you can see.
Alina’s boyfriend Joonas Hurri is working in Japan, and he couldn’t get to Finland to encourage his lover in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that the young people's relationship will last for a whole year.
Yes, it is meant to be!
My parents hoped that my daughter would come soon.
It's been such a long break for the Mississippis.
I miss it, even though there are messages.
A young man was killed in a car accident in Lahti, where police arrested three people.
Police said three people had been arrested in connection with the incident.
On Saturday, Häme police did not comment on the course of the events or on the possible intentional overrun, citing the incompleteness of the investigation.
The police also did not comment on whether the persons arrested and the man who died in the accident knew each other.
Further information on the case will be available at the earliest at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic book came to mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
My husband used to say it when he suggested it to a story I was developing as a person, says Sari Piippo, a comic book blogger from Espoo, a housewife and a former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says that she was an EU translator in economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after her fourth child the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I enjoyed being a housewife very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I remembered what I would do when I was growing up, when even the youngest child started to grow up.
Then, in 2014, there was a cartoon.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was a child.
I had drawn the last time I was a kid, but when these Organic Hobbies manuscripts started to be born then the situation changed.
At first, I made dozens of manuscripts in a desk drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled drawer, but I couldn’t get her to join me until summer 2016, when I donated Viivi with a hard disk.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughs Piippo, who tells him that the record was a great stimulus for him.
A hard drive is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn’t even try to draw on paper,” Piippo tells about her relationship with drawing, which she usually does in the evenings.
Manuscripts pop into my mind all the time, but I don't usually finish them all at once.
One three-screen strip can take up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time and like to play with the colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest part, because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says that she appreciates contemporary newspaper comics, including Scott Adams’ Dilbert.
The characters of Organic Humppa are a carrot-breasted mother with a salad hairbrush who has been ravaged by L-theme.
The other characters are Man, Piss and Twins.
In the organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from our own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn’t want to preach or offer a straitjacket even though Organic Hobbies sometimes intrude.
She tells him that she will read her series with her husband and children.
It’s such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon you’ve drawn and say that’s what I’ve done today.
Enough challenges for the housewife!

Indonesian Earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - did not leave cracking tower until he secured hundreds of passengers
Indonesia's 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthony Gunawan Agung has become the hero of the earthquake.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until he was able to escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely off an island shaken by an earthquake.
The young man was in charge of the air traffic control of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Kirk, when the earthquake struck on Friday.
While others escaped from the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat until he was able to guide Batik Air's passenger aircraft from the runway.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation authority told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower shook and cracked.
In the end, Agung attempted to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered serious internal organ injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a spokesman for the Aviation Administration told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify after the flight was airborne, and its magnitude was finally measured at 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian aviation authority has honored Agung’s heroism on social media.
Rehn thought about Europe’s ending in trade war: “You have to look at the next tweet”
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the entire world economy.
Growth forecasts have been lowered all over Europe, and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth forecasts.
President and CEO Olli Rehn said in Yle’s first meeting that even though tensions do not have a direct impact on trade flows in Europe, they weaken confidence, which in turn is reflected in companies’ investment decisions.
This also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn believes that Europe is a good place to work for the time being.
It has been able to build a truce with the United States and has also helped calm the situation with China and Japan.
In his view, Europe does not appear to be at the foot of a trade war.
I have to look at the following tweet and evaluate it.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
There are also risks in Europe.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the Western world as a whole.
Yesterday, the market reacted harshly to the budget that the Italian government presented on Thursday night with a clear deficit.
Next year’s deficit will be more than 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problematic, and more than ten per cent of the country's non-performing loans are non-performing.
Moreover, its public finances are weak and the country appears to be once again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting any more crises, Rehn replied when asked whether Italy is taking Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another challenge for Europe is the UK’s exit from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be in harmony.
Disputed separation would have far more negative effects.
Rehn took office as Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
The President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, will resign in just over a year.
The discussion about his successor has begun.
Both Rehn’s and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen’s name has been blurred in speeches.
I’m sure it doesn’t matter if Finnish names are included, Rehn said, adding that he doesn’t intend to comment further on the matter.
HS’s super-popular Black Box shows continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box presentations organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again this week.
Other performances will be shown at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
On October 23, Black Box will visit the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and photographers appearing on the stage will tell a true story they have prepared for a long time, which has not previously been published in any HS media.
There is something else that no one has ever heard.
"There's a strange spy in the Helsinki Night, an impressive report from the other side of the globe and an appealing story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet the editors and photographers of HS and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organizing live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular since the beginning and are often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already been to the audience.
The Black Box was awarded at the Bonnier Gala as a journalistic act of the year.
The awardees praised the new way of doing journalism and the journalists’ desire to be close to their readers.
The Black Box of the spring season 2019 will be shown at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The presentation at that time has a different content than in the evenings of this autumn.
Missing sponge agent found thanks to "unprejudiced experiment"
Finnish police’s drone expertise is among the best in the world: “We are being asked about training”
According to the rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, in addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use the drone, for example, for crime scene investigations and reconnaissance tasks.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom killer in Raahe using a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, that “through an unprejudiced experiment and effective training, we are also among the world’s top in this regard.”
The drone is quite a new thing and even newer in police duties.
There is no statistic that the Finnish police are the masters of drone use.
According to Mr Himberg, there is a strong feeling that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the Finnish police drone operations.
We are being asked for training.
More and more common
Himberg points out that it is very important to find the missing person as soon as possible in Finland’s winter conditions.
In Raahe’s case, the missing person was found with a drone in just a few minutes.
Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are supposed to be trained more.
The drone is already widely used for police purposes, and its use will become more widespread and widespread in the future.
That's what I'd say, Himberg said.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use drones for example in accident or crime scene investigations and for certain kinds of intelligence tasks.
For example, one should already check out an area a little further away, where there may be fears that violence will be encountered there.
The drone can then be used for preliminary enquiries.
Karelian Rugby in the first division
Karelian Rugby celebrated the 2nd Division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuu team were still in the middle of the game with a 7-12 loss for the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found a plot and scoured the southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2nd Division Championship marked a historic rise for Karelian Rugby to the 1st Division.
Previously, the club had played in the first division, but at that time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the Finnish Championships and the multi-block 1-division.
The club is going to take a place in the league, but it will have a lot of work to do next winter.
The current roster of just under 20 players must be increased to 25.
The 1-division also knows the number of games to increase and the distances to play, so the fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi to start season in Montreal, confirmed by head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens, confirmed on Twitter that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal made a super promise to Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with number three in the summer draft.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has made strong strides in September's training matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal in his first practice match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big development steps after arriving at the rookie camp.
The NHL regular season starts on Thursday night.
Montreal will meet the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What makes a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk this week about leadership.
In an interview with HS, Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of Nokia’s Board of Directors, told about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila vehemently denied the allegations, but previous Nokia reports have talked about managers’ inability to act as a team; fear and non-speaking, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company’s risk-taking and agility disappeared during the boom phase.
During the week, the Nordic Business Forum, a giant business event, was held in Helsinki, attracting Finnish business cream to the Fair Centre.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 business stars appeared on the stage.
The talk of good leadership was enough.
Gary Hamel said that a good leader should have the courage to take the company to the future, even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, said that a manager must be able to communicate the company’s purpose to the entire staff.
It can’t just be about making a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of The Introverts of Success, said that the most successful leaders are proven to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the life cycle of a company.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown to a mature stage needs a leader who knows the numbers.
The Nordic Business Forum received 7,500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
They were at risk for information.
A good leader is required a lot.
This is why leadership often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other comradely.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for an outsider to judge.
Sara Chafak arrives on the red carpet from Los Angeles to spend most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland showy dress also featured a lace lace dress.
A little poden jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there,” Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to auditions in L.A.
He has, among other things, done advertising.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, he says that the work has to be done even harder, because there is always a replacement for the model’s work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group operating in the field of live art.
Danish police find large Volvo sought during operation: "We can't tell you what"
Extensive searches by the Danish police have yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the <0xC3><0x98>resund and the Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry services from the island of Själlland were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS contacted the shift manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The searched car has been found.
We cannot yet tell where the car was found, according to the Copenhagen Police Department.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo has no direct connection to the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Denmark’s Ekstra Bladet told police about Saturday’s news conference.
Investigator J<0xC3><0xB8>rgen Bergen Skov was silent about the progress of the operation.
He did not want to know what crime was being investigated.
Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people were sought during the operation.
Police do not say whether they have already been arrested.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
However, according to the police, there is no longer any reason to be alarmed by the general public, as the threat was directed against certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of discord - now the people will vote on it in strife elections
Macedonia, in the Balkans, is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, the Republic of North Macedonia would be named.
Greece has so far vetoed Macedonia’s efforts to join NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention the new name, but asks whether the voters support Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by approving the agreement.
The vote started sluggishly, at least at a school in the centre of the capital Skopje.
Retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, hoped that the agreement would be supported.
A referendum is a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
This is a change, especially for young people, he said.
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM)
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is exciting whether the turnout will rise above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but a yes vote would give a mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is needed to change the Constitution.
The Greek parliament must also approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
What a win!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper late on Saturday night in a heavyweight boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn took on his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch near Stuttgart.
The main game of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
The winner may have the opportunity to compete in tougher positions than those seen on Saturday, which are of considerable economic importance.
Helenius finished the match in the eighth round, knocking Teper out with a hard left hand.
Teper was no longer able to get up from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" wounded his opponent in the third round, when the German's nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to be fighting in December 2015.
That's when Teper pleaded with injury and withdrew from the game.
After that, it turned out that the German had been burned twice in a doping test.
Helenius has played 28 matches in his professional career and suffered two losses.
As a clear favourite, Teper has won 19 professional games and lost three times.
Hamilton with team order to win - Separation to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One champions approached their reassurance once again, as Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes won the Russian gp and stretched his World Championship lead to 50 points (306-256) for Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole position, drove second.
Bottas, who won his first career in Sochi last year, held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel finished third, Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was fifth.
Two men assaulted a Jewish man in Joensuu, arrested one block away
Two men beat and kicked a 31-year-old juukalist at Siltakatu 12 in Joensuu on Saturday after 6 p.m.
Police said the men also stole the victim’s phone.
The police reached the suspects, a 35-year-old man in haystack and a 39-year-old man in Ilomantsi, shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said.
The victim suffered bruises that did not require a visit to the doctor.

Canada is fighting against time to reach a deal with the United States on Nafta
Time is threatening to end in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement with Nafta.
The U.S. has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators in the two countries have had intensive discussions throughout the weekend.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly to fully focus on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement on Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The U.S. and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada’s involvement in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Due to these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday so that the US Congress has enough time to evaluate it.
Neighbor thought the candles were a fire in Kaakkuri - the fire department was alerted
The candles burned in an apartment building in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on Sunday night.
A dozen rescue units were alerted due to a possible apartment building fire.
We found out that the candles burning in the sauna of the apartment building had looked like a fire in the opposite house, which was why the emergency centre had been notified.
There was no fire at the target.
Police apprehended 11 people after Honka-HJK fight, raids on the field and subway station
The police arrested 11 people after the Honka-HJK men’s football league match in Espoo on Saturday, Detective Inspector Teemu Värtinen of the West Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was protection from crime and disturbance.
The detainees were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
Earlier this week, I told you about the evening.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators rushed to the pitch from the spectacle reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fistfighting between the supporters of the teams.
To end this situation, we needed, among other things, cavalry officers.
In addition to the airport, there was a brawl in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the captures also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the fighting that took place in the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been filed as a result of the incidents.
Table stone blurred its butterfly SE-time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tischakivi have advanced to the finals on the final day of the 3/7 World Swimming Championships in the Netherlands.
The Games are held in Eindhoven on a short course.
HSS’ Table Stone set a Finnish record in the 50-metre butterfly, where he was second in the first round at 22.82.
Earlier in September, Table Stone swam in Helsinki for a trip in SE-time of 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen from Cetus in Espoo was 24th in butterfly swimming at 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen finished sixth in the first round of the 50 m breaststroke in 30.48 and advanced to the final.
Laukkanen was 15th in the first round of the two-hundred-metre mixing at 2.14.25.
Students play a rare delicacy: an ancient tragedy - the simplistic Oresteia influences with its visuality
Tragedies of antiquity are a rare delicacy on Finnish stage.
For example, the last time the National Theatre saw an ancient tragedy, Sophocleen Philoctetes, was in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought to the tour starting with the National Theatre the only play trilogy of antiquity that has survived as a whole, the Orestia of Aeschylos.
In the Lavat avat! projects, which started in 2015, the theatre students work with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international premiere of Oresteia took place in Berlin in April.
Roiha’s atonement from Orestea summarizes the story of the end of the blood vengeance of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law in merit of an hour to twenty minutes, especially by summarizing the choir parts.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuur’s fine Finnish (2003).
Dramatic lights and a display revealing the sides of the theatre space underscore the simplistic and bright stage thinking.
Its focus is on the dynamics between the choir’s name role-playing performers and the choir.
Both double and triple renderings of title roles are used in the presentation.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who returned from the Trojan War, and his spoils of war, Kassandra, are also shown on the stage, contrary to the tradition of ancient performances.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize that it is faithful to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, a modern interpretation is created in front of the viewer, faithful to the text, constantly aware of its ritual-like roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out a rhythmic group of acting students from the master’s stage, appearing as a compact group, as a single organism.
Especially in the choir sections, actors who are flexible in their way to very expressive, sculptural group formations get their rights bare, only decorated with a white curtain, on the stage.
That's impressive.
Orestea’s performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
The new technology is beginning to show in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement between Hyundai and Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hannover IAA Commercial Vehicles Exhibition, Hyundai will supply a new model of 1,000 vehicles to the Swiss company and its partners.
With the launch of the fuel cell-powered truck, Hyundai continues on the road marked by the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a manufacturer of hydrogen vehicles.
With this world’s first project of its kind, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for ways to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network,” In Cheol Lee, Hyundai Motor’s vice president, said at the announcement of the agreement.
Fists fluttered several times in Kajaani
A man in his early thirties assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit a man inside the restaurant, and as a result he was removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and, in the absence of a third man, the abuser also hit him.
The police caught the assailant.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another policeman in the foot.
He also threatened the police with assault and murder.
He was taken to the prison to calm down.
The case is being investigated as three types of assault and violent opposition to the official.
In the centre of Kajaani, Välikatu, another incident of assault took place on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
At first, a 20-year-old Kajaani man hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked her down and the man who had hit her before kicked her.
The attackers were pulled away from the victim and the police were called.
The suspects left before the police arrived.
The police ask eyewitnesses to contact the Kajaani police by phone +358 295 416 520 or by e-mail at entisi.kainuu<0x40>poliisi.fi.
Long-range radio presenter Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, a long-time journalist at Yle, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yeah, we're on our way.
The doctor also said that I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of shop aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
I first received a salary for a newspaper article in 1984.
When you’re surprised by something on these yearly tires, it’s usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a working environment expert at the Finnish Service Industry Federation (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though employers say otherwise.
Only clearly perceived cases of seriousness go to the police’s attention, and many real situations of violence remain unreported.
"Obviously, companies are obliged to compile statistics on their near-miss situation under the Occupational Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in statistics.
The problem with violence has always been that it does not always lead to physical injuries.
However, psychic trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a situation of violence and a threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw, when even a certain level of aggressive intimidation must be counted as violence - even if there is no tackling.
Too many people are afraid at work, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some neighborhoods are uneasy.
The store has secured guards.
When the opening hours of the stores were freed up, the rumbling in the media was quite large in terms of its impact on the safety of sellers.
"At that time, quite a few employers organised guard services for at least night hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä said.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When the disturbances were kept well under control due to security, the impression arose that security would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, people are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive guard services.
Mild assault is a plaintiff's crime, and it is quite understandable that the abused salesman does not want to make a request for an investigation of a criminal who usually lives near a shop.
But according to the same paragraph of the law, passed in 2011, a slight assault becomes subject to the prosecution if it occurs in the workplace.
I believe that precedents are needed now.
The next time a shop aunt or uncle is beaten up, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should accuse him.
When a court puts a few assailants in jail and sentences them at the hard end of the punishment scale, habits would be cleaned up.
A society in which a grocery store must be open day and night, even in small towns, must guarantee the safety of its employees.
Heidi Sohlberg: "Sara, Iiro is married"
This year, Miss’s coronation will not be shown on TV in the traditional way, but will be shown on Viafree.
The show is hosted by former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studio host Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the hosts told the invited guests and the media about the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a loud applause.
Now all the women scream!
Look at this, our male presenter, Sohlberg gleamed at his colleagues as the audience cheered.
Many of the previous years’ Miss Finland will follow the front row games.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other and Sohlberg made a little joke.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg would look at Saro.
Sohlberg probably referred to the recently divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
She spoke about her divorce for the first time in the evening newspaper.
Missikaunotar said she did not want to reveal the reasons for the divorce in more detail in public, as it was between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he was not in a hurry to have a new relationship, he was going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own stuff and especially start living my own life alone,” Sara Sieppi said.
The marriage status of Harjula came to light even later, when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The hosts laughed at me.
You were married, weren't you?
Janni Hussi signed off on the mess.
A Nordic man tortured his unmarried partner by cutting, burning, and feeding him strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his cohabiting spouse.
The instrument of crime included belts, cables and bundle ties.
The court sentenced these items to be confiscated by the state.
Ranki was charged with arbitrary rape.
The District Court, however, dismissed this accusation.
The cocaine was blamed for four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threats, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty, and two acts of harm.
The crimes took place between March 26 and May 24.
At the end of his last act, he was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
Last Thursday, the District Court of Ostrobothnia handed down its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to be kept in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two aggravated deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed by the court as unproven.
The case was tried behind closed doors.
However, the judge gave a public statement of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted his spouse with violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been tied up.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, baited a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on top of it.
In its judgment, the court ordered the confiscation of the state’s criminal equipment: a belt and cable, bundle ties, a bathrobe belt, a knife and a lawn mower.
Four witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to coexist between the acts.
It can be read from the sentence that a large part of the most aggravated acts took place at the end of the criminal cycle.
The court heard four witnesses, two women and two men.
A 34-year-old victim must be compensated for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm in a total of 5,800 euros.
He is unlikely to have that money, as the convicted person is already in debt.
Prison is not a man's first time.
The newspaper does not give the name of the offender to protect the victim's privacy.
At the time of writing this, the court ruling is not final.
Europe leading by four points to the Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals captured their leadership in a traditional hole game match against the United States on Saturday.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup in Paris with a score of 10–6, with twelve singles still to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four four-ball games that started on Saturday, and in the afternoon's doubles game, the wins were equalized by 2-2.
Europe’s leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four paired matches on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had achieved this.
On Sunday, the two of us will go back to history.
No European player has ever won five points in one Ryder Cup, and only three American players have ever won it: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns violent harassment of supporters at Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
On Sunday, the football betting league team HJK released a statement condemning the disruptive behaviour of its supporters in the Saturday FC Honka game in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the pitch, and some of them seemed to be trying to challenge Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The policemen were unable to calm the situation, and policemen and horsemen were needed.
HJK said in a statement that the team’s players and officers were shocked by the incident.
Events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We strongly disclaim any activity that jeopardizes the safety of the match events," the statement said.
HJK promises to help the authorities and event organisers to identify the factors that threaten security and to eliminate the related phenomena.
Supporter culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We fully support positive, joyful and supportive activities in football stadiums.
"Violence is not involved," the statement said.
Philippine inventor flies drone car - how to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a growing number of people around the world who swear to have invented a flying car – or at least their own version of it.
As a competitor, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from around the world, the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made his first successful test flight - he flew with his device at an altitude of over seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will provoke positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts that tomorrow’s industrial action will be visible in children’s day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, the bans on overtime and shift shifts that will start tomorrow will be particularly visible in social and health services and day care for children, says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chairman of JHL.
The impact will be wide-ranging and will certainly be visible in such a way that there will not be enough staff on the ground.
Everyone has to think about how to get their kids.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services are in play and that no one’s life is threatened,” Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and shifts due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, for employees not to be hired, but to remain in overtime or to change shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
In terms of occupational safety, it is quite normal for every employee to take care of regular working hours and only do them.
JHL is opposed to the government’s intentions to reduce the protection of small companies against redundancies.
Markku Jalonen, Labour Market Director for Local Government Employers, will not start pre-evaluating the impact of overtime and shift change bans.
However, he does not believe that they will be very disruptive, although services may deteriorate.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what needs to be done.
The region is such an impossibly large, social and health services and technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary widely by industry, region and employer,” Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week, experiences were already gained from similar activities that lasted for three days, such as those of the Association of Nurses and Nurses Super and the trade union of the social welfare and health care sector Tehy.
Their effects were quite limited.
JHL’s overtime and shift change ban applies to employees in municipalities, churches, the state and private social and health care sectors, among others.
For example, childminders are excluded.
At this stage, nearly 100,000 JHL members are affected by the industrial struggle.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may last a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the redundancy act continues.
The government should now admit that this is a run to the wall and hard.
Jalonen believes that both the trade union movement and the government must meet him.
What is strange about this is that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen continues to update.
The Great Coral Reef is born by children and adults - in the fitness circles of the performance the gestures of the ray and the seahorse are studied
The Great Coral Reef was premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group’s previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that will be built from beginning to end together with the public.
This time, however, a more clearly defined presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is also fairytale magic for children.
The child’s perspective has already been taken into account during the preparatory phase of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children’s performance, but a performance made by adults and children in cooperation.
It provides adults with information and observations about how children receive information and make art.
Children’s ability to throw themselves into rehearsals and joint games also reduces the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef resembles a fairytale ballet, a fitness club and a nature event, but for good it is tuned around the visits in different, non-human conditions.
The Great Coral Reef begins with exploring the trajectories of corals and the creatures and fish that live on the coral reef.
Six different fitness circles teach the gestures of rays and seahorses, among others.
Finally, a performance lasting less than an hour, where music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef, there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and corals that are being viewed.
There are also organisms that look at corals.
Looks and observations directed in many directions make the performance dense and life-blowing.
Whether you are a landscape of some organism, a landscape-viewing organism, or another organism or landscape-and all of this at the same time.
It does not seem difficult for children.
In other spaces, the group’s exercises aim to reach the boundaries of thought and action, which is challenging when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals will be held at Sitratori.
Destruction beyond human comprehension should not be allowed to harden, although it might be difficult to understand the significance of practicing one’s own compassion in the face of the prospects of destruction.
In other premises, he has built his works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also by a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, for which it opens up space for wonder and play.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad I didn't have smartphones in my childhood
Children and young people today are becoming more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking as they become younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess with their lives because of intoxicants and sex, because others say they do too.
I was shocked when my friend told me that he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister over the weekend from his "boyfriend".
When he came to pick up his drunken sister, she told him about her sexual experiences that night.
I could not possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that we should not touch drugs and that sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today’s children will be able to have a decent childhood and will not have to grow up too early due to group pressure from friends.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram with makeup on their faces and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used in the evenings to take and send revealing pictures.
It is increasingly difficult for girls to guess what age they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smart phones in my childhood.
I was a child for many years and didn’t have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: Authorities told the government that the Airiston Helmi incident is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the Defence Police and the Defence Forces visited to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that Airiston Helme’s investigation is currently not related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle reports.
The information of anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by Chairman of the Defence Committee Ilkka Kanerva (kok).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Defence Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered a financial crime.
They were pretty strict about not speculating that there was anything else, Kanerva said in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle’s information, no evidence of a connection to national security has been found so far, but the investigation is only just beginning.
We cannot yet know what might be revealed, says one of the interviewees.
A week ago, extensive home searches in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is purely a financial crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, the newspaper compiled a story that discusses claims both for and against.
Video: Dream goal saves Liverpool's defeated series
Liverpool's 100% Premier League start was finalized, but it was still a more satisfied team with a 1-1 draw on Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to a 1-0 away win.
At the time, Pep Guardiola’s combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool manager J<0xC3><0xBB>rgen Klopp came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger, and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to dominate his own end of the field alone.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great League Cup away win at Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved right from the start.
In the 25th minute, he first played in a small space with three-player Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard rush forward and sent him a perfectly weighted feed through.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but from there bombarded the complete left leg of the draw to the back of the lower corner.
Alisson was a bit slow in his fight and only got his fingertips to the ball.
Klopp must have felt the defeat position lightly unfair, as almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah's lead from the finish line.
In the second season, Chelsea Vespa Kepa also got into action.
The Basque guard reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's pull and pushed the ball from the base of the pole to the corner.
At the other end, Alisson resets Hazard's pass.
The best place for the guests came in the 72nd minute, when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the Brass Star's bull's-eye was directed towards national teammate David Luizia, who saved the hosts' lead.
It didn’t last until the 89th minute when Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from the 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the assailant bombarded it in honor of an irresistible bet on the top corner.
Liverpool’s 100% league start was finalized in a 1-1 draw, but it’s still at the top of the league – together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also heavily involved in the championship with two points behind the tip.
The clockwork is deep.
I remember a few decades ago a magazine asked different Finnish influences what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Widow’s answer remained the only one in my mind: Nen-terminal.
Some people have nen in their last name and some don't.
There's no way there's divisions anywhere, and there's a bartender here.
In the EU, Finland has brought about the abolition of the annual clock change.
A lot of people agree that changing the clock twice a year has been a job for fools and has caused a lot of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest thing to do now is to decide what time of day you will end up in: the current summer or winter time, or some other time zone.
People can also say their opinion on this on the otakantaa.fi website.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday 12 October.
There is a lot of discussion on the coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has something to say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the effect of morning light on people’s well-being, and those who defend summer time with the effect of evening light on people’s outdoor pursuits and thus on well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies have shown that morning light rhythms the human day and gives vitality.
On the other hand, if you don’t particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light will increase people’s outdoor activity and give better opportunities for gardening in the fall, for example.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated per hour.
I’d rather take both, but bad for our location in the north of the world we can’t do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers are too light for many anyway.
What is typical of a debate on this subject is that one’s own view is pushed forward and another’s view is strongly opposed.
You don’t listen to the other person’s arguments, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on this, it is rather useless to try to turn the other person’s head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is terribly easy to debate, because it does not require much dedication and the mutu-feeling is enough to justify it.
Similar issues are usually debated more strongly and equally fruitlessly.
I'm sorry if the wrong option is chosen, but I think you'll adapt to it.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels sloppy.
Josba fought for a close away win
Josba's first away game at the floorball Divar gave Nurmo Jymy three full points.
Josba left Seinäjoki on his way home with a triumphant 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still leading the goal at the beginning of the third round, but Josba was looking for compositions and recycling men in chains.
In 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5-win goal.
Both teams played decisive minutes in the recess.
Josban’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was also fierce when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenki (1+0) also played in the second division at the time of his goal.
Josba has six points after three rounds.
Next you will meet O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
Eno's Church celebrates 200th anniversary on Sunday
The 200th Anniversary of the Church of Eno will be celebrated tomorrow in some very sad moods.
The arson of the church a week ago was a shock.
The church was also guarded two nights after the fire.
In spite of the pain, today is still a place of celebration.
Even if no one wants to, Eno’s church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the municipal and other associations of the world.
The family fair starts at Eno Church today at 10 a.m.
Then we move to the parish hall to the Karelian banquet table.
There is a lot of stuff on the show all day, both inside and outside.
For example, the church building can be visited with the guidance of the retired Ari Räsänen, who has served as a parish master for 37 years.
The birth of the church also marks the end of an era.
The parish hall, which was built in 1982, is now open for the last time.
Now we are in dodge rooms in the former municipal building,” says the chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The church building was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla's head of government, charges of fraud settled for <0x24>40 million
Tesla and Elon Musk, the company’s chief executive, have settled their lawsuits with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The SEC suspected Musk of having been guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he had established.
Musk will continue as Tesla’s CEO.
Musk is forced to step down as Tesla’s president for three years.
The company will have to hire an external chairman of the board.
Musk will also be subjected to stricter controls.
The agreement requires Tesla to hire two independent executives and to monitor Musk’s communications more closely.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will both pay <0x24>20 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla shareholders," said Steven Peikin, director of the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk tweeted that he might pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company’s funding was secured.
The tweet temporarily raised Tesla’s share price.
The SEC suspects that Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was "false and misleading" and Musk had not spoken about an arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it was suing the company and Musk.
The SEC said it would demand that Musk be fined and banned from continuing to run listed companies.
The SEC's challenge frightened investors, and Tesla's stock started to fall sharply.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesian tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country’s disaster agency, according to the AFP news agency.
The number of deaths is still expected to increase, as the investigation of the damage is ongoing.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday’s earthquake triggered a tsunami that struck the town of K<0xC4><0x81>l on the island of Sulawesi.
A warning of the tsunami was issued immediately after the quake, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all of the known dead are, at least for the time being, from Palu.
Rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area close to the quake centre, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
The Ruins of Help
The Indonesian army has been called in to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the area today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue work day and night without exhaustion.
At the heart of the rescue is a hotel in Palu, where 50-60 people are still believed to be in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, the head of the agency responsible for the rescue, said that one person was found alive at night at the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, which is a favorite for business travellers.
We also heard people asking for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy demolition equipment would be needed quickly in the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend’s family members are still missing, one of the authors pleaded in a Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to shortcomings in the encryption of the app.
The incidents involved, among other things, access to the telephone numbers of the ministers.
It was an application used by the British Conservative Party in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, were harassed.
Several members of parliament received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption in the app, the audience had access to the profiles of politicians that were in the Conservative Party's annual meeting mobile app.
The public had access to the profiles using the politician’s email address, which was easily accessible online.
The person logging in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson’s profile picture to a pornographic picture and the title to an insulting one.
Michael Goven’s profile picture was changed to Rupert Murdoch’s.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log on to other people’s profiles using their email addresses.
You can then view the profile person’s contact information and send messages in their name.
The meeting app made the phone number of every journalist, politician, and participant public, Foster said.
A Conservative spokesman apologised for the leak.
He said the technical problems have been solved and the app now works safely.
The British Information Authority (ICO) supports the leak.
The application was developed by Australian company Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party criticizes that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Suomi quiz has a large group of applause Poles in the audience every week
Attentive viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi.
The US format The Wall, which has spread rapidly around the world, landed on the Finnish version of Four last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, has been shot in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
The possibilities for filming in the Polish studio were exceptional, as the large 12-metre-high gaming wall of the format required space from the farm.
During the initial period, the programme’s studio audience was highlighted on social media, which was considered Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate about whether the Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the Finnish game.
Unne Sormunen, Head of Finnish Programmes at Four, will shed some light on the matter for Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience consists of players’ close relatives, other Finns living in Poland, and just Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international applause in Finnish production, just like the audience of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to the descriptions of different programmes, Sormunen explains.
He reminds us that watching a game in itself is not so incomprehensible, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish.
For foreign-language speakers, however, interpreters will be present in the studio to carry out the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneously for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of lapdog is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with the way David Hasselhoff was treated recently in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff took part in the filming of Talent Finland in Finland.
He was constantly receiving simultaneous interpretation and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish during the filming, Sormunen sums up.
A typhoon in southern Japan is heading towards the main islands, warning of landslides and floods
The authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the typhoon Tram, but authorities say major injuries have been avoided and so far no fatalities have been reported.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters and more than 300,000 households have lost power.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and high-speed trains are sometimes stopped due to the storm.
The storm is expected to hit near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
The capital city of Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but it is also expected to have strong winds and rains.
Trains were canceled in Tokyo today.
According to weather scientists, Trami is torturing Japan until Monday.
The sky of the Asses darkened even more
The early days of the Asses have been bad.
The sky became almost pitch black when the team lost to Vaasan Sport 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Pori team now has five consecutive losses, and there are two points in six rounds.
None of the Asses' defenders or two lower chain players have scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing all the time.
The audience was already out of the hall against the sport when there was almost half of the game left.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
We have to worry because we played so poorly.
Particularly the performance of the second round was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who did 1+2 for Ässi, told me.
Of course, the sport was winning.
The team had a game down from Friday, so you would have thought it would show up in the making.
Maybe it did, but the aces didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors to Bread Day continued to grow
Pirkko Hyvärinen, the mother of Bread Day, wonders about the audience in the big hall.
Somehow I thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyvärinen thinks in the morning.
In autumn 2017, the Finnish Tractor Candle Championships were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps we would expect that the number of visitors could even decrease a bit from the previous year.
But the opposite happened; the corridors were already clogged before ten o’clock, the sellers reported that the products were out of stock, more news porridge was sold than before for almost 500 servings, and Hyvärinen heard that the number of cars had risen.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, Hyvärinen will tell later this afternoon.
During the five hours of the morning and afternoon there was a special programme for families with children, which I think attracted them to a record number of places.
In addition, Hyvärinen expects to reach the event even further away.
Salespeople also turn to Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year, nearly a hundred presenters, sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvesting products had arrived at the bread keeper.
Bread day mother PIrkko Hyvärinen admired the audience from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the Bread Day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children’s series Teija Kiviniemi’s beautiful bread won the public vote.
The children’s bread competition received 11 different shapes of bread.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the rye bread competition, spent the day in the martian pie shop.
7 x most beautiful lamp - this is how you will recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere for your interior and read the book without exhausting your eyes.
It is worth investing in good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director at Innolux.
Do Your Eyes a favor
The importance of lighting increases as more years of age are behind us.
Sufficient light can help with the problems that many people experience with age, as visual acuity decreases and more and more people suffer from glare.
As you grow older, the need for light also increases.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
Therefore, it is worthwhile to invest in the healing effects of light and the properties of the luminaire for health reasons.
A good luminaire gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
A beautiful interior can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
The designer of the moment can afford to choose.
Popularity is an elegant Japanese style that combines Scandinavian and Japanese style.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the 70’s, with its strong colours, metal tones or ice cream colours, has also risen to a boom.
The authenticity fascinates me just as much as the rest of the interior of the home.
The materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express Your Personality
On the other hand, more is being invested in the home than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a customized, bold luminaire for your home that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origins and designers are known.
So let’s be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
You don’t necessarily buy the latest trend luminaire for your home, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain types of timeless, jewellery-like and elegant classics keep up year after year,” says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the Canadian striker the door after three games
KooKoo and attacker Brendan O'Donnell split up.
The Canadian striker played three league games in orange black without points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year contract that included a probationary period until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old forward played for the Kunlund Red Star in the KHL and for the KHL farm in the VHL in Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new company is not yet known.
A gamer wants to set an example in recycling - goods go out to the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
Nowadays, Pelimies recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packed, for example, in packaging from importers.
All packages that come to us will be reused.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in a condition to be used,” says Ville Puurula from Oulu.
As a cushion material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we will be moving to recycled materials in envelopes.
They want to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra inconvenience.
It is not a big problem to start recycling.
It will also save money when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling suits the operations of Pelimies naturally, as in addition to new products, the store’s core product range includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Buying Every Fashionista: One and the same shirt works on every outfit
The classic clothes work from season to season in the outfit as well.
With their versatility, they lay the foundation for a good wardrobe, as it is easy to assemble a variety of outfits around high-quality classics at an affordable price.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes black polo.
Black knit polo studs made of natural material can not have a flaw catch.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, blunt skirts and jeans, and around it you can create both a discreet outfit ensemble and a sizzling style.
The polo sweater is suitable for both the youthful modern dresser and the classically sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trendy look comes from golden brown and wide-leg corduroy trousers, black polo and grey ankle boots.
The classic polo jersey, along with other classics, the blue-green scottish skirt and burgundy loafers, form a feminine and refined outfit.
Add some edge to the black polo knit by combining it with casually trendy garments: denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Youthful and stylish!
Russian intelligence has a long tradition of sabotage.
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this policy.
During the Soviet period, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian word diversionno-razvedyvatelnaya gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents of the Soviet Security Service (KGB) in the Western countries prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says KGB archivist Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004), who defected to the west.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB provided DRG groups with uniforms and accessories for covert operations of the Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they wore local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up checkpoints on roads from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from its motherland.
During the Cold War, agents hid ammunition packs containing mines, explosives, detonators, and communications equipment for sabotage groups in the terrain.
Back in 1998, a KGB cache was discovered in Switzerland, when a landslide exploded when it was sprayed with a water cannon by the authorities.
Police arrested four drunk drivers in the area last night.
Police in Northern Karelia caught four drunk drivers in the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti blew 1.57 per mille.
At half past three o’clock in the night, he was driving at the beginning of Kajaanintie with two passengers.
At four o’clock in the night, a 19-year-old local man in the car blew 1.54 promille, police said.
He was not seriously injured at the exit.
In the centre of Outokumpu, a 20-year-old man from an outside town who was driving a passenger car blew into the alcometer at 1.33 per mil.
The police suspect these male drivers of aggravated drunk driving and the driver of Polvijärvi, in addition, of endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning, a 36-year-old man carrying a local van at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie in Tuupovaara blew 0.52 per mil.
He's suspected of drunk driving.
Police are requesting observations of a stabbing at the Turku railway station after midnight.
Police said the man was beaten in a parking lot in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
It was recorded on a surveillance camera.
The suspects, dressed in dark trousers and brown or beige jackets, left Ratapihankatu in the direction of the bus station immediately after the stabbing in a dark station wagon.
One suspect left Humalistonkatu in the direction of the city centre by bicycle.
Pedestrian killed after hit by bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after a bus hit him.
The accident occurred after 4 a.m. on Raumantie near Niittumaä.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the incidents that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen’s probation period ended
Mika Toivola, sports director of Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (centre) has been important to the team in starting, underpowering and defensive roles in the fourth field.
Filip Riska, who played in the early autumn, will continue in Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club leader.
Filip has been an important part of starting, underpowering and defensive role in the fourth field.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold on to such an experienced player, HPK sports director Mika Toivola said in a statement.
According to Toivola, the value of Riska increases when playing the ice hockey league decision games.
Riska, a central striker from Pietarsaari, has previously played league hockey at JYP, Luko and Sport.
Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the trial period.
Previous articleTrue story on TV today: Climber left to die twice
Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on his own experiences.
The movie is based on them.
Everest will now premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm struck climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Korm<0xC3><0xA1>kur’s 2015 directing tells the story of a struggle for survival that has been dealt with in a grainy way.
Films and documentaries have been made about the tragedy before.
The real events will also be discussed in this case.
Twenty-two years ago, the highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who guided Weathers.
Weathers’s life could have been saved by an eye surgery performed before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of this and the pressure of the air, he lost his sight, so the conquest of the peak had to be skipped.
Rob Hall continued his journey and never came back.
However, Weathers’ struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came, he lost his way and could not find his way back to the camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn’t believe in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
But miraculously, he got back on his feet and found the others.
Weathers was thought to be still dying and was once again left to his own fate.
It is clear that Beck Weathers survived, contrary to other expectations.
At some point, the fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility enough that he was given help.
Beck Weathers is portrayed by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrate the 200-year-old Church of Eno
The 200-year-old church was celebrated today.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and a celebration was prepared for the whole family.
The party started at 10 a.m. at the family fair in Eno Church Hill, after which the Karelian banquet table was served at the Eno parish hall.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family fair.
Armi Rautavuori, the vicar of Eno, was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great joy for a long time and will give strength to the work, Iron Mountain (pictured) says.
The fire in the Church of Accelerating Danger has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of Eno’s parish.
Eno’s church is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran congregations in Joensuu after the destruction of the church in Kiihtelysvaara in a fire.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a worship service was held in the danger of accelerating, in which the church that was destroyed by fire was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: Medicaid flashes its power in Greece - The sea vanished and the street turned into a river
A strong hurricane-like autumn storm hit Greece from the southwest on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane is called Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Pictures taken from the area show plenty of flooding across Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows that a river has suddenly appeared between the houses in the city of Kiato in the Corinthian region, instead of a street, due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused heavy seas.
The Finnish embassy in Athens on its Facebook page instructs people to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The embassy urges you to follow the weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medicament, brings with it heavy rains and even flood risks.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, medics appear only once or twice a year around the world, typically around September-October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm now blowing left floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey to the north and towards Europe.
There are also refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to adequate shelter.
The area around Athens, which was destroyed by fires in the summer, will also be affected by the storm.
In Greece, the medic also raged last November.
You don’t have to go to the sea now, but flights are still on schedule – thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Trips to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, be careful not to fly branches or other bulky items over in a storm.
These guides have been distributed to over 3,500 Finns in Greece who spend their holidays through Aurinkomatkat.
Instructions are needed, as even the horrific storm Zorbas is predicted to be beating Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speeds can reach up to 45 meters per second in gusts.
The weather is aggravated by heavy rains.
All those who travelled to Greece from Finland via Aurinkomatkat and Tui, who have given their phone numbers, have been warned of strong winds by a text message, according to the tour operators.
Still in the air sun and heat
According to Inka Ikonen, a specialist in communications for solar journeys, the worst has been avoided in the resorts by early Saturday evening.
For example, flights have landed and taken off according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we are monitoring the situation all the time.
Safety comes first.
Antonia Schroderus, a media assistant, said their flights were also on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff.
At least it was still peaceful in Crete, he said on Saturday evening.
The most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, currently have more than 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred travelers spend their holidays in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos will arrive on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon in Rhodes the sun had shone and the temperature reached 27 degrees,” says Aurinkomatkat Ikonen.
Zorbas is expected to become Turkey’s next turmoil, albeit with some relief.
We have already contacted Turkey and our staff there to check the number of Finns flying to Antalya with Tui, for example,” says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Huss have identical evening dresses in the Missifinal – this is how they reacted to the situation
Media persona and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived to the Miss Suomi final on Saturday in an open-backed evening dress.
Hussi says he bought a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me the perfect dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress was chosen by host Shirly Karvinen.
The two also noticed their similar outfits and reacted to the situation with a laugh.
Karvinen told Evening Sanoma that she was in a hurry to get ready, and she had to get dressed on the plane.
Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet host in the Mississippi Finals, and talks to the leading stars.
Huss has recently moved to Jätkäsaari from Kamppi on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
The main thing is that the new apartment has its own study, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi was on vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only in the hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When the stress started, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful,” Hussi says.
Shirly Karvisen’s behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention – attracted the prying eyes of pensioners
The host and Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen of 2016 told on the red carpet of the Miss Suomi final that she had enough to do with radio shows and Love Island Finland shoots.
There has been so much rush that Karvinen came to the final directly from Finnair’s flight.
I put my hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
Changing the evening dress at home, Karvinen laughs.
Carvinen says she pulled out her makeup in the middle of the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was amusing, at least for others.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says she enjoyed her job as a host of Love Island Finland.
He also said that his experience has been stagnating so far.
Karvinen says she went to say hello to the singles on Friday.
It's really raw in some way.
They are people’s genuine feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the programme’s singles.
How do I wear over-the-knee boots?
Three perfect examples
Classic clothing is a piece of clothing that works from season to season.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes even the most modern ones can be accommodated.
The overknee boots that became the hit shoes of the autumn and winter season a few years ago have not gone anywhere.
As the name suggests, the boots above the knee are repeated elegantly from year to year and from season to season.
Appearance boots share the opinions of users, but a bold model is worth trying, well - boldly.
Over-the-knee boots are actually suitable for any outfit.
Whether it’s a tail, lace, tulle or jersey, the boots have a simple leather or artificial leather surface that works.
Long boots look great in festive look as well as casual outfits.
Black overknee boots are perfect for gentle outfits.
They suitably balance the femininity of a pink, floral pleated skirt and a delicate, bulky knit.
A fresh but autumn-style everyday outfit for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit is created from a long copper-brown velvet dress, overknee boots, eye-catching earrings and a studded little bag.
Even though the overknee boots have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for casual everyday wear in combination with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
It's so easy and yet so stylish!
Two robotic cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo says.
Otaniemi’s robotic cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as traffic in the area will be launched by a robotic bus next spring.
The project develops and pilots year-round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will reveal how robot cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Traffic Management Manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time ever, robot cars will run fully automatically among the rest of the traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the auxiliary passenger on board.
The vehicles sense their surroundings with several sensors at all times and assess whether the roadway is open.
If not, they will interpret whether the obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or a snowflake, for example, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for developing robotic traffic.
Robot cars run all autumn three days a week: on Tuesdays from 13:00 to 15.30, on Wednesdays from 10:15 to 15:00 and on Thursdays from 10:15 to 15:00.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Robot car stops are recognized by the stop markings.
The safest way to get in is from Otakaari stop number 1.
The bassist of the Mokoma band fell off the stage during the gig and was injured.
Mokoma announces on their Facebook page the unexpected situation at the Tampere Pakkahuone gig.
Mokoma’s concert in Tampere’s Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band’s bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was doing the last song of the evening.
The spider's wrist was broken.
The band announces this on their Facebook page.
"We're in the spirit!"
Yesterday Santtu stumbled from the stage in Pakkahuone in the last song and broke his wrist.
Wishing the metal brother a speedy recovery!
The rest of the tour will be done by a spare crew, it says on the website.
The fans are worried about a photo update where bassist Santa lies with a plaster in his hand on his bed.
This news has been awaited, there was a lot of concern about how bad it was going to be.
The relief is great, the bones improve, fortunately, over time.
Good luck to Santu and good luck to the rest of the band!
And thanks for yesterday, it was a great gig, but will you promise to leave out such a strong drama from the end of the gigs? writes a fan.
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting supervision on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Wildlife Agency in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department’s wilderness contact persons reported on social media on Saturday.
The main focus was on the legality and legality of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state land.
In addition, the permits for the possession of hunting weapons and the permitted quantities of self-loading guns used in channelling were inspected.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found during the surveillance, who lacked the required hunting permit.
The hunter was ordered to pay 12 daily fines for unauthorised catches.
Police also blew up 133 drivers, two of whom were suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in a fine procedure, the police time.
In conclusion, hunters follow the hunting authorisation very well.
Many hunters were surprised by the inspection.
One hunter said, “I’ve been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone checked the permits.”
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to supervise hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen to Turkey to monitor selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey in the next few days to follow the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
This year, it has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps to Finland.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick people, women and children.
More people will be selected for the group coming to Finland than there is in the quota, because in practice some will not arrive for different reasons.
Silkkänen will also meet with Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs operating on the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, will also accompany the trip.
Increasing the quota
Finland has been taking in quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but there has been no agreement in the Government since then to increase it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has failed in the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) recently proposed a gradual increase of the quota to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Silkkänen’s visit will be the first one that the Minister of the Interior will make on the spot to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Ministers of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Oct.) and Paula Risikko (Oct.) had time to move on to their new duties before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10,000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go to the wrong places - don't know whether to cry or laugh anymore
Last Saturday, Karjalainen announced a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill prohibits, in principle, the keeping of all animals as farm animals, pets or otherwise in connection with business activities, which are not specifically permitted by the regulations of the ministries.
Therefore, everything else is in principle prohibited, except the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill becomes law, it will probably mean that we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the law explicitly prohibits activities that endanger the security or good manners of society.
In principle, the prohibition of all activities that are not specifically authorised by law or regulation is now being laid down.
The change means that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business operations and nothing else can be done until a law or regulation adopting it has been adopted.
The government’s work in drafting legislation in general has been weak.
If we start on the path that everything in Finland is basically forbidden, which is not specifically allowed, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act requires an update.
But a bill in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept this 'everything is forbidden that is not specifically permitted by law or regulation' procedure.
Hopefully, there will be a reasonable minister who will stop the progress of such a bill.

Johanna Tervo was hired as the head of the kindergarten.
Turkey urges to charge mobile phones in case of storm
Zorba storm in Greece is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the storm in Greece.
A tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
Disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens on Saturday evening to charge their mobile phones before the storm and make sure the internet connection is working so that people can get up-to-date updates on the situation, according to the local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been told to stay at home and away from windows, and to move garden furniture away from the wind, for example.
Turkey is expected to receive heavy rainfall and winds are expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete in southern Greece.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece of the storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were advised to follow the weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A while ago when I got in touch, there was a lot of wind and rain.
The people were calm,” Communications Manager Laura Aaltonen from Tui told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had also not received any messages from Finns in distress.
In Greece, several ports were closed on Saturday, the local news agency Amna reported.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, the travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions were expected in air and ship traffic.
Finnair said on Saturday that the weather situation is being actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen says Mercedes is better than Ferrari
Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen admits that Mercedes was the worst competitor in the time of the Russian gp.
There is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver said.
They were just faster than us, but there's no such thing as a huge thing.
Our car was the best in time all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth in the race with teammate Sebastian Vettel, Räikkönen said.
Ferrari had a hard time last year in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked what caused the sudden fall from the Mercedes.
They seem to be going faster than we are - as simple as that.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go at the same speed as them.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In the time slots, a rare treat was seen for Räikkönen’s upcoming team Sauber.
Räikkönen's replacement for Ferrari, Charles Leclerc, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final time-riding session.
The tenth place for the Swedish driver is the best in more than three years.
And even though five drivers did not drive at all in the second session, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging to Räikkönen for the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the beginning, then the step forward has been a big one.
There's a different story next year, so let's see.
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart went smoothly.
The German was a more proactive player in the ring, but he did not get a decent hit.
Helenius, who was clearly more prolific, controlled the match with his hard sets, which found their way well.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked out Teper on the left.
The hit was so hard that the fighter in front of the home audience didn’t even try to get out of the carpet.
When the victory was confirmed, Helenius ventilated quite moderately.
At first, he praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he changed his language to Finnish.
Thank you to all the spectators and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helena was delighted right after the match.
It was a big win for Helena’s career.
There might even be a chance to get into a World Cup match, Helenius commented to Iltalehti before the match.
The loss, however, could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's occurred to me.
This doesn’t get any younger, Helenius, 34, admitted before his meeting with Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country’s vice president is calling for a clear increase in the number of victims.
Vice-President Jusuf Kalla said the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are searching for those trapped, as well as the dead, in the worst-affected areas of the island of Sulawesi: the port city and the neighbouring village of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, the situation in Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they have heard the screams of people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of the rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to rescue and clear.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as in the disaster area electricity and telecommunications connections are broken in many places.
Fuel reserves are also depleting.
Miss Suomi’s hesitant response and long reflection caused a laughingstock
At Billnäs Ruukki, a new Miss Finland is currently being chosen.
In the interview round, each finalist was asked a question.
The finalists raised the question of the glass bowl on stage.
Especially the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23,’s hesitant response gave the audience a sweet but benevolent laugh.
The question asked Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what was the latest book the Missifinalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good while before he started doubting.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is..., Anttikoski said, thinking.
The audience laughed until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I have read is...
I read books at school!
Probably something economics-related.
So the last book I've read is about economics for someone, Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a loud applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the Mississippi tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he didn’t want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
Miss Finland 2018 will be crowned at 9 p.m. when last year’s Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm gives up the crown.
Sike's apple-pear cake takes your tongue away
This recipe is for those of you who have good, sour apples from behind, as domestic apples in the store are shockingly expensive.
You may have to buy a pear, even though a lot of people are already growing a pear tree.
This cake can also be made only from apples, if you do not want to buy a pear.
Of course, the taste will be more varied if you also put that pear in the cake.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seed pods.
Slice.
Melt the butter in a saucepan.
Whisk the eggs and sugar until foamy, then add the corn flour and melted butter to the foam.
Combine cornstarch (maizena) and baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread pan with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread the pear slices on top of the sugar.
Spoon half of the dough on top of the pear slices and apple slices on top of the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple slices.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let cool in the pan and then undo the serving dish.
Cut the cake until cooled.
The cake is fragile in structure and easily crumbs, because the dough contains almond and corn flours that are gluten-free.
International crime fiction event will be held in Ruka in January
In January, an international literature festival focusing on Nordic crime literature will be held in Kuusamo Ruka for the first time.
The programme of the Nordic Noir event consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary issues, as well as jazz music.
The festival’s literary guests include the star of Swedish detective literature Jens Lapidus and the Swedish duo Jerker Eriksson and H<0xC3><0xA5>kan Axlander Sundquist behind the author’s name Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to the Swedish names, the event also features writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers will be represented at the event by Max Seeck.
According to the organizers of the festival, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique surroundings of Kuusamo provide a framework for a unique written experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two slightly different types of "coolness": the generally attractive coolness and the opposing dissident coolness.
Charmingly cool people, according to the researchers’ description, had many traits that were considered socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, amicable, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They were thirsty for experience and paid little attention to external evaluations.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
Kovis’s role in the long run isn’t cool: high teenage status doesn’t necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who went out early, partyed, got into good-looking groups, and sought the favor of others had an increased risk of intoxication and criminality as young adults.
In their relationships, they fared poorer than their less discreet peers at the time.
A high-status message from a lock susauto, badge or watch does not make a person cool - or at least a genuinely attractive companion.
In a study published in August in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, the vast majority of people were more willing to make friends with people wearing a regular market shirt than with those wearing a brand shirt – despite the fact that most people chose to wear a brand shirt when getting acquainted.
If you are on the Greek holiday islands, beware!
There's a hurricane hitting it -- a weather warning screaming red
During the weekend, it can rain as much in southern Greece as it does in Finland on average in six months.
Hurricane Zorbas hits Greece this weekend.
Be prepared for this if you are in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the embassy, the Greek meteorological service has issued a red weather warning to the areas.
The upcoming storm is also reported on the weather service Foreca's blog.
According to it, the storm’s hardest gusts are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the storm Kuisma, which hit Finland from the beginning of the week, blew its loudest at a rate of 31 metres per second.
However, according to the blog, the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimetres of water may come to the south of Greece.
This corresponds to about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the storm on its Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the men's drooled Love Island Finland duck?
Appears in confusing YouTube videos
Few people know that in the series Love Island Finland, Anku, who is drooled by several men, also appears as a craft aunt in the strange YouTube videos released in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises craftsmen, among other things, to make a octopus from an old household paper roll.
The duck also shows in his sympathetic style how you can make a hedgehog out of tights with the right spikes.
Now let the Easter weeds grow, but let's do it in a surprising way, Anku hints and introduces sawdust, stockings and weed seeds from which he makes a hedgehog.
You can watch the videos below or on Anku’s YouTube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more tens of minutes after his pole position in the Russian gp when he was in front of the media.
The good lap left Mercedes' number-one star Lewis Hamilton behind and it was definitely mentally important for the Finnish rider who collected criticism this season.
Nice ride.
“I don’t know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the solution round.
It feels good, I’m still shaking a little bit,” Bottas explained.
I’ve only been to the pole once this year, in Austria (in midsummer), so time has gone by quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good rounds again.
It is not easy to skip the track in Sochi, so the start is particularly important.
And of course Bottas was able to answer the question of whether he will win tomorrow or whether he will be able to win Hamilton, who is approaching the World Cup title.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I’m trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the pole, Bottas swooped.
But as a team, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis’s lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference with me is very big, so we have to keep that in mind.
Let’s see what happens, though.
After the race, Hamilton was genuinely happy about Bottas’ success, and the Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff also tasted it.
Lewis had an intention to beat Valtteri, but he did not succeed in the seventh corner.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything off of himself in order to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff said.
When asked if Bottas and Hamilton would be able to drive fairly, Wolff evaded.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen wins the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM-series of rallying ended rarely.
Never before have the two brothers become Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was Eerik and Henrik Peterinen from Tuusula who won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class in the final rally around Turku and Salo.
Kitee-based Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish Championship in the SM4 category of two-wheel drive cars.
Kinnunen, who competed in Honda Civic, and Ville Mäkelä, a map reader, started the Turku competition with moderation, because the starting points were clear: a ranking in the top group would guarantee the Finnish Championship title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the two had to level out when some of the extra lights failed in the second special test.
It was still a bit of a blind spot for the third one.
In a situation like this, you can't relax.
On Saturday, we only followed the pace of Jussi Tepo, who was second in the series, Kinnunen said.
Syria demands U.S., France and Turkey withdraw troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister has called on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said foreign troops were in Syria to fight terrorism, and that the war against terrorists was “almost over.”
In his speech to the UN, Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the seven-year war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that a meeting was planned for October with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who has been accused of harassment, have had an unusually large number of people face the scene.
In the United States, a full-fledged Supreme Court judge-appointment drama caught at least 20 million people on TV on Thursday.
At the time, Donald Trump’s Kavanaugh and California professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell his story.
According to the preliminary results, the hearings were followed by six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to them, the online consultation was followed by several millions more.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed the live stream, and CNN reported that it had set its yearly record for 8.2 million live streaming launches.
CNN’s figure will rise to more than <0x24>10 million, including those who have watched the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made 8.0 million launches.
The digital start-ups are the channels’ own, and the TV viewers’ figures come from Nielsen, a research and data analysis company.
Nielsen will release the final figures on Monday, but they will be huge anyway.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, audiences of more than 20 million are usually limited to sports matches, major Oscars and Grammys in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
The U.S.’s most watched annual program, the American Football League’s Super Bowl final, is a long way off.
This year, the Super Bowl attracted 103 million people to NBC.
Last year, Trump’s first speech to Congress was viewed by nearly 48 million people and the inauguration by more than 30 million people, according to Nielsen.
A matter of paramount importance
The Supreme Court’s nomination is an extremely important case in the United States, as the posts are for life.
Trump was able to nominate one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016, and Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from nominating a replacement.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was a so-called scale language whose voice could rule on the position of a nine-member court.
He was a proponent of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, he ruled with his vote that same-sex couples got the right to marriage throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court could lock up the conservative supremacy of the court for decades.
Children have the right to receive their information from parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see their children’s health information from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation with the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not see even the health records or recipes of the babies.
In autumn 2016, the situation was corrected for persons under 10 years of age, which was classified as temporary.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an astonishingly long time to do so.
The correction is now in place - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change in the legal basis should not have been more than a roll call.
After that, the layman’s understanding is about pressing a button: now that the cord is closed, we open it.
Of course, a child can show his/her information to his/her parents if he/she has bank credentials or an official ID card.
But how many ten-year-olds do?
An ID card is paid, and a 10-year-old does not even get a bank ID.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the information of a fourth-grader in elementary school except by requesting it in printed form.
It is not so much about the rights of parents as it is about the rights of children.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that the parents can be involved.
The right of teenagers to privacy must, of course, be safeguarded.
Even minors may have family situations where not all things can be freely talked about.
Often they are related to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the United States, the FBI began cracking down on Kavanaugh's allegations of harassment.
According to the U.S. media, the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment by at least two women.
One of the women was present before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during her studies.
US President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation must not take longer than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation, and it may not be made public.
Man Threatens to Kill Police Officers at Police Station in Kajaani
The booby-trapped squirrel continued to squirrel even in the chamber.
Police said they had put the man in a police prison to "calm down".
Police were threatened by a suspected assailant in Kajaani on Saturday night.
The official reports a case that began when a 30-foot-tall man challenged a quarrel in a central restaurant.
The man first assaulted another client inside a food store.
This led to the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by knocking him down.
When the third party tried to intervene, the man also hit him.
A triple assault led to a police call.
The patrol picked up the man and took him to the Kajaani police station, police said.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
Police said they sent the man to a police prison to "calm down".
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition to the official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia – “Clean water is the most urgent”
UNICEF and other international aid agencies are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, UNICEF’s Communications Manager.
Local authorities are in charge of rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has a full emergency response capability,” Haru says.
The first task now is to find the people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
Please, in the city of Sulawesi, rescue operations are underway, but the situation in the Donggala area, a little further north, is more unclear.
There are still places where connections don’t work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, Haru says.
Buildings at Sulawesi are often light-weight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is huge.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter -- first, tents, for example -- and clean water.
In times of crisis, clean water is the most urgent.
For the first time, people are usually offered water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
The aim is to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported first, for example, by trucks.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding family members and reuniting families is part of UNICEF’s mission.
Food aid is provided by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the United Nations.
In the initial phase, the funds raised previously will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF has already started raising money to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk announces <0x24>20 million fine for tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of space rocket and electric car companies, avoids fraud charges by signing an agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits his job as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors and agrees to a <0x24>20 million fine.
Musk resigns as part of an agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
By agreeing, Musk avoids fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with securities fraud because of his tweets in August.
In it, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, which led to a rapid increase in the company's share price.
According to the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to serve as chairman of Tesla’s government for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new “independent member” to its Board of Directors and include two “independent executives” in its Management Team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.
Musk will continue as Tesla’s CEO.
In addition to Musk’s personal <0x24>20 million fines, Tesla will also have to pay <0x24>20 million to the financial regulator.
Tweets mislead investors
According to the SEC, Musk’s tweets misled investors and Tesla’s shareholders.
Musk claimed he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange into a private limited company.
According to the billionaire’s tweets, the company was bought out of the stock market for <0x24>420.
After the tweets, Tesla’s share price rose by more than ten per cent in a day, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk’s allegations had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with any other management team or the company’s board of directors.
On Friday this week, the exchange rate dropped 14 percent as the SEC reported a fraud charge.
The news of the agreement is expected to strengthen the company’s course again.
The last sentence is not a reason.
The cathedral bells do not naturally ring when the pointers do not move.
It's a technical problem.
The clock at the tower of Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The wise men point to twelve o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror movie: even when the church crypt is exorcised and the organ sounds to itself.
Of course this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it is broken.
It has been visited by a repairman, but a part has been broken and a new part is expected,” says Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned in the Twitter account of the Church in Helsinki.
The last sentence is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says the church bells don't ring because of the bug.
