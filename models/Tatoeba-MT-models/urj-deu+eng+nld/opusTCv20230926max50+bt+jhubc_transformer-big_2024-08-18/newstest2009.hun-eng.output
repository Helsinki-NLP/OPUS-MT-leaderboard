The Prague Stock Exchange is at a negative at the end of trading
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the crash this morning.
Transactions with shares of the Czech Energy Company (<0xC4><0x8C>EZ) accounted for almost half of the daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued to plummet as early as Tuesday’s trading started, when it fell almost six percent.
This time, the decline in Wall Street shares is behind the decline.
This is how the market reacted to the vote in the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan to stabilise the financial sector there.
Fall of shares in Asia
Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic fall in stocks on Tuesday, although the indicators eventually canceled some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock market index depreciated nearly four percent of the trade, but later canceled some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai closed.
The Sydney stock market lost more than five percent, but the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
According to the Taiwan Stock Exchange Index, the stock market fell by 3.6 percent.
“The timing of the U.S. rescue operation is uncertain and will affect the world’s financial markets,” said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong’s Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Central Bank of China.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that U.S. lawmakers should resume talks immediately and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will feel the consequences.
The Bloodbath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, to which <0x24>700 billion (almost <0x24>12 trillion) should have been spent.
Legislators have thus ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks went through a bloodbath, and leading stock indices recorded the biggest drop in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell nearly seven percent, the last time it fell was in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal had not been adopted in the House of Representatives, the index began to fall free.
Congress Withdrew: US Government Could Pump <0x24>700 Billion in Banks
The U.S. Supreme Leaders of Congress and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed to broaden the deal and provide financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in negotiations to approve the rescue plan in the form of <0x24>700 billion (about 12 trillion kroons) in financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
But there's no victory yet.
Congress must complete some of the details of the agreement before it can publish the final form of the law and their vote.
The financial support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Reuters news agency Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Institutions Committee, said on Sunday.
According to Senate sources, the bill will likely be voted on Wednesday as soon as possible.
According to economists, there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in reviving the financial markets.
Due to the complexity of the mechanisms, however, a "sound-up" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have taken a big step.
We have resolved our differences of opinion on the form of the package to stabilize the market," Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
The final vote could take place on Sunday.
Legislators met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Saturday to formalize the government fund.
It should buy out the unsellable mortgages from financial corporations, which plunge financial corporations into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are close to reaching a final agreement on a draft that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
The improvement plan needs to be continued, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
Democrat senator Harry Reid of Nevada said lawmakers would seek a final settlement in Congress on Sunday.
This is intended to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, where the time zone could be the first time that Congress’s decision could affect Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the bill, nor is it clear whether the trial will not be blocked at the last minute due to a problem.
The legislators hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is still undergoing a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
The first <0x24>350 billion should be made available as soon as possible.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount, which was set at an additional <0x24>100 billion and later at <0x24>350 billion, if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function.
Bush assesses progress in negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was to acquire financial assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that were losing their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgages.
“We worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate should be able to vote on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, Bush’s spokesman, said the president was pleased with Saturday’s progress and appreciated “the bipartisan efforts to stabilize our money markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of busus severance payments
Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said the legislators had agreed on the responsibility for the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing discounts, and timing of the financing plan.
The new law also limits the so-called busas severance payments of directors participating in the program and establishes a supervisory committee for the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Treasury Department.
"We've worked very hard on this, and we've made great progress towards an agreement that will work and benefit all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also includes assistance for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new installments for the mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly installments of debtors and enabling them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual aid
According to David Marek, Chief Economist at Patria Finance, the proposed project is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
“This is because it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be acquired.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will allocate the losses to each other," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
According to Marek, it doesn’t matter if the plan is approved now or early next week.
“More importantly, Congress should decide this week to support the plan and give its blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of reaching an agreement on whether the plan will be approved is the most important thing at the moment," Marek said.
Pairing on the edge of the blade: MP3 players versus mobile.
We help you how to choose
While almost all mobile devices can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be used to make a phone call.
This makes it clear that it is better to just buy a phone.
However, there are many reasons to buy a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
It’s probably hard to get a high-end, expensive turntable for your home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc disc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on vinyl records, but there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if your shelves are full of art rock, jazz, or blues vinyl records, you’re probably dreaming of having a record player like that.
This is similar to traveling, i.e. compressed - simplistic with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to give out eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to find it difficult to accept a 20 crown market headphones.
There are two extremes between which everyone has enough space.
There's a lot of choice.
Battery life also counts
Some high-end music players can do much more than just play music, but also something that most mobile phones just don’t.
No device is as universal as a phone.
In addition to the primary functions of phoning and texting, it can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera, and even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can take photos.
However, multifunctional mobiles also have disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more times the display sends it to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobile phones, therefore, count on not playing for you for more than a few hours.
If you’re on the phone here or there, get a charger for your workplace just in case – this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have this problem, even the worst ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
The next issue arises when uploading music to mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but only a few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in mobile devices without an adapter.
With a few exceptions (iPod), players do not need any special software.
It is enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB.
Most mobile phones and players already create a music library that is sorted by the artist, album, genre name, or user rating, for example.
Some devices only depict a tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles know more
When choosing a specific device, ask about the battery life, memory capacity, sound output quality and type, and of course, the convenience of handling.
If the music is primarily used as a background for you and you only listen to it for a short time every day, for example on the tram, any MP3 player on your mobile phone is suitable for you.
This is something that any mobile phone can do.
You don’t even have to pay special attention to what music formats your mobile or player knows.
With MP3, they all cope, and the vast majority of the music you get will be in exactly this format.
MP3 is one of the most widely used, and in addition to it, the vast majority of the devices also cope with WMA format music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Better mobiles also allow you to buy music online, for example.
It is enough to visit the relevant pages of the service provider (or other service provider) via the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service in itself can be a strong argument for the purchase of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the providers’ offerings are poor and usually limited to annual radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it can be assumed that the music industry will be dominated by this particular form of music sales (either via GSM, the Internet or wireless internet).
Most people carry their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you’ll feel your mobile phone in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is lying at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry your headphones or at least your hands-free handsets.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which almost all mobile, but only a few MP3 players have.
For many, the biggest advantage of music mobile phones will probably be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a pretty decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you are limited by the lack of a traditional headphone output.
The best and most technically equipped phones with traditional 3.5mm hole headphones can cost up to 15,000 crowns.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, the ease of operation.
With the simplest - not necessarily the cheapest - players (see our selection), really everyone can cope.
Minimal function, handling comparable to a traditional cassette recorder or gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collapsing in the form of accidentally turned on mobile internet, and no risk of data transfer for the subsequent huge bill.
What device to choose
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have slots for removable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
Buying the right card can cost up to 2,000 kroner.
But be careful.
The basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones know what to do with up to 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Based on the capacity (up to 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1,100 kroner.
If you belong to the more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the convenience of the operation is closer to the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, which has a walkman series of mobile phones, has the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the aforementioned brands can provide the same service in the same price range up to 4,000 kroner, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in the Czech Republic later this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, there is something lacking here - a virtual service provider that forces classic service providers to significantly reduce prices.
Maybe it won't be much longer.
On the Mobil.cz website we have written many times that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which pointed out that SMS prices in the Czech Republic are more expensive than in other EU countries.
After the latest move by the European Commission to regulate roaming charges, this may lead to a controversial situation - some customers of Czech mobile operators will find text messages from abroad cheaper than domestic ones.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple: there is no real competition.
This may sound contradictory, as we have three mobile networks and our penetration is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are keen to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, often agrees with this, and has previously stated on several occasions that there is no place for a new service provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic provider with its own network probably doesn’t have too many chances anymore (however, it’s probably hard to find a frequency).
But there is another option - a virtual service provider.
It was the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market that led to a significant price reduction, after which the classic service providers had to react.
Even before big fish such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile came to the market in the UK, there were sounds similar to ours.
However, it has been proven that such providers have a place and can be truly successful.
However, for example, we do not have to go too far.
In February this year we informed you about the launch of Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
In less than six months, this service provider managed to attract more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which is also the owner of U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility to focus on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate efficiently, you need far fewer customers than a traditional service provider.
It does not entail relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world thus tend to appear low-cost - they offer inexpensive calls and text messages, which, however, is often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers text messages at least 50% cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a target group can be quite a good move.
This service is specifically focused on men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - who they like, who they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual service.
It is difficult to say whether the same idea as in Poland could work for us.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory in terms of service offerings.”
This is not possible in the Czech Republic, according to mobile operators.
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem too hopeful.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our region," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman for Penta Finance Group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it has demonstrated that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not overly sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they do their best to prevent any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group has not concealed its interest in launching the virtual service provider for some time now, which is taking another step towards making Telefonica O2 a true competitor in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in providing not only fixed but also mobile telecommunication services to our customers.
And the sooner, the better.
We have discussed this possibility again with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, the group's spokesman.
Maybe now's a better time.
Unofficial information suggests that we may be lucky enough to have our first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
His birth is surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment, we do not believe that there is room for a fully-fledged virtual service provider in the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very special.
Until now, we have not been approached by a single subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," he told Mobil.cz from Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica 02 press department.
Other operators also refer to the special situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman for T-Mobile, in an exceptional agreement with O2, adds: “We have not yet recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business projects on which to build further.”
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will appear.
We should have a concrete agreement on the table at the moment so that we can think about it in the short term.”
Vodafone will focus on fulfilling its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most rewarding for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to partner to build shared networks for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - on the same footing with service providers
The behaviour of the mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of a new operator would increase competition, lead to lower prices and thus reduce their profits.
So why should we make it easier for such a competition to enter?
When service providers are interested in something, they are able to work together, as evidenced by the turmoil surrounding the birth of U:fon.
The biggest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>TU was probably around the birth of T-Mobile’s U:fon.
The publicly available information on the <0xC4><0x8C>TU website bears witness to this.
But right now, the U:phone is a good argument for not allowing the virtual service provider to log in.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> added: "The competitive environment in the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of a new player into the market and its services would be subject to high demands."
However, in view of this attitude of the mobile operators, the complete disinterest of the Czech regulators is absolutely staggering.
In the meantime, it is not just the attitude of <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, has no right to interfere in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
Only the Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
But the agency has a characteristic attitude towards the whole problem.
“The entry of the virtual service provider into the mobile market would only be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider for the leasing of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contracts have been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers," said Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chlapua from the Department of External Relations of the Hungarian Competition Authority in answer to our question.
A statement made by the representatives of the service providers in this way would probably not surprise anyone.
However, it is more than odd that an agency that should represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, should ensure that no one can abuse its position on the market.
Especially if Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: “In foreign countries, where virtual service providers usually operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile services.”
However, it is probably not in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to put pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and on the reduction of prices.
In this case, it is indeed shocking to see the very touching consistency of the reaction of the three mobile operators.
The question of whether this is really a coincidence is almost self-evident.
Just like at petrol stations, the exact same gas prices are surely the work of chance and tough competition.
"The Office has not discovered any signs of anti-competitive conduct in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers have a leading position, i.e. a proportionately higher responsibility for their market activities.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual service providers are also likely to be lacking for the telecom regulator," Chalupa said.
The presentation of the market leader position is one of the many points of controversy.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>TU, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator is in a leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - the creation of a virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - relatively logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
So in a certain segment it is necessarily dominant.
But even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators act in a strikingly similar way.
Meanwhile, a series of complaints from interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in the course of negotiations with all operators.
And shifting responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>TU is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS takes its hands off the whole case.
We have seen this in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted telecommunications law, the extension of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications could not be implemented, although many experts hoped that this would improve the situation.
This should be well known to the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, but their interests are probably different.
It works when no one is watching.
In the meantime, the operation of some sort of fake virtual service provider will remain unnoticed, many of which are already operating in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, which, however, are only partially public.
These are multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to the selected ones.
The charm lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer against the service provider, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a priority customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar advance purchases.
"If there were any cases of which you speak, it would be a breach of contract that we would deal with and that could lead to the termination of our cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> answered our question about this problem.
But it's highly unlikely that news of this kind of activity hasn't reached the responsible people of the mobile operators.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, there may be thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider will defend itself against such a procedure.
These companies have not insignificant profits from their activities, and at the same time, unlike real virtual service providers, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, however, the services of these companies are used by only a negligible percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have it in its entirety, as is the case with the general customers of mobile operators.”
But that's what <0xC4><0x8C>TU should be weird about, at least.
In addition, another question arises for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile service providers are blinding themselves to the same procedure, why are they preventing the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has a relatively strong authority to expose this type of activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with an explanation from the service providers that nothing of this kind was suspected and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has already been said a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable decrease in the price of services.
In the meantime, in virtually every country where virtual service providers have been established, classic service providers have tried to more or less prevent their establishment.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that regulators intervened, which were not protecting the interests of mobile operators, but the interests of their customers.
Then, either through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are handing the whole case over to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competencies are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider really does appear soon, the Czech mobile market may be back on the move.
If one of the service providers would allow the creation of a virtual mobile operator, <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will find it difficult to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be able to make more expensive phone calls.
There are four new versions of the Czech anthem.
Choose the best
Listen to the four processings of the new version of the national anthem of the Czech Republic.
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek presented the new recordings of the state anthem Where is my country? on Czech State Day.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre led by Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, with vocals or instrumental.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka are singing.
The anthem was modified by Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
At iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vs consider the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he deliberately chose young singers with a representative voice to sing solo variations that were expressive and popular.
"From the very beginning, I tried to ensure clear diction, clarity of the text and consistency at both of them, and later at the orchestra," he said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Where Is My Country?" was first performed at the Rendi Theatre in 1834 by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n in Tyl Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka, complemented by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously considered it their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
After the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state emblems.
What is the "new" hymn
Prague transport company delivers chip card for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, enter the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passenger to board the subways, trams and buses will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available to around 100,000 people who have an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy 30-day, 90-day and annual coupons (valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the Transport Company at the Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kabylisah, Rajska.
Coupons can already be purchased online from yesterday via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers in the afternoon hours.
Those who start using internet commerce can finally forget about the renting windows of the metro stations, where they have had to stop regularly for long lines of tickets.
The coupon can be purchased online and stored on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers will have a counter with trained servers who will help those interested to shop online and save their purchased coupons on their card," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, project spokesman.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can be saved to Opencard in self-service vending machines installed in a few lobby areas.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, remind of ticket operators, and passengers may have noticed them at Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1> metro stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but there should be 80 by the end of the year," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The ticket is automatically checked instead of the driver.
Managing vending machines that start operating tomorrow is simple.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved automatically.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also in its vicinity.
So on the trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, with which mainly residents of the districts of Central Bohemia travel to the capital.
"On trains classified as integrated in Prague, drivers are equipped with card readers, which can be used to check the zone validity of coupons," explained Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the Ropid organisation, which compiles the Prague public transport timetable.
In the buses around the city, card readers are installed at the driver’s desk.
When boarding, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard in the location specified on the side of the checkout.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the vouchers.
"If, for example, a passenger needs to check the validity of a voucher, the easiest way to ask the driver to do so is to do so," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not take buses around the city and do not remember when their coupon expires can go back to the self-service vending machines that save the coupons on their cards.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
The Sudeten want a referendum from the United States.
The Sudeten Germans requested the annexation of <0xC5><0xA0>umava to the United States in 1945.
This is clear from the letter in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, a group of Sudeten Germans allegedly appealed to the President of the United States with this wish.
This is also evident from a letter from a private archive, which is now kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
The Germans at <0xC4><0x8C>esky Krumlov are urging the US president not to allow the return of the "Shumava County" to the Czech Republic, which was still occupied by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
“We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that the American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, signing the words, “People who care about the fate of Shumava.”
Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia to the Sudeten Germans, in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character, can only hope for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the US President to take over the protectorate over Shumava “now and forever.”
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million people, he would condemn this territory as a foreign country that oppresses and devastates the minority and would contribute almost nothing to the victory of the Allies,” the letter said.
The reason the authors were not allowed to sign is allegedly because of the fear of revenge from the “Czech oppressors.”
If the President of the United States were to doubt the opinion of the Germans in Shumawa, it would suffice to hold a referendum in Shumawa County on whether its people want to become part of the United States and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive, given the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians believe that it adequately portrays the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that they would be expelled from the country, only a few of them recognized this possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Britain would agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others hoped that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
During the war, Chalupa served as a German at Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the navy in the Baltic Sea.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and sent to a prison camp in Hol<0xC5><0xA1>tynsk<0xC3><0xB3>, dozens of other Czech Germans joined him to teach them Czech.
"They were hoping that when they returned home, they could use the Czech language," Chalupa said.
He said that none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war had expected to be deported on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
The media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday, would be characterised as such.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek hopes to deter leaders from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The <0x24>150 million campaign will be featured on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and flyers.
Drivers should be discouraged from speeding and alcohol.
And you should remind them to fasten their seat belts before they leave.
It seeks to address the consciences of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what's in the advertisements?
Emotionally offensive, primarily human stories.
The slogan of the whole campaign is bloody:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" on the license plate is in big letters.
And there's the word "pay" in the pool of blood.
This must symbolize the fact that a man can pay for a moment of inattention with his life.
Advertisers will be “intimidated” by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of victims of accidents can be viewed regularly.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, let it go to the drivers
"For drivers, the 'pull it, let it go' system applies.
For them, 'let it go' is when, for example, they go through the red, thereby saving time.
"Pull" is the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk,” says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why we need an information campaign in the press, especially a negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
According to him, the signs that draw the driver’s attention to the danger are less effective.
"If a hazard warning board is installed, it will probably merge with the environment soon and drivers will not deal with it," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n warned.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, the president of the Provisional Israeli Government, spoke about the return of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, that is, the west coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published Monday by Jediot Achronot daily.
“We need to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means we need to return almost all, if not all, of the occupied territories,” Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we must transfer a similar percentage of Israeli territory to the Palestinians, because without it there will be no peace," he said.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
“Anyone who wants to be safe in Jerusalem and above all wants tractors and bulldozers not to cross his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, must give up part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to the attack on two cities in July, during which a few people were killed and a few dozen injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a “special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical places” in the Old Town.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won’t work,” he stressed.
Exodus from the Golan Heights
Olmert also commented on the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, calling it an essential condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require a certain effort from Damascus.
"I do not recommend peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan," he warned.
“The Syrians know what they have to give up in order to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they must give up the regular support they give to Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (the holy war) terrorism in Iraq.”
Questions After an Accident: Are Stewards Illegal in Buses?
The law does not recognize them, you are not allowed to walk in long-distance buses
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether cabin crews and passengers could travel in the bus while travelling.
“If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the conduct of the flight attendant would be in conflict with the Transport Act,” said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a 22-year-old flight attendant was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
Unfortunately for her, she was sitting next to the driver at that moment, in the least safe place on the bus, although two more seats were reserved for her.
The bus may crash or suddenly brake at the moment when the stewardess serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
There is a role to be played by whether the bus has a parking space according to the license.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency have no stands; this was confirmed to Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, director of the company.
“We tried to find a solution to this with the ministry, and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
However, this was withdrawn, and we concluded that passengers can use the toilet during the journey if they have their own seats," he said.
The law does not know the flight attendant.
“There is no clear legal regulation of the role of a cabin crew member – there is no law governing this position.
However, the carrier is not prohibited by any law from providing services.
The Act on Road Traffic only knows the concept of vehicle attendant; it does not define its rights and obligations,” says spokesman Hanzelka less clearly.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operations of the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, believes that the law adequately addresses the problem.
“It depends on whether the bus’s license has a parking space.
And that's the end," he says.
Buses and coaches may be urban with parking spaces and limited to the maximum speed, as well as between cities with parking spaces and permitted higher speeds, and long-distance without parking spaces and seats with maximum speed and seat belts.
Like on an airplane, says the expert
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, a traffic safety expert at BESIP, does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of cabin crew on board buses.
“There are not many dangers in the course of continuous progress, the situation can be compared to service on an airplane.
We don’t know when there’s turbulence and the flight attendant can hit his head.”
“But if the bus suddenly brakes, of course its physical laws apply.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of flight attendants must be resolved by the carrier with internal rules," he says, and also believes that the problem is not solved from the point of view of law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to discontinue services
The Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer cabin crew services.
It employs 200 flight attendants.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the flight attendant's job is risky, I'm going to terminate it.
Coffee and newspapers are available for passengers on board.
That would also save money,” he said.
Alexei Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of the flights compared to the Student Agency, justified the lack of cabin crew in his vehicles for safety reasons.
"We have no flight attendants, we have been against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this will result in some sort of fatal injury,” he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz just a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
A young flight attendant from Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who had been working for the company for two years, died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the lane without the use of a direction indicator and stopped the bus.
The bus driver suddenly tried to escape by manoeuvring, but the right front of the bus hit him.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the sale of two reserved places for cabin crew rest.
"These places cannot be booked on long-distance flights, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
By compensating the girl’s family, the agency does not wait for the court’s verdict, but expects financial compensation from the offender as well.
Amendment of law?
In the distant future
The amendment to the law, on which the 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could clarify the movement of cabin crew on board the bus.
“The group has not achieved any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, but rather the point system deals with the maximum speed allowed on the motorway and mobile use while driving," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of cabin crews to be anything that fundamentally threatens the safety of passengers,” spokeswoman Hanzelka concludes, adding that the police and labor agencies are responsible for monitoring the safety of buses and coaches.
The hopes of Düsseldorf depend on Frankfurt.
The letter from WestLB’s board of directors to the bank’s staff is not lacking in big words.
The merger of the units of the Düsseldorf financial institution and the Frankfurt Deca-Bank could create “the central capital market organisation of the savings bank financial group”, the letter reads.
WestLB would introduce a permanently profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a link could provide a decisive impetus for further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of a board of directors trying to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
After all, the precarious WestLB bank continues to be under enormous pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the provincial government of North Rhine-Westphalia that the deadline for finding a lasting solution is limited.
For savings bank customers, however, a kind of relationship between Deca-Bank and WestLB, which is famous for its investment funds, has been a topic for some time now – also from the Frankfurt side.
At the end of August, when decabank manager Franz Waas announced the half-year figures, he said that the merger between a bank on Mainzer Landstraße and a provincial bank such as Helaba or WestLB would not make sense.
However, the Board of Directors of Deca, which consists of representatives of the Landesbanks and the savings banks, has mandated the Board of Directors to conduct negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
This may involve the capital market business or certain parts of it.
Negotiations, however, say financial circles, have only just begun.
With 3,000 employees, the name Deca-Bank, one of the most important employers in the financial sector in Frankfurt, is not the first to come up with the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003, for a moment, it seemed that Deca-Bank would merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing came of this threefold alliance.
The plans were scarcely made public, the Hessen provincial government spoke out against Helaba’s interest.
The other two banks did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was instead transferred to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of a relationship between the Deca-Bank and the provincial banks has been raised again and again.
More recently, however, the chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, Günther Merl, spoke out against the plans to merge with his bank.
Nonetheless, it is recognised that there is a need for convergence between the various banks in the public sector.
Now, after the Bavarian Landtag elections, the first contact between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, he may gradually run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, he could only be a younger partner, although the financial crisis has hitherto been much better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was excluded at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which had a 85% stake in Helaba.
For the better, NordLB will remain.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
Merl said in June that the German Association of Savings Banks and Gries has not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should be used to secure the future of the Landesbanks.
Finally, there is the possibility of splitting up WestLB, which, of course, is not desired there.
Thus, the letter from the board of directors there also states that they are definitely looking for a "full solution".
How this can be reconciled with the merging of individual units with Deca-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian Weekend"
It's Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth.
Now, however, Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is completely different, says Luca.
Behind the five-litre barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a man with a strong beard, and he tells some 200 people travelling to the Oktoberfest how deep the sounds he can draw out of his throat.
Elena first faces Luca and then kisses her.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking near Puorta Nuova station, four buses depart at 23.45 to "destinazione Monaco, festa della", arriving at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved mainly for Italians, the fourth for Brazilians only.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans began to sing alongside their flags and began to celebrate during the night.
And so loud that it’s not for Italians,” says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long, faux fur-lined jacket and wide, silver-sided spectacles.
He has travelled to the Oktoberfest for five years, only this year he organized three trips.
At night there, during the day at the Oktoberfest, home at 10:30 p.m.
Accomodation would be an unnecessary expense, Marco says.
The trip costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75, which includes a welcome Kaiser beer brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, accident insurance and a German-language tour - Marco has completed a German language course in Frankfurt.
And already buses dive into the night on the highway in the direction of "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus is quiet and the passengers are asleep.
That's fine, they'll still need their strength.
There are breaks in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many Italian buses even take a short break in front of Munich on Highway 8.
When Marco’s team arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 a.m. as planned, there are nearly 50 other buses coming from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives one last briefing, describing the plan of war.
First, everyone put on the yellow cap.
On the left side of it is the inscription "Oktoberfest", written in the letters "Oktoberfest", and next to it is the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the gates of the beer tent open, run," Marco shouts into the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in advance, for we are stuck, and let not all those with yellow hats sit on the same benches, but let us be scattered in the tent."
The one-litre jar costs 8.25 euros, Marco yells.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that you're behaving well.
As soon as you leave your seats, they will be taken.”
Thirdly, "Tonight at exactly half past eleven, you'll be here again." Do you understand?
And we're on our way to Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men binds yellow hats as a road sign on trees, on boards, and even on election posters of one of the great Bavarian people’s parties.
We need to prepare for retreat.
This is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact figures; 50,000 people crossing the Alps invade beer tents, with ten percent of all visitors this weekend reportedly coming from Italy.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven South Tyrolean policemen, with Italian volunteers assisting the Bavarian Red Cross, which, with about 200 medical treatments in its national statistics, takes first place among Italians, ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and the British at the bottom of the podium (about 60).
The Hofbräu beer tent is especially popular among Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said last week.
It is fortunate that the politician used the word “relatively” and even made it clear that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because that happened this weekend.
Dax-listed Munich-based real estate company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received billions of dollars in loans from a consortium of German banks to protect itself against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies would amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate will only have to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes partly from private and partly from public banks.
The background is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, Depfa, which provides public funding, has lent money for long-term projects and has refinanced itself for an extremely short term - which is now impossible due to the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and its equity ratio also declined moderately, from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Current income and net income from cash transactions fell to zero compared to the same period last year, while income from claims credits and certain securities, as well as from the liquidation of the provisions of the credit business, declined by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
It was only thanks to higher revenues from the reimbursement of the ex-post settlement costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest pursuant to the Tax Decree and the transactions for the companies belonging to the Group that the revenue gap of around 16% was relatively moderate.
After the privatisation in 1990, the former state-financed company first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated in Aeral Bank.
Due to the low potential of classical public funding, Depfa has invested more heavily in infrastructure projects and private-public partnerships (PPPs) with the state, and has expanded its activities internationally.
The value of the subsidiaries must now be written off by Hypo Real Estate, which has a "significant impact" on the group's profit and loss account, the statement said.
In fact, no dividends were paid.
Dividends were cut to a third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure funder since the takeover of Depfa.
It is more dependent on interbank market refinancing than other financial institutions as it does not have client deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has slowed down as banks keep their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets annually to refinance part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – some <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group’s funding needs are covered by the loan for a foreseeable period of time and the company is protected from “the influence of the international financial markets that are currently largely unworkable.”
According to other sources, the refinancing will be secured by the end of 2009 thanks to the money.
On the other hand, HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the financial markets for a foreseeable period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now assured.
This gives hope to the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamic and immeasurable nature of the crisis, they cannot be certain.
It is not even inconceivable that you do not need to make full use of the funding.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After Saturday’s late-night news that the bank was still on the brink of bankruptcy, its temporary rescue could not reassure the spirits.
The share price fell by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
By contrast, bond prices hold up fairly well.
While debt ranked first hardly changes, the prices of subordinated bonds have fallen significantly.
In particular, the crisis affects the bonds of the former subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo, and, as is available, the maturity beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds used to appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their value stability is now to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system due to the escalation of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution almost brought the crisis home with the takeover of Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to start from the timely repayment of annuities.
Or there will be something that almost no one now dares to hope to overcome the financial crisis in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the reports of partial nationalization, the probability bounded by certainty has now been reduced to mere legitimate hope.
For long-term lenders, the decision to give up their investment can cause sleepless nights.
Short-term investors can, however, use the sale to create a reserve for taxes on exchange rate gains in the coming years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Inside Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce herself at Tachibana Highschool on her first day of school, the girls start giggling: The German girl is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word manga - in the new exchange student blog she talks about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was so excited.
On my way to school, I was inflamed.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, towards Kavasaki, and I travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, but fortunately I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start to squeeze in from 8:00 until 8:40 a.m., a short conversation starts with the teacher, the "home room".
But before I started teaching, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have my school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my hostess, with a blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
In this dress I stood before your catheter and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana ..." - My name is Sylvana, I am from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language for over two years.
All 31 girls were whispering, smiling and waving, and I kept hearing the word "kawai."
I know this from my manga.
It's part of the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls, and it means "cute, sweet."
Then I hurried to my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled broadly, feeling honored to have the exchange student seated next to her.
The rest of the clock was quite calm, but when the bell rang, they rushed in orderly.
Everyone talked and laughed, and with their questions they bore a hole in my abdomen -- though it was quite difficult to understand the Japanese's English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their booths.
My host prepared a lunch for me too - it's completely different from the boring German brunch sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, lettuce made from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of tofu rolled meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The dishes look strange and have a completely new taste.
In fact, everything is very delicious.
Yeah, except for the salty plum sauce, brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
In Japanese schools, bungalows are not just lunches.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a self-made bento, which she puts together especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can observe this here as well.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because it just fascinates me."
After all, I have been reading manga for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture described in them, I started learning Japanese sometime.
It was clear to me that I would have to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And these are very cherished here.
Japan, on the one hand, is a country of the latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats have emotions, too.
A rat or a moth is fleeing in the face of danger. Does that mean he feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can we examine whether they feel the same when they act like us?
In the online journal "Edge" famous scientists have been publishing their articles for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE looks at the answers to the question "What do you think is real without being able to prove it?" in one of its series.
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it, and it is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we examine other species and dissect the issues of perception or consciousness in general, we come to a difficult terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does what many other animals do: pretending to be dead, fleeing or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, from which some researchers deduce comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult for us to transfer our own subjective experiences to those of animals.
On the one hand, circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive/control functions).
This vast area is more developed in man than in other primates, and appears to be completely absent in other organisms.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as knowing who we are, or in the case of the ability to plan and make decisions, it is reasonable to assume that man is different even from other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since much of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
However, even if it were not dependent on language, it would certainly be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness is like in other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and it cannot be analyzed due to special hardware based on our own experience, then its research poses serious problems for us.
Most of my explanations are about the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is probably more accessible to science.
The consciousness processes of animals could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in experiments on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in this hypothesis, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick have examined, they rely more on the neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may or may not be the same.
Interestingly, this hypothesis also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the formation of visualization.
What does this mean for emotions?
This is due to the fact that an emotional system, like that of fear, is activated in a brain that is aware of its own actions.
What we call “fear” is, therefore, the mental state in which we are when the activity (or consequences, such as bodily reactions) of the defense system localized in the brain occupies a working memory.
In this way, emotions are closely related to those areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of primates, and especially of humans.
Complemented with the linguistic nature, perception is subtle, because with the help of words and grammar we are able to distinguish and categorize states, to describe them to others besides ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, for example, is of the opinion that emotions come from simpler activities in the cortex and body-sense areas of the brainstem, as is Jaak Pankseep, who is more focused on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the emotions that span the species.
Theoretically, I can't deny this, but I think it's unproven.
Pankseep believes that what seems like fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases: How to check if rats and humans feel the same when they behave the same way.
A cockroach escapes danger, does it feel fear too?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not proof of the same experience.
Although neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, but cockroaches don’t have brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proved in relation to humans, how can we prove this in relation to rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I do not know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I’m researching the emotional behavior of rats rather than their emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area promises to be at the neural level, if measured in rats and humans in the same way.
Just as in the case of rats, I do not study language and consciousness, nor do I study emotions, because I do not know if they exist.
This may seem like a short-sighted attitude to others, but I would rather move forward than keep hitting a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: A time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunik said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and a testament to its belief in Ukraine’s ability to organise the European Championship together with Poland,” Vasyunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much work to be done in both countries.”
Both host countries are lagging behind in the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible to reduce the number of European stadiums from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at a high speed now,” said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they decided to take an even more radical step.
After several scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN association, which was replaced by independent commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have confirmed in a letter to UEFA President Michel Platini that this will not adversely affect preparations for the 2012 European Championship."
Only in the last season, several first-league teams had to be ranked in the lower class due to manipulation, and finally the league start had to be postponed.
Annoyed Dennis Quaid is back.
The actress wanted to promote a new film, in an interview she talked about her private life - and now she has a problem with her ex-husband. Meg Ryan, a Hollywood star, declared her ex-husband Dennis Quaid an adulterer.
He who squirms - and strikes back
The War of Late Roses at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid's ex-husband: The two Hollywood actors are fighting an ugly fight seven years after their divorce - in public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan said, “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain.”
It wasn't until after the divorce that Meg found out how many women Dennis had cheated on her.
The psychic stripper took place because of Ryan’s press work on his new film, “Women,” which tells the story of an adulteress.
Dennis Quaid reacted strongly to the outcry of an unfaithful husband: "It's horrible," the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, "that Meg is boringly repeating and recounting the history of our relationship."
In addition, it’s also “unfortunate” that 16-year-old joint boys, Jack, are repeatedly “publicly reminded of the many pains and changes that divorce causes a child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since his divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become the father of a twin.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following page cut: "My life will continue anyway.
I am happy to have a wonderful family where everything is in perfect order.”
Decrease in airfare and hotel room prices
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany were not less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of flights and hotel rooms have once again improved – summarizing the results of a study by American Express, a travel and financial services provider.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter, it noted a significant price drop in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodations have become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
In the period from April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is seen by American Express in the low exchange rate of the dollar, which has led to a "failing travel pleasure for American tourists."
The decline in hotel room prices affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London more than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices have risen by 26.3%, a European record.
There was also an upward trend in airfare prices in the first quarter.
Due to the higher cost of kerosene, passengers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights with high fuel demand increased by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, the prices of economy class flights fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but business and first class prices showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9%, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
The price of domestic flights to Germany has halved, according to the study.
The reason for the drop in prices is, on the one hand, weakening economic growth, the company claims.
Demand has weakened in many segments of the aviation market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises air travel between the US and Europe, increases the competitive pressure.
The tense situation is justified by the cancellation of loss-making flights by airlines, and many airlines have reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe are affected.
HSV beats Gladbach to 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV came to the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a working team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deepfly for national team Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player got into the game late, and his raise bounced back from the goal.
His exact message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled in the hallway leading to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the pause was over, and most of them sat in their seats again.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist at HSV for nearly three decades, gaining more prestige than some former players.
So your request was heard at the appropriate place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and showed his thumb in a consensual way.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg manager Martin Jol.
His command could be similar: Give me the second goal!
The command was not executed.
"Today was not always a beautiful sight," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt also "imagined it more loosely".
The goal score of 1:0 (1:0) was scored by the Hamburgers by the head of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that the very weak Gladbachers were not able to inflict pain on the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol said.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
The viewers celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the screen, which represented their team as the top of the championship class.
It's going to be a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate certificate of the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of the HSV.
Although the team slowly finds itself thanks to its late-committed tracks - Brazil's Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and FC Bayern's Jansen - but it's not brilliance yet.
"We need more senses and trickery," Jol demanded.
After the rejection
Wall Street is filled with fear.
As a result of the first reports of the rescue package’s failure, the Dow Jones temporarily dropped 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in one day in his history.
Later, the Dow got a little stronger.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer was at a good 5 percent minus and stood at 10.579 points.
Technology paper trader Nasdaq dropped more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
Dow’s biggest loss at the time was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by the Bank of America with a 12% loss.
Not a single piece of paper got stronger.
Goldman Sachs bank’s shares fell nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, a stake in the bank was bought by big investor Warren Buffett.
As part of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgages.
However, the amount is not to be paid at the same time, but gradually.
In return, the state would receive stock options vouchers from financial institutions, which could be used if exchange rates evolved properly, reducing the burden on the state treasury.
European and American and Stock Exchange Rates in Descending
The billions in aid to European and American banks do not dispel the doubts of investors.
The share price of the German bank Hypo Real Estate plummets and captivates Dax.
The Dow Jones index is declining despite the state-planned rescue of the financial market.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the German stock index (Dax) to a low level.
Munich’s real estate funder’s stock fell to a quarter despite a rescue effort by the federal government and private banks, with Commerzbank weakening by more than 20 percent.
The Dax plunged below the psychologically important 6,000-point limit and recorded 5839 points with a 3.7 percent minus.
The stock market has fallen on its knees worldwide.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s <0x24>700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, down 3.3 percent to 10.809.25.
The U.S. House of Representatives wants to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote will take place on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges only knew one direction: in London, the FTSE index weakened by 3.2 percent, and in Paris, the CAC 40 lost by 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index declined by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.

Dark matter affects the flight of spacecraft
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The spacecraft "Ulysses" flew in space for nearly 18 years.
He's in danger of frostbite due to the soon freezing fuel lines.
Scientists have been confused for years by a mysterious phenomenon called swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is the gravitational swing manoeuvre of space probes, during which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational space of a celestial body, such as Earth.
This way, the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens probe, like the Ulysses solar probe, also used this physical trick.
But what has amazed researchers for years is that flying objects do not behave in the full way that would be expected under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, there are anomalies in speed.
The probes suddenly accelerate or slow down.
So far, physicists have not found an explanation for this effect.
This is called a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which perceives the mass attraction of matter as a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, continues to believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and attempts to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter discovered by astronauts in the universe.
"The anomaly may be caused by dark matter, which may even be found in the vicinity of the Earth," Adler writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for ten years.
Obviously, it exerts a gravitational force that can be observed to affect other celestial bodies.
However, matter itself is completely invisible, that is, it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists have calculated that a good one-fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt escaped
After spending ten days in captivity, the tourists detained in Egypt are free again, the Italian Foreign Minister said.
The kidnappers in Sudan demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
In the shooting that preceded the release of the hostages, six hostages were reportedly killed.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are already under way.
Over and over again, Germans become the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists deported in the Sahara are free.
This has been reported by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya Arab TV and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: “Our compatriots and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently looking at their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as eight of their Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
Nineteen participants of the desert expedition are reportedly on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shootings before the release of the hostages remain unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the hostages had already shown a willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army unexpectedly killed six of them.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom,” the official said.
"The trial was just about taking the hostages," when suddenly "the surprise occurred."
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two.
The hostages demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily al-Masri al-Jom reported, referring to a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, the hostages release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men are being held by kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"Leaded in suicide" stepfather rape
It was said in court that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had raped her for years.
In Stithians, Cornwall, 57-year-old Michael Trerise was sentenced to six years in prison after confessing to an eight-order attempted sexual assault.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that he had regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
In one of his confessions, Trerise wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 at his home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When he was a child in Coventry, Trerise tied up and blindfolded him before intercourse while his mother worked in a pub.
In the 1980s, Trerise divorced his wife and relocated to Cornwall.
Her granddaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it was revealed that Ms. Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering for the National Trust, was being persecuted by the horrors of twice-weekly violence.
In 2006, Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously been passionate about surfing and cycling, was “emotionally dead” and “forgoing life.”
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, was found dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably suffocated himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle got into a fight with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his confession in a letter saying, "I always tied him up and blindfolded him.
I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You’re an extremely strange fetishist, and I’m sure that was terrible for your victim, especially if she was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim committing suicide.
Even more confusing, however, is the fact that if he had not done so, the case might never have been brought to justice.”
The judge added: “I would like to draw your attention to the impact Stephanie’s parents have had on their daughter over the years.
If it hadn’t happened, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful, and happy young woman.”
An official who lost important data has been charged.
According to the BBC, a government official who left top-secret documents on a train in June has been accused of violating official secrecy.
The man was on an expert mission from the Department of Defense when he left two top-secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the slightest accusation of a violation of the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional misconduct.
According to Frank Gardner, a BBC correspondent for the Department of Defense, the move surprised many at Whitehall.
"They believed that the Department of Defense and the government would treat the case as an internal matter," he said.
An employee who cannot be named has been prosecuted under section 8.1 of the Act. This section is about the retention of information.
The state prosecutor's office suggested that the Metropolitan Police represent the official for his rather sensitive work with the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included classified surveys of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
The decision was announced on Monday, and he was moved from his home to an unknown location.
Housing cooperatives pay the bill for B&amp;B
UK housing cooperatives can expect an account of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government spent <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion on protecting 2.6 million account holders’ deposits with Bradford & Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use depositors’ money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Housing Associations (BSA), it is “annoying” that companies and their members have to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will eventually be repaid after the Bradford & Bingley mortgages have been repaid.
However, interest accruing in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial corporations that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are among them.
It is annoying that the institutions that have already acted prudently ... now have to pay the accounts of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that each company has to pay as much as it owns. The companies share 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan will reach <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to set aside <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the union of housing companies, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
“It is outrageous that institutions that have acted prudently during the boom of the housing market have to pay the bills of the much less cautious institutions.”
According to the BSA, no company has gone bankrupt since it started operating in 1945.
“We need to look at every aspect of this issue in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of bills,” Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 will cover 7 months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
In 2010, one full year’s interest will have to be paid, which could be twice as much as the current one.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help organizations without shareholders, eventually members will have to pay the bill, either at higher fees or at lower interest rates on their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of milk by an additional five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two-pence increase in February and following a survey conducted by an advisory firm.
It is up to resellers to decide whether to pass on the price increase to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Bangladesh MP's request to be released has been rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request for ex-parliamentarian Sheikh Hasina’s release, which means she can be arrested when she returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court refused him to defend himself on the charge of blackmailing a businessman for <0x24>50 million (<0x24>729,700) while he was in parliament.
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges brought against it.
Sheikh Hasina’s old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, is demanding that the country’s military-backed interim government give him full freedom first.
According to reports, although he was released on parole to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear from the conditions of his release whether he can preserve his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
"The Court of Appeals rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request as it was not necessary because she was already temporarily freed and is undergoing treatment abroad," said Rafique-ul Huq, a lawyer.
"We will appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal."
His lawyers argue that he needs to defend himself in prison in order to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
A leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was arrested last year after the military-backed provisional government took over, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the vaccination programme against polio in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been excluded from the recently organized polio vaccination programme due to Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the United Nations organized a vaccination campaign in six provinces.
However, they said they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said this was despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or interfere with the work of thousands of vaccine personnel.
BSkyB's appeal against ITV has been rejected
BskyB’s appeal against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its interest in the rival TV broadcaster ITV was rejected.
The Competition Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission found that BSkyB’s shareholding was an obstacle to competition and a source of unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired its shareholding in 2006, effectively preventing NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from acquiring ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the acquisition of BSkyB’s shareholding in ITV would jeopardise ITV’s independence, prompting the Competition Committee to initiate an investigation.
Virgin director Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups, and Ofcom's supervisors were all opposed to the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV shareholding was an unreasonable and disproportionate compensation, in particular given that BSkyB had stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. Attorneys-General in 2006.
The move was followed by a report by the Chief Justice of the Ministry of Justice on the case criticizing the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators, and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because there was a fear that the state prosecutors would be dismissed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials interviewed during the investigation attempted to obstruct the justice system by lying.
"Serious allegations of a possible crime have not yet been investigated or clarified," Chief Inspector Glenn Fine said.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor with the power to order witnesses to testify.
The series began with the removal of nine U.S. Attorneys-General from office by the U.S. Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, it was said that prosecutors were fired because of their poor performance.
However, it turned out later that the dismissed state prosecutors received no worse assessment than many of their other colleagues, which led many to conclude that political considerations were behind the dismissals.
Some state prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressional members, while others refused to participate in the investigation of accusations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
U.S. Attorneys-General conduct investigations and court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be removed from their position for political reasons.
At the time, the head of the Ministry of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of attacks on the state's Attorney General because of the dismissals, and eventually resigned.
Several other officials of the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In his report, the Inspector General strongly criticized Gonzales' role in the case, saying that the Attorney General was "primaryly responsible" for the dismissals, had "resigned" his role as manager, and had "remarkably withdrawn" himself from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, a former aide to senior Bush, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epic of Meat Loaf
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition at the Q Awards for her epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold award at the London ceremony next week, said he was honored to receive the award.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second track was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year’s awards and was nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is like that."
The song by Jim Steinman required a very big voice, and that voice was Meat Loaf.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental period.
It was released as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" album has been on the charts for almost nine years and has sold more than 40 million copies since then.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, is currently suffering from health problems, including a heart arrhythmia that caused her to undergo surgery in 2003 after she collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to acute laryngitis.
It was later discovered that there was a cyst on his vocal cord.
Unknown metropolitan street that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, and other side roads. Some of them are famous, others serve a mere practical function.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and local residents who have lived here for a long time would find it difficult to tell where to find the Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it before.
The small street is in East Village and is headed north from First Street – without reaching Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long and resembles a dusty alley rather than a main transport route.
There are no street signs.
You can’t find it on a standard map.
However, the street has its admirers.
There, for example, is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
You want to re-cover the Extra Place and make sure you can get to the shops and boutiques of the new buildings on a cleaner road.
Among the street admirers are the long-time neighbors who were caught in the decayed street that it was the only remnant of the area’s history prior to renovations.
However, the owner of the street, the city’s building conservation and development department, has no interest in sticking to it.
This month, at a meeting of the district government’s land management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the city’s management and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, district head of municipal council No. 3.
"There is very little land in the city, and we would like Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
“Proposals for renovation and management may come in handy that Avalon can carry out, but we also want to ensure that it remains accessible to the public.”
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to re-pave the little street and provide it with seating. Some of these would be used by a cafe, to which the builder is expected to rent an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first unveiled at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on owning it.
"The main point of Avalon Bay is to renovate this devastated alley and turn it into a pleasant public place," he said, adding that the city had proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Conservation Office, said the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office’s job was to develop the buildings, not manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, the Extra Place does not have much historical significance.
Some say it was called "no man's land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
The punk-rock monument closed in 2006, the CBGB's rear exit to the Extra Place, and the street is perhaps the most notable for taking a photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes, barrels and posters, and leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class took possession of East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place, arguing that this piece of public property, however modest, must remain in the community.
Others refer to the Extra Place as a rarity, a piece of the city that has remained virtually unchanged and should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog “The Losing New York of Jeremiah” (“The Book of Lamentations: A Bitter Nostalgia for the Extinction of the City”), posted on his blog a portion of the story about Extra Place, which appeared in the “City Rumors” column of the weekly “The New Yorker” in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, dark even during the day, bounded by rusty iron storage doors and spatula windows, and where the wind carries weekly newspapers through the canals."
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street, next to the back door that used to lead to the CBGB, and now belongs to a higher-priced clothing store in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty 0.75-litre beer bottle was lying next to a pile of discarded, fresh paper.
Some passersby have said that they rarely think of the Extra Place, but they think they could use a renovation.
Fields said he thinks some people underestimate his attractiveness in the current state of the street.
"I have spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this part of the Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates’ views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research and senior director of education research, co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice.”
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are also included.
According to Obama’s campaign, “African-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is true.
In order to overcome such performance gaps, Obama’s Education Plan explicitly supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English learners.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on school education in non-English, will outweigh his interest in overcoming the big performance gaps.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep contract primary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The majority of the school’s students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than a third of students - many of whom have recently arrived - are studying English.
Despite this, 100% of fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 State Mathematics Exam.
Equally impressive is that 93% of fourth graders passed the English Language and Literature exam.
This incredible achievement has not been achieved with the instrument that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills and rejection of objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s educational principle is the “full immersion” of English students into the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of the English language in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said: “We’ve had a tremendous success in saying that if someone walked into a classroom, they wouldn’t know who the student was who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months earlier.”
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama set a good example for other schools that teach a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English-learning students, such as Sixth Street Prep?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer clear, but because of the education policy of its own party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and because it is itself consistently advocating bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama’s response.
Although he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently made a dismissive statement when he said that people should not worry so much about the "exclusive Englishness" of the legislation.
Instead, he said, "They should get their children to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to reduce the gap between results, he should seriously study the models that work, instead of contempt and disregard them.
Renewed concerns about the economy have caused oil prices to fall sharply
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that America’s rescue plan for the financial markets will not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil securities fell seven percent to <0x24>99.80 this morning on the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices have fallen by more than <0x24>20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity exchanges have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching <0x24>145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost <0x24>90 per barrel early this month, before falling back under the influence of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, the concern resurrected investors even after congressional leaders announced that they had reached an agreement on an economic rescue operation this weekend, which is the largest in history to date.
The news has been overshadowed by concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for long.
As the crisis unfolds, Citigroup will acquire Wachovia Corporation’s banking business, the government announced on Monday.
In the meantime, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of the desperate weekend talks, “the rescue operation does not seem to have been able to revive the stock market’s trading spirit.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, such as oil, is also expected to decline.
“The future of the stock market, interest rates and currency exchange rates has become uncertain around the world,” an analyst at Deutsche Bank told investors.
"We believe that the commodity market will not be avoided by the 'epidemie'.
The biggest issue for the commodities market is the extent to which the U.S. “disease” is infecting the entire world, especially China.”
As oil consumption declined due to the slowdown in economic growth, bank analysts cut their expectations for next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 20% in 2009.
In the second quarter, the team set a record.
After spending more time in the Jets than anyone else in the last eight seasons, defensive end player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational match.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals’ slack game was brought into full harmony with the dark clouds towering in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave a 12-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles, which was the perfect prelude to an afternoon in which their unfolding collaboration developed significantly.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks in a row fell 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't regret the effort," Favre said of all the passes he gave to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We have been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis caught a bad shot and threw it back with 32 yards, which was a touchdown.
Eric Smith, a safety player, reached into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
That last turn could have been the most amazing moment in the game.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets scored, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting the score to 34:0.
This was the best result the Jets have ever achieved in a quarter.
When Jets coach Eric Mangini was asked to describe the mind-blowing nature of the game, he said, "Second or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Cardinals scored 21 points in the third quarter and the Jets didn't score one - Mangini said: "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third.
We scored a lot of points in a short period of time.”
Gebrselassie breaks its own world record
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider him to be the best mid- and long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday, making him the first to run the 42.2 km in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a comfortable flat finish in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on his previous 2:04:26 result last year in Berlin.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record for his career in such a wide range of fields that he won the World Championships or reached a world record in almost every race from the 1500m to the marathon.
Last month Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing that air pollution would aggravate his asthmatic problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin Marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny weather, initially at 9<0xC2><0xB0>C and finally at 13<0xC2><0xB0>C - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, at an incredible speed of 2 minutes and 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since non-marathon runners such as Gebrselassie and the Kenyan Paul Tergat turned to longer distances, the marathon record has declined by more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 1998 with a 2:06:05 result.
After the victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago, he had a spasm in his two legs and was unable to train for two weeks.
Clearly, during the forced rest, he was refreshed and not rusted.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"It all worked out perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had my doubts, but in the end everything was fine.”
He has received some criticism, especially from Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival, that he uses too many assists in his races, usually avoids many world-famous marathon runners, relies on his speed runners as if he were running on tracks, and puts world records ahead of the spirit of competition.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes Gebrselassie’s magnificence in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie reached the midpoint on Sunday with four Kenyan speed runners in 1:02:04.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave Gebrselassie the rhythm after the speed runners got tired.
Just over 4.8km ahead of the finish Gebrselassie beat Kwambai in one final sprint, finishing second with 2:05:36, improving his individual best by 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
Irina Mikitenko, who was born in Kazakhstan and is now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with her 7th fastest win, 2:19:19.
The world record is held by Paula Radcliffe with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon with a surprise 2:24:14.
He was not able to participate in the Beijing Olympics due to his alleged back injury, but was quickly healed and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved by five minutes at his individual peak. This was the third marathon distance race he participated in.
He won the race with a clever calculation: first he allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership, then he pursued them after running about 30 km.
The Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with a time of 2:21.31, while the Kenyan Helena Kiprop finished third with a time of 2:25:01.
A Separate City, the Pride and Trials of Blacks
In the Greater Orlando amusement park, a few miles away from everything that glitters, is loud and powerful, hides a quiet small town where the pride and complications of the African-American life experience were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to be integrated into the country and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as he described it in 1935: "The five lakes, three croquettes, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava and two school towns, without prison."
It's now a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have attended the annual Zora Festival, a series of celebrations held in Eetonville in honor of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that he described and made a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida Guidebook published by the Crisis Federal Writers Project, is separate from its surroundings.
It is as independent, dignified, and self-contained as it was in the 1930s, when, according to Hurston, city blacks in Florida were often reluctant to share their true thoughts with white people who “know so little about us that they don’t know what they’re missing.”
Even in the year that the black presidential candidate Barack Obama encouraged an open exchange of views on the racial issue, many here are distrustful of the outsider’s gaze.
“We are very careful how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here all his life and is a member of the city’s oldest church.
"You have to tell it right."
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of black standing, and at the same time a community of almost 2,400 people, where the poverty rates are double the national average.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example of the sometimes despised, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture that flourishes in the shade of oak trees, as a result of American slavery.
It is not surprising, then, that the people here are proud and defensive at the same time.
The image of Eatonville has been important since Zora (here everyone calls Hurston that).
In books written in an honest, strong dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937), he introduced his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida guidebook transformed the city, which lies next to Route 17, a road that leads from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was as brave as the drums in life and literature, introduced his readers to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then looked into more intimate spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road we find the modern public school, on a brown background with a white border, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller tends, though he can hardly read and write."
She mentioned the widow Dash's new husband, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything you might need in the temporary accommodation."
In a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with autonomy, but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Clearly, the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description didn’t really please everyone.
"Zora told things the way they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls, who was immortalized by Hurston by quoting the slick songs men sang about their beauty.
He added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered here as the living eccentric who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a roaring Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes and wearing long pants to a city where people are still proud of their dignified dress.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were foreshadowed.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, swinging in his chair, "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were not republished.
Along with most of the world, it seemed that Eatonville had forgotten about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in an unmarked tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he used to live.
There were no major commemorations or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how much it enriched the world or what it left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's biography, "Wrapped in a Rainbow," published in 2003.
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of the two-lane main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in community life.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the state-bound Interstate 4 highway on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering after a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, racially mixed struggles brought hatred to the community.
"At that time, a group of white boys came over and threw oranges and other things at those on the side of the road," Franklin said.
"There was a woman who died in this.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to impose forced integration, stating that "the Brown v. Board of Education decision is more offensive than respectful of my race."
Today, residents say that although the de-segregation of schools was positive in some respects, it weakened the cohesion of the people of Eetonville and undermined the self-confidence of young people.
“Black children are accustomed to being hugged—I remember that—the man hugged his teacher both in the morning and in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, executive director of a nonprofit organization called “Let’s Keep the Eatonville Community.”
"This lasted as long as students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
“We didn’t hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher – I mean, there were cultural differences between us,” Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurstons rise—black writers, actors, and artists who have transcended prejudice, as she has done, with such optimistic self-confidence and lines as, “How can anyone deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company?
This is incomprehensible to me.”
In 1975, Alice Walker pilgrimed to Hurston's unmarked tomb and began to struggle to restore her reputation.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed biography of Hurston, written by Robert E. Hemenway, was placed on the shelves of bookstores, and was once again a role model for America.
The road construction project was about to begin when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
The community started organizing a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the county would ruin with its main road.
Thousands of fans have come to the opening event two years later, and many have since returned to the ceremony every January.
Several years later, the county withdrew from its road construction proposal.
"With the five-lane highway, the community has been revived at full speed, which is a real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said, “Zora saved Eatonville.”
The victory over the road construction project helped change the city’s image of itself.
Increasing numbers of people living outside the city, such as lawyer Rachelle Munson, who started attending church here in 1993, began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Historic List in 1998.
In 2006, a new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened on Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remains Florida's cuckoo-egg: less than ten kilometers from downtown Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban side street during summer rain; as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Ninety percent of the population is black.)
They still receive with caution outsiders who come here in search of the story of Eatonville.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things — such as Eatonville’s oldest fresco, painted by a white man and depicting blacks working in the fields — are not allowed to be photographed.
Many people in Eatonville, including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to bright red, fear that their separate community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival expanded, the pride of the hometown grew.
Young people, in particular, increasingly view Eatonville as the way Hurston saw his race: wonderful, with all its problems and everything, neither better, nor worse, as proud, as creative, as diligent, as foolish, and as confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
A sincere civic affection comes from the words of Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after graduating from college to work for a local government or police station that he thinks needs help.
And it seems the younger ones have also learned to correctly describe Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just travel through here think this city is nothing compared to the rest," said Alondra Kenon recently after the service on Sunday.
"But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know his history, then this is a very beautiful city."
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn’t care about the newsstands and the huge TV projectors on Times Square, they wouldn’t notice they’re in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with the glass-walled, beehive-shaped offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who hold New York in their power have been living the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers are still beating their metal tea carts down the sidewalks, carrying trays filled with muffins for morning meetings.
Still, Spanish-speaking men roam the blocks, carrying like a human mule fifty pairs of ironed shirts hanging on a yoke-like loop over their shoulders.
Office workers are still queuing for their breakfast sweet pastries at the food carts on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi on weekdays between 4 and 7 p.m.
I didn’t feel like there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the bad news, I decided to open a new bank account.
Although I had deliberately planned to take care of it during the afternoon rest in the local branch of my JP Morgan Chase bank, there were already about 20 people in the queue.
Not at the cashier’s window, where money can be withdrawn or deposited, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy’s store, and where new customers open bank accounts.
Many before me, I found out later from Starr, the banker "ordered me," were lined up with the same intentions as I had.
However, unlike me, they have already withdrawn their money from smaller banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (which are like housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate only in one state and allegedly treat their clients as family members.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with <0x24>327 billion in capital, has been placed in bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers left for the weekend on Friday, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a bank rescuer with <0x24>440 billion in savings.
The office and shop workers in front of me, fearing another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, the bank that makes the most capital injection buyouts on Wall Street.
The simple people of New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman at a local Chinese store spoke on her phone about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and her huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor of my apartment block, in his fifties, changed the subject, not about Brad and Angelina or my food shipment, as usual.
After going to the bank, he said to me, “I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim tombs desecrated while Austria tilted to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to introduce the organization "Cities Against the Conquest of Islam".
They marched with signs imitating traffic signs depicting mosques crossed by red lines.
According to police, far-right extremists are responsible for the desecration of Muslim cemeteries in Austria on the same weekend when far-right parties made significant advances in national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged in the Traun cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators used paint sprays to draw Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some graves, but investigators said they were just trying to hide their extreme motives, which stem from hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shaken” by the grave-shaming that took place shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscience test following yesterday’s parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance has tilted to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, a strong anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were labeled xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Freedom Party, which won more than 18% of the vote, expressed his displeasure at the campaign against headscarves and shells, as well as his disapproval of food allegedly associated with Islam.
At the party’s final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” that would prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
According to opinion polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election that brought the far-right victory, the change was due to a largely young voting base who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter banned from traveling abroad
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of raping children, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges ruled on Glitter’s six-month ban after informing the authorities that controlled him of his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police have obtained a travel ban on Thursday after submitting evidence of convictions for child rape against Glitter to the court.
Glitter, whose real name was Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Magistrates' trial in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25, Kent police filed a petition with the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain on March 25.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter has informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because he is obliged to do so by the law on persons in the register of sexual offenders.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You are also required to notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years in prison.
Kent police said they didn't want to talk about Glitter County's individual cases and possible whereabouts.
A Kent police spokesman said: “The Kent police are doing everything they can to protect children both within the country and abroad.
“We think it’s easier to control someone if they don’t leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system to manage potential risks more effectively.
"Kent Police considers the most important task to be to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behavior of persons who have been registered as sexual offenders and who live in the county, in order to minimize any potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10-year-old and an 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The local authorities refused to let him pass the passport check, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where officials of the provincial police and immigration office insisted on returning to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on August 22, and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Court in West London because, as requested by Scotland Yard, he was entered on the register of sexual offenders under a court order.
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the UK in 1999 for possession of photographs of rape of children.
According to a Ministry of the Interior source, Jacqui Smith, State Secretary for Home Affairs, was reassured and delighted that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
“I don’t take pictures on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal point of view.” – Günther Bauer
No set, no frills, no dance shoes.
The grandmasters of flamenco are close by, without the excitement of the performance: so that we can get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
Ordinary people, on the other hand.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in intimate moments away from the audience, when one can glimpse at a personal gesture, grasp the depth of a caught gaze, or marvel at the beauty of the inactive but expressive hand of the artist who is about to perform outside the stage.
The German photographer Günther Bauer combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known everyday side of the masters in his photo series Flamenco-people.
Through the photos, he presents the distinctive iconography of flamenco from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco’s Photography Month, “reflects the increasing international importance of flamenco every day,” the author says, adding that the Flamenco-people “could be anyone, as the viewer realizes that these images do not represent the artists in a typical way.
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and captivate the audience.
Stage photography, however, is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character reside in the depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco grandparents with the help of a camera.”
With the impetus of the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer embarked on his long journey in 1997, taking portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers using a disc camera.
These portraits evoke classic photography thanks to the camera and theme selection.
However, the application of different stylistic tools breaks with traditional visual representations and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "This is music with traditional roots, but it changes from day to day and is always fascinating."
Not the dance, not the singing or the music itself, but rather the personality and character of the artist enchant the audience.
The guiding motif of the works that can be viewed in the gallery of El P<0xC3><0xB3>toma is the search for the encounter with the essential, the artistic vaas, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and presentation.
Famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo are the hallmarks of this photo collection featuring almost 60 artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, which will soon include an album featuring the portraits presented at the exhibition.
Two years ago Bauer’s passion for portraits prompted him to repeat the idea with the series “Portraits of veteran athletes” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different, the photographer adds: "I really like to photograph people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is portrait.
You meet people, you meet people you don’t even know, or people who only take a few minutes to take photos.
But in spite of these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
The exhibition Flamenco-people, selected from the portraits of contemporary flamenco, can be seen in the El Photomata Gallery at the Alameda de Hércules parallel calle de la Mata 20 until 16 October.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel he is working on is "ready reckless."
The location and the plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on writing his new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Casemant, who lived in the Congo for 20 years and also traveled the Amazon.
At the Hay Festival Segovia, the Nobel Prize-winning author admitted yesterday that his current work is “ready-to-be reckless” and “all indications that the novel should not be written.”
“If I were smarter, I wouldn’t do it, but I’ll do it, and I hope I can finish it sometime,” he said at the Aqueduct Festival of Exchange of Ideas, Thoughts, and Journalists, which hosted hundreds of writers, historians, and thousands of visitors for four days.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the festival of literature, and he fulfilled his hopes.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award, an old edition of Dickens’s novel “Our Common Friend”. His performance filled the Juan Bravo theatre.
He was greeted by a devoted audience after the greeting of Félix Romeo. The audience soon lost the lesson, during which the Peruvian writer, with amazing memory and a great deal of humor, told how his vocation as a writer emerged from the special adventure of his passion for reading and the desire to live life; how he rebuilt the lack of inspiration with the help of disciplined writing methods, with the help of many methods of writing.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it is impossible to measure or show whether books can change our lives, but added, “I don’t think literature is a mere entertainment or a blooming experience” because it influences people and makes them think, so he urged writers not to give in to the temptation of lightness and to be held accountable for their vocation.
Pozoblanco farewell is shorter due to harsh weather, horseback bullfights are also cancelled
Traditionally held as the closing accord of the Pozoblanco holidays, the bullfight on horseback was cancelled yesterday morning after prospective riders found the arena unfit for battle.
As a result, the committee decided, with the agreement of Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, to refrain from the bullfight.
The ceremonies were severely disrupted by the weather conditions, as two of the three events could not be held.
The second bullfight was cancelled on Saturday because of the rain.
The prospective protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista would have fought the bulls of Castilblanco.
So they only had a bullfight on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took home three ears as a trophy. After a refined and aesthetic fight, he was carried around on his shoulders.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante won numerous accolades and trophies for his two bulls, but this was due to the audience rather than his own performance.
After this, however, El Juli made little contribution to the renown of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable run with the second bull, we managed to get most of the audience out of the spiral.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, a two tonne hashish van tried to escape roadside inspection
Four o'clock in the morning, fifty minutes.
The Basque Regional Police conducts traffic checks in the administrative area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (Alava).
The authorities stop a van in which two passengers are travelling. The passengers try to escape the action.
The shipment, more than two tons of hashish, was not conspicuous at the same time.
Investigators pursued the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A. A. J., the Basque government's Home Affairs Department said.
The man is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident took place in the administrative district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n, where the traffic inspectors of <0xC3><0x81>lava carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the inspection site.
Investigators chased him, and the vehicle stopped a few kilometres off the stop lane, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police eventually captured one of them and, after inspecting the Iveco Daily branded van, seized its shipment of 2,178 kilograms of hashish.
The hashballs that filled the rear of the vehicle were transported by police to carry out a thorough investigation and weigh the drug.
In addition, the inspection revealed that the vehicle’s false license plate does not match the information contained in the van’s papers, so the arrested person is also prosecuted for forgery of public documents.
The Basque Regional Police continues the investigation, the purpose of which is, on the one hand, to arrest the other suspect, who, as already mentioned, escaped from the highway, and, on the other hand, to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A. A. J., was taken to the police for the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours, court action began.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend by police in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of medication.
One eyewitness said he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange manoeuvres, a spokesman for California's Traffic Control told People magazine.
According to the eyewitness, Locklear "did push the gas to the floor, roared the engine, tried to leave the parking lot forwards and backwards, and passed through his sunglasses several times in reverse."
Soon after, the witness, who at first probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he was "concerned about Locklear's life".
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed traffic on the highway.
"It looked messy," so the patrolmen took him to a drug and alcohol testing center.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was almost immediately ruled out. The spokesperson also said that the officers’ first impression was that she was thought to be under the influence of Locklear’s drug.
Locklear was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug. He was transferred to a local prison around 7 p.m., where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of a sanatorium in Arizona two months ago, where his anxiety and depression were treated.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian federation of the IU (United Left) to take action on the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the Secretary General of the IU and a representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federation of the corps will make a decision on the case of Francisco Manuel Silva, former Youth and Sport Counsellor of the Seville Municipality.
"In these matters I am a far-reaching federalist, and this matter certainly falls within the competence of the Andalusian organization," Llamazares pointed out the procedure which the party must apply to the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that when detecting possible irregularities committed by Silva, "transparency" should be kept in mind: "The IU has always advocated for maximum transparency in matters of this kind."
He added that part of the training is "a strict code of ethics for civil servants."
"May Blood", an epic creation by Garci
Benito Pérez’s National Episodes of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s inspired José Luis Garci, who evokes the famous anti-French uprising of the Spaniards in the blood of May, which, with a budget of nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million, is the greatest work of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the influx of people and social analysis he had always admired in the well-known novelist’s work. Today at the film premiere, Garci told the audience of the actors together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a.
More than two and a half hours of May Blood will be shown in cinemas on Friday, and later Telemadrid will be screened as a miniseries in a length of more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’s literature, made his childhood dream come true with this filming. He owes all this to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him from the Province of Madrid three years ago to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the events of May 2nd in Madrid. Garci accepted the invitation on the condition that the basis of the story E
The <0x24>15 million budget was entirely financed by the Autonomous Province of Madrid and gave Garci a special opportunity: he was able to present “the confused Spaniards, who mistakenly sided with the wrong leader, because the struggle for independence pushed the country into a huge backwardness with the reign of Ferdinand VII,” he said.
However, the director regretted that he could not count on the budget of the phantoms of Alatriste or Goya, who had more than doubled the May blood, and was forced to omit some scenes from the script, which, as on many other occasions, is recorded with Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcell Horacio.
So the director of Restart used his usual way of working, recording scenes with the actors he started rehearsing with before the shooting. Casting wasn't because Garci thinks it's "degrading," and because, as he said, "it's part of the art of directing to go to the theater and the cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we're working in."
Several May Blood actors, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga and Fernando Guillen Cuervo, were not the first to step in front of their cameras.
Garci, who has four Oscar nominations and an Academy Award, believes that this year’s nominees for Spain before the Hollywood Academy, i.e. the Blood of May, the Seven French Billiard Tables and the Blind Sunflowers, do not represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, he said.
Garci doesn't expect any awards with this movie.
“At first, you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize that success is all that counts, and then you’re happy to have another movie made,” Garci says after 30 years of professional life.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recalls the life and art of the Sevilla dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville commemorates a dancer from Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her parents when she was three years old.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Oriental dance.
Throughout his busy life, he fought for women's equality as a pioneer, whether it was Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against wearing corsets that impeded women’s freedom of movement.
He sparked a dance and aesthetic revolution in wartime Europe, and his life dazzled Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, he recommended Toortola to my attention, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: “Our goal is not to tell his life story, but to capture his spirit.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, "butterfly dance" for guajira, or "snake dance" for tango.
"She danced sensibly, and others say it's my style," she says.
The light of the performance is elevated by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda, who now sings at Isabel’s performance after Open Doors; and Matilde Coral, who in this case exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde plays the older Toortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the invitation, I'm very honored to have you perform in my play."
In addition, music directors and guitarists Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, singers Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n, drummer El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, viola viola viola, and actor Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, who "plays a permanent character constantly besieging the real diva with his love."
The play also largely depicts the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels across Europe and travels to even remote regions at the time, including India, the United States and Italy.
"The reason I wanted to give him a memorial was because his personality had a huge impact on his own age, but today his work is no longer known and even less appreciated," Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n said.
The performance starts tonight at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, "The Diary of a Newly Married Poet" will also appear.
The first illustrated edition of The Diary of a Newly Married Poet will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church in New York City, where in May 1916 Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia. The presentation is part of a series of programs titled Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Triennium (2006-2008) awarded on the occasion of their five-year anniversary of the Andalusian Regional Government's Nobel Prize for Literature.
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Triennium will conclude with the re-release of this work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet’s memorial house and the travelling exhibition “Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: The Bright Poplar”.
The Cultural Commission of the Andalusian Regional Government has obtained a total of eight hundred copies of the diary of a newly married poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the fame and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America isn’t that attractive.
“God sometimes makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that.”
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman in the film Victims of Sensation, and reflects the shock and inertia caused by Newman’s death in the American cinema industry and throughout America.
How hard it was for him to win the Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
He was known to be sick,
But even so, everyone was shocked by his death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put our feelings into words, and now I've lost a good friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "being better has made my life and this country better."
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or exaggerated.
One of the heroes of cinema and homeland passed through a particularly dark period overshadowed by fear of terrorism and market conditions, American self-esteem and a desperate search for dignity.
When times are difficult and many people lose their virtues easily and there are very few people left to look up to, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of men, it was a real embodiment of the Platonic idea of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won cases, ranging from the anti-drug foundation in memory of his first-born son who died of a drug overdose to the creation of his homemade organic food brand.
It was a real gift for a country that struggled to overcome its suicidal eating culture.
The overwhelming wave of admiration travelled all over Hollywood, regardless of nationality or descent.
According to the last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, it was not a man who died, but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said his collaboration with Newman was clearly the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe, a bad guy from Australia, called Newman his greatest inspiration.
“He’s set the bar very high for all of us,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few people who are trying to follow Paul Newman’s way of life today: they demand honesty and serious privacy away from cameras.
This is not always easy, if at all possible, in the midst of today’s media jungle.
Still, there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his role model.
Once divorced, he was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, although he would have had many opportunities for infidelity.
“Why should I have a hamburger at home when I have roast meat at home?” he joked.
He can be proud in heaven that his daughters are also fans on earth, which is not very common in America.
“Of all his performances, he was not as proud of his role as a faithful husband, loving father, caring grandfather, and devoted philanthropist.”
The Rugged Way of the Olympics in Madrid
Indeed, many of us dream of an Olympic Games in Madrid, and after the failure of 2012, it could become 2016.
But, I ask, are we really ready for it?
Because if we start from yesterday's race, I don't think so at all.
It was called the perfect race, but in my opinion, it was the worst of all the races I’ve ever had.
It was characterized by an abundance of nonsense, and once it had to be evaluated and I was the examiner, the result would clearly be a failure.
But let's move on and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the receipt of the serial number, because it had to arrive earlier.
This in itself is not a problem, but if you are going sooner, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid standing in a later line).
Well, that's not what happened.
At first I was given only the serial number (first nonsense, just to go there sooner) and (after standing in the usual line), how surprising, it was only an S-shirt (second nonsense, because I have a size XL)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, did they decide to save on the material and only buy cheaper, small-sized T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still dwarfed by what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that we had to go there very early to pick up the chip, the queue took 15 minutes from the arrival, and we even had to drop the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in a race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we didn't give up the backpack, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the wait of more than 40 minutes even more pleasant, which was filled with attempts at popular uprisings and stand-offs.
I think we'll have about 500 people with pneumonia tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, won't get our place in time, because I assume my chip recorded the start wrong.
If you asked me about the perfect race, I wouldn’t think about it.
So I think we can continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of -- not very intelligent -- artificial intelligence that can, however, perform some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle in the company's territory) based on the information heard from the conversation.
This "receptionist" can use a camera and a form and facial recognition system to recognize the number of people in the room, who they are -- and even the clothes they wear -- and to hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group attendees based on conversations.
In the presentation video, the receptionist identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company that is talking to her, nor is she an employee of the company.
He asks if he has come to see someone and assures them that he will come to their aid soon.
All without the blue screen.
Fascinating.
This is, of course, the music of the future.
Nowadays, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of people are saying that Microsoft is changing strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and have fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were running only the programs that were needed instead of all the commercial trash, the machines would be five times faster – bravo, Steve, that’s something.
They invented the Spanish wax, considering that Microsoft has added extra features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of direction pays off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is falling into the background, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I joined the theory that Google had taken the first step to become a competitor of Windows.
Many people rightly recognize that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element for the dialogue between hardware and software.
You have the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to count on the "death" of the operating system, not in the absolute, but in the relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
We turn on the computer only to open Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and spend more time browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What are most of the applications that come with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
Windows 7 is much, much less than Vista.
Less cumbersome, less burdened, less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services on-line and ultimately be an alternative to Google.
You need it all, and I’ll give you an example of why.
I took this photo early this month in a Microsoft employee lounge in Redmond.
On the soda machine, a poster tells them to use the company's browser, "Your browser, our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the web.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2010.
Microsoft is set to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, mobile phones increasingly function as computers.
But the slippage, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely spoil their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
It was worn by Pablo Picasso on the Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio in Edward Zwick's Bloody Diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford's Coppola's Godfather, as well as one of the basic costumes of a throbbing gay audience.
And speaking of the list of specialties, we can also recall the peaceful figure of the circus’s mustache lifter.
But what are we talking about? Nothing more than the - typically tight and sleeveless - men's cotton jersey.
In other words, the tank, as the Angolese call it, but none of its competitors can compete with the le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles.
First of all, because of its elegant name, although it is only referred to as "Marcel" among friends, which is due to the sport, according to legend, it is named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel stands out from the competition due to its excellent cotton material, unisex cut, distinctive emblem and the small (rarely recognisable) Belgian flag. The latter is carried by the most distinctive models hidden in the neckline of the T-shirt.
But the Belgian company doesn’t just make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, woolen trousers, t-shirts for sailors, baby clothes, mini-sorts - and even more - are all part of the company's products.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
Although it is also a pity that they have to be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I want to be a young mother; it doesn't matter who the father is."
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he has succeeded in achieving himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
Currently, the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the world of fashion.
For Monica, modeling means much more than just giving some pretty and beautiful girls a name for something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango’s new headquarters in Paris, as well as at the presentation of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It gives you warmth and gentleness.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We present Mango’s new autumn-winter collection, which was designed with my brother Penélope. In addition, we participate in the announcement of the second competition of the ‘Mango Fashion Awards’ and the gala dinner in honour of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a pretty busy day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango. Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; from there we have taken a lot of things.
And then I go around the city and watch the women, how they dress, how they change and choose their clothes - this is one of my favorite pastimes.
You work as a dancer, an actress, and a fashion designer.
I think so too, but in the end these three things are linked, because they have a lot in common.
Even when I was little, I was interested in clothes, and I couldn’t wait to go to my grandmother’s and search her closets.
Well, that was you in Canaan, almost worth an amusement park.
And as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my clothes.
You know, we dancers like to invent our own style for classes and rehearsals to make us feel good when we look in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected, and I have every respect for the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday, didn't you get lethargy?
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I love my 30s.
I think women are really worth it by this time, they've had enough experience, and they've made fewer mistakes in life.
The biological clock doesn’t worry me.
Since I was a child, I have been doing what I want to do, and that gives me great inner happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and in fact, I want to be a young mother, and I don’t want to miss this.
As for the future father, it doesn't matter who he is.
I would like to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's say a few words about the movie. Last year, you made several movies that haven't even been shown yet.
Yes, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theatre, am very impatient and restless, I want everything right away, but of course I know that it is impossible.
I can't wait to be shown The Last Hour and the search for Christ's tomb.
I wonder what you think of them...
I understand you made your runway debut a few days ago with Naomi Campbell.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go on the runway as a model.
I have known Naomi Campbell for a long time and she simply invited me to a charitable fashion show in London for her own Women for a Better World organization. I chose two Mango collections of my own. The presented clothes were auctioned off and the money was donated to Naomi’s NGO.
People don't even know how kind Naomi is.
There's so much going on about it, and I know it, and I assure you, half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of his work.
He hired me for the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'd do that.
If the fate of women in the Third World is at stake, I don't know the impossible.
Recurrent drunk drivers will be forced to install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior would require drivers to install a device that would prevent them from starting the vehicle if the driver was drunk or not blowing into the device.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which the pilot project will last for one year.
As the goal of the project is to restore traffic, the driver will also have to take a repeat course on traffic education.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor’s Office for Traffic Safety, the General Directorate for Transport (DGT) and the Institute of Car Safety Technology Foundation (FITSA) are also participating in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of drivers arrested several times for drunk driving are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, because the system connected to the vehicle detects the alcohol level of the air in which it is inhaled. If it is higher than permitted, or if the driver did not inhale at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 would be borne by the offender.
A 2007 U.S. study showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of violations by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure focuses on violations for two reasons: on the one hand, it makes it easier to prevent them from becoming a criminal offence,
on the other hand, it is easier to implement, as the legal reform is being implemented in the usual way, while the necessary criminal justice reform would require a constitutional amendment.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in experimental mode in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which, following the French model, calls for the system to be incorporated into school buses.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
In English, at 17:40 a.m., the Spanish Air Force landed at the Presidential Hangar of Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport in Mexico City, carrying the Princely Party of Asturias.
The sun was already setting, but it was still so hot that we could only see the royal couple coming out of the plane using our hands as a blindfold.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other distinguished personalities.
A few hours before, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Prince and Duchess were coming to town for an official visit.
- Great, so there won't be an airport shuttle for a while.
- No, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, I mean...
But the Mexican press knows everything about the Princely Couple of Asturias and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting on the red carpet of the airport hangar, a cordon made up of 27 sailors who protect the dignitaries.
The Prince appears, smiling, in a sea blue dress, and then the Princess, with her long hair caught in the wind, in modest clothing, but not in the usual toe-blinking shoes - perhaps they warned that Mexico City was in danger of a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile at the cameras, then enter the room, where the official reception follows.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the city’s four largest hotels, a mexican television spokeswoman awaits them.
The Most Valuable Fashion Award
Paris is undoubtedly the most suitable place in the world for the award of a fashion award, and of today’s living fashion designers, Valentino is undoubtedly the most sophisticated and the coolest.
Mango recently announced the second competition of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to promote young talents in the fashion industry internationally.
The main prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, the Belgian winner of the first competition, Sandrina Fasoli, saw her own clothes in the shop window of Mango at the boulevard Haussmann 54 in Paris, and she was almost tearful.
By the way, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has recently opened on 1,335 square meters.
The largest store is in London.
In the midst of a series of events and thanks to Valentino for presiding over the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagals, Mango’s presidential table for the gala dinner was even more spectacular.
Nati, who came with a heavy heart and sadness because of her brother’s recent death, wore a piece of the Company and some of the breathtaking adornments of ELAH. She accompanied Valentine to the main table of the dinner in his honor, along with his nearly two-meter-tall son Luis.
Andik, the owner and host of the Mango, entertained the guests. Together with Baron Rotchil, they were so chivalrous that they were left without suits, as they had each given them to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own design trousers and shirts, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. During the night’s opera visit, Gaya Toledo became so enthralled in the ballet room that, recalling the old days, she hovered over one of the poles and improvised a grand plie.
Inés Sastre did not attend the visit to the palace, but before that he showed me some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Oliver Martinez - he will be two meters tall and will be riding on a motorcycle - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, bringing his own sheets and towels, and he had told us in advance that he would not ask for any fragrance in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh l<0xC3><0xA0> l<0xC3><0xA0>, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress-relieving number
Not a thousand, but a thousand and a way to turn off from chaotic and messy everyday life.
Another good news is that you can find them all in one book that arrives in the bookstores on September 30th to bring you peace of mind.
It’s almost tortured to hear the clock ring at 7:00 a.m., but it’s even worse to think about how fast-paced the world of today is forcing you to live every day.
The name of the office is tension, and the name of the computer is back pain.
Stress is the disease of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two ways of overcoming daily fatigue and overcoming problems at work.
No, that number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book, so that everyone can find a solution that is tailored to their favorite and free moments.
The stress-relieving work is called the 1001 Relaxation Method, and the tranquility from it comes from the Pearson Alhambra y DK publishing house to the bookstores.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this handbook will certainly shake your faith.
In addition, it also offers other ideas that help you relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to prepare 100% natural food.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and stress has become a central problem in your life, it’s time to sit back in the chair, relax and focus on reading.
People who talk in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I am not talking about those who wake up and are fully alert about what happened to them that day, but about those who talk while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but in fact it is completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure more of them have been told he was talking last night.
In terms of its frequency, it can be completely rapsodic (for example, it occurs only once in a high-fever illness) or more regular (once a day, a week, or a month), and usually the child does not remember anything the next day.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single cause.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night waking, bedtime urination (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not legal.
As already mentioned, a high fever condition, or even a stressful situation, or an increased state of excitement, can be an accompanying phenomenon.
In any case, it has not been studied so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be quiet, calm, composed of incoherent words, or murmur, but in contrast, it may also take the form of shouting, crying, or prolonged speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist. The examination may reveal whether there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety, and thus may offer a solution.
As mentioned above, it is a benign phenomenon and therefore there is no cure unless it is associated with another form of sleep disorder that can be treated (such as insomnia or stress).
However, there are a few things you can do, here is a bouquet of preventive measures:
Make sure your child is calm before going to bed.
Choose reassuring games and avoid watching fear-inducing or more aggressive TV shows or series.
Children who are nervous or have difficulty relaxing will be taught a few relaxation methods to help them find inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep more peacefully.
If you start talking while you sleep, try to stay calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Useful advice
Do not wake the child.
It would be unnecessary, because the child is unconscious, but would fall out of sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually keeps sleeping and resting.
Remember, if the phenomenon is accompanied by severe anxiety several times, it is recommended to consult a specialist or to find out what provokes a high degree of anxiety in the child.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), do not start asking questions to find out anything from him.
It would be superfluous anyway, because when you sleep, you are not conscious enough to gather your thoughts.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but do not see the associated dream images, so be careful with the interpretation of what you have heard and any conclusions you may have.
Never tell a child that they can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, as it is only a few minutes of harmless episode.
Illhaeusern at last
After a long low-fly, the Illhaeusern team finally took a new impetus and won again at home.
Although it wasn’t a hot match, the yellow-blacks were in a lot of situations, and they were able to use one to win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers found it difficult to feel the right rhythm.
The first shot at the gate was attempted by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the distant ball had just touched the upper corner of the goal. After that the Illhaeusern prevailed, and the shots followed one after another: Fonderflick tried to shoot from a distance, and then the shot of Hirn went over the goal.
On the other side, the players defended in a block in the midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi was in a shooting position.
The start of the second half was crucial: first Riahi and Temporale were placed on the side of Dannemarie. Immediately after that, the first goal was scored: Marais from Ilhaeusern scored the ball after Diebold's first shot, and then made it to the goal (53. minute).
The Illhausern goal scorer, however, did not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue the fight at a disadvantage.
Thenmarie, however, could not take advantage of the advantage: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who had just pulled back a little to strengthen their defenses. Only the last few seconds kept some excitement when the ball came very close to the goal.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, the fishermen’s demonstration paralyzed the traffic in several Breton and Norman ports, so the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Tuesday morning to meet with demonstrators’ representatives.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with "concrete proposals".
The presidential visit coincides with a meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the rise in the price of diesel oil, which has surpassed the record average price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.14 per litre.
Speaker David Martinon said the president would "negotiate with fishermen how to help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers."
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, demonstrators in the counties of Morbihan and Calvados held traffic deceleration demonstrations, causing congestion nearly 10 km long.
They also paralyzed the traffic at Quiberon's marina, but the roads to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le were not blocked.
There are roadblocks on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors had already demonstrated their determination, and at dawn they set fire to tires and pallets in front of the fuel warehouses in Brest ports, while demonstrations were taking place in both Concerteau and Saint-Brieuc.
For example, in Sables d'Olonne, Vendée, fishermen did not embark, while in Le Havre, about twenty ships obstructed the traffic of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique department, lifted the blockade of the massive Total oil refinery in the Donges in the evening.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer, on the other hand, have decided to wait for a meeting in the ministry on Wednesday to decide on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to decide on its next move and participation in a meeting planned at the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on Tuesday.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Commission, which did not support their efforts.
“The strike continues,” said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Commission, “because fishermen refuse to accept their demands and refuse to travel to Paris.”
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but believe that a ship would only be profitable if the price of diesel fell below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The Amazing Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid died of cancer at the age of 83 at her home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also paid homage to Paul Newman, a film legend who died at the age of 83.
Embraer will not change its 2008 delivery plans
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, can keep up with the plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company has great confidence in the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120-seater aircraft.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, an insurance company set up by the U.S. financial authorities, intends to sell more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay <0x24>85 billion in advance, according to the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
In addition to life insurance and U.S. pension insurance at an international level, AIG would divest most of its other businesses, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
According to the Times, the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of the sale.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets to be sold by AIG include the company’s aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, a final decision on the sale has not yet been made.
AIG needs to get liquid assets quickly to repay the <0x24>85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government, risking having to divest up to 80% of its capital and losing its shareholders in the same proportion.
Paris Historique Study of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (an unprecedented drop of nearly 800 points) and the Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) dropped 777.68 points to 10 365.45.
The biggest drop in the index (684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, when trading resumed after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001.
Based mainly on technology papers, the Nasdaq closed with a drop of 199.61 points at 1 983.73 points, while the Standard & Poor's 500's expanded index dropped by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points, according to official closing data.
The Wall Street stock market was weakening at the time of its opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore market equilibrium, it began to sink.
By 228 "no" votes to 205 "yes", MEPs refused to provide the funds requested by Finance Minister Henry Paulson.
Nearly two-thirds of Republicans voted against the plan.
“The market has been filtering out bad signals because Congress seems unable to approve a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was expecting this plan," he said, adding that he was concerned that if such a plan were adopted a few days later, it would be "too late."
"If the plan is really doomed to death (...), it will be the turn of the Fed and other central banks to deal with the crisis, and lending conditions will be tightened further," says Brian Bethune, senior economist at Global Insight.
Piegza added that “every day more and more financial institutions are going bankrupt” in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking business was acquired by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated suddenly, requiring emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market “has developed not only an American but a global crisis,” adds FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has recovered significantly.
The yield of the 10-year government bond fell by Friday evening from 3.827% to 3.632%, and that of the 30-year-old fell the day before from 4.357% to 4.161%.
Obama wins first TV duel
The first debate between the two US presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another one, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would emerge from the duel as the winner.
Unsurprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaign leaders claimed victory in the television duel that was watched by a third of American households.
Political analyst David Gergen said while John McCain's actions were "respectable," they were not "impressive" enough to stop his decline in popularity, according to surveys conducted five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: a poll published Saturday showed that Obama had a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49% respectively).
Among the most calculating yet indecisive voters, 39% say Obama will win, while 25% expect McCain to win, according to a survey conducted by CBS.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his party-mate Joseph Biden’s promising great performance on Thursday, preparing for Biden’s first and only public debate with rival Sarah Palin.
Bill Clinton warned this weekend: “It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
He has good instincts.”
McCain, who was in his 70s, never fails to put his own, undeniably enormous foreign policy experience first, but also emphasizes his opponent’s “naiveness” on these issues that were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” the attack was repeated several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” McCain said.
This is the main attack platform that has been exploited by Republican TV ads running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he was concise and precise.
He stressed his ability to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama already does," a Democrat ad aired on the weekend retorts the Republican leader that he has not yet assessed the impact of the crisis on the American "street people."
"During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina in the rain.
The turmoil in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama, whom the Americans consider most capable of saving an economy on the brink of collapse.
"Next week could be a turning point," Democrat senator Charles Schumer said.
Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat and Clinton veteran, said Obama had “excellent economic instincts” like Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is “the final verdict on eight years of bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite stock market volatility, he will be able to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans, adding that his primary goals include creating the country’s potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources, as well as establishing a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates cautiously avoided questions about the <0x24>700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) bank rescue plan: the extremely unpopular plan was approved by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that an election took place here?"
Young people and opposition protesters protested on Sunday night on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
Following the closure of polling stations on Sunday evening, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in the main square of Minsk to protest the falsification of the election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, a number of young people have protested against President Alexander Lukashenko, saying: 'Mr Dictator, resign!'
Some people admit that they haven’t even gone to vote: “Why would I have gone? They’ll do whatever they want with my vote anyway!” says one young person.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which tried to present itself to foreign observers in a good way in order to build relations with the European Union, is ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were considered clean by the observers, the sanctions imposed on the country could be lifted, including the denial of visas to 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of some bank accounts.
According to the opposition, the elections did not go smoothly.
“We were kept away from election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count,” Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the United Democratic Forces coalition, said in a statement.
“The changes were only nominal,” emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. “The important thing is who counts the votes, and in our case, this is the executive power.
If opposition delegates get into parliament, it means that they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament will allow them to have a place on television, to meet in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore play a role in political life, because "the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
Indeed, if our heavily indebted economy to Russia is in crisis and we are unable to rebuild, we risk falling under Russian control.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the election process, will accept the result of the vote as valid.
They stress that the turnout seems too high, and the widespread organisation of the preliminary vote (in which 26% of the voters in Minsk took part) allowed for any manipulation.
“Did you notice that an election took place here?” asks social democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, who was the last to be released from the prison where he was held as a political prisoner in August.
No one abstained in the polling stations.
There will be a maximum of five opposition members in the parliament, and those who are best suited to the leadership.
The silence of the night is once again on October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are delighted to succeed.
Blood is safe again.
President Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate, because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood donating societies in the world.
Most importantly, he managed to regain people’s trust, which was severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood supply managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Supply Service was infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general uproar, the Canadian government launched an official investigation in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, with the aim of clarifying the circumstances that led to the tragedy and formulating proposals to avoid similar incidents in the future.
While Judge Krever delayed his report, some provinces set up their own committee to design a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
The Gélineau and Krever reports led to the creation of two blood supply services in Canada: the Hema-Québec service in Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Supply Society, which is responsible for supplying all the other provinces and two territories.
“When Hema-Québec started in 1998, just 38% of people had confidence in Quebec’s blood supply system,” Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was desperate.
“In the following years, however, we have managed to regain people’s trust as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field.” Décary proudly states that in early 2008, almost 94% of the population of Quebec considered Héma-Québec reliable.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that “trust is an extremely fragile thing.”
Since the establishment of Héma-Québec on 28 September 1998, the precautionary principle has been applied.
During this period, a number of cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, have been exposed in Europe, says the doctor, who has been running the company since it was founded in 1998.
“We had no idea whether this disease was spread by blood.
That is why we have relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports. According to this, if we are unsure about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, then we should apply exclusion measures. In this case, we were talking about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes brain lesions and thus inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
A few years ago, it was established beyond any doubt that the disease was spread by blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus. This is the nucleic acid test (NAT), which is able to detect the virus itself directly in the blood of donors, rather than the antibodies against the virus on which previous tests were based.
The NAT test allowed us to shorten the window period from infection until we can detect the virus in the blood using our technical tools, the expert explains.
This period could be shortened to less than a week.
Thus, they significantly reduced the risk of unknowingly contaminating the bloodstream by blood donors, and that this could not be detected.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of AIDS spreading through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
“In other words, we should allocate 12 million blood products until someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and someone to become infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think that today anyone can accept or prescribe blood transfusions to restore health, says the number one leader of Héma-Québec.
“The challenge for the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
You never know what kind of new pathogen will enter the system.
After all, it was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood by an insect bite.
Therefore, we must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continued, stressing that, in addition to emergency reserves, Héma-Québec must provide for sufficient permanent reserves.
“As the population ages, the demand is also increasing.
Because anti-cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the blood donor population, as the number of people in the network who are capable of donating blood is only 3% of the population of Quebec.
However, any healthy person at least 18 years of age who meets the eligibility criteria should donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with, for example, AIDS or malaria, and those who have been to a country where malaria is devastating are not eligible to donate blood for a year.
“With these three percent, we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare that we're running out of supplies.
We need to increase the number of blood donors as the existing ones age, because after a while they can no longer donate blood.
But it is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, and it is even harder to keep them and make them regular donors.
In today’s fast-paced world, a man has barely an hour to go and donate blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of <0x24>297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin tissue, which is used almost exclusively for severely burned people.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen and then placed at Héma-Québec, which also manages one public stem cell bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, once treated only as medical waste, can produce blood rich in stem cells, enabling the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the inclusion in our bank of the 1,000th umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than 1,000 new samples each year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering them for organ transplants,” said Dr. Décary, who says that the umbilical cord blood removal program is very popular today.
“Many mothers are saddened that they don’t have the opportunity to do so,” he said, as Héma-Québec is unable to make this complex and costly program available in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semi-final
The Montreal Impact team defeated the Seattle Sounders yesterday 3:1 in the USL-1 qualifying round and reached the semi-final with an overall score of 4:3. It was the second and final game of the quarter-final at Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half went without a goal, in the second, the Montreal team’s two midfielders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, both found their way into the opponent’s net.
From the Sounders, Roger Levesque was the only one who managed to outmaneuver Matt Jordan.
Recall that in its first game on Friday, Impact was defeated 2:1 by Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
Impact will play against Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder lost to the Whitecaps 3:1 in the first game, winning 4:3, but the Whitecaps reached the semi-finals with a 5:4 overall result.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches will be clarified today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens' favorite triad is ready for another season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and in the end the Canadiens won against the Florida Panthers in a 3:2 penalty shootout last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec scored two goals and Kovalev scored a goal pass, which was the fourth victory of the team's six preparation games.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shootout.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warns.
“It takes another game to make me feel really fit.”
"He was trying to get too much out of himself in the first trimester," Guy Carbonneau said.
"But I think he was happy with the outcome of the game.
He's got a huge ovation."
Charest 's Northern Aspirations
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin later this year.
Just after the Liberal Party meeting was over, Jean Charest travelled to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is seeking victory in today’s midterm election.
"To push back our last big northern border": Jean Charest stated this ambitious long-term goal at the Liberal Party meeting in Quebec yesterday in Levis. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, while the president tried to focus on the essence.
During his performance, behind his back, they projected images similar to "Moulin <0xC3><0xA0> images".
The three giant projectors were followed by stunning footage: hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
Such spectacular instruments are used during election periods.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to guarantee that the election will not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule is very tight.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's "vision" for the future of Quebec, embodied in a "new economic area". This includes a labor agreement to be concluded with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several agreements planned with Ontario.
Recently, the opening to the North (i.e. the northern area beginning at 49 degrees latitude) has often been featured in the Prime Minister’s speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this subject.
The head of state, however, confined himself to explaining why he considered the North to be "a treasure trove full of enormous opportunities", but did not speak about the time factor, the amount of investment, or the specific priorities for future projects.
It highlighted only a few opportunities for development: hydroelectric power plants, the forestry sector and mining in particular, which is further stimulated by the growth of catching-up countries and the rebuilding of public infrastructures.
"Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds are found in the north," Charest said.
This area, which is "twice the size of France," "is our territory, the territory of Quebec.
It is not only in us, but in us,” the head of state repeated, emphasizing that it is intended to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec’s development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, the design work in Quebec, the James Bay...
"This is our future," he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador, which Quebec has always claimed for itself, the Prime Minister said at a press conference.
“This is our historic resolution, which has been confirmed by all governments.
“There is a line that has not been agreed on for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will reaffirm the same position on behalf of the government,” he said.
On the other hand, "we also need to rethink our view of the North in the light of climate change," the Prime Minister said, speaking of the Northwest Passage that opens every year as a result of the melting of Arctic ice.
According to the Prime Minister, in this new geopolitical environment, the occupation of the area is an important task.
What about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec is paying special attention to them and that the plan will benefit them, especially young people.
The two ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was the delegate of the Parti Québécois in Ungava), have already begun negotiations with some thirty local communities.
The inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role, has also started its work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit," where "a common vision is created".
The development of the North would otherwise be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, integrated and at the same time environmentally friendly,” the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like previous liberals, we think differently: our goal is to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began with the big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s election as party president on Friday.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be renamed the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“The politicians of our society, including the founder of Hydro-Québec, Godbout, Lesage, the quiet revolution and the nationwide expansion of hydroelectric power plants, and Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future,” Charest said.
At the press conference, he also quoted another – true, conservative – work, John Diefenbaker’s “Roads to the North” program from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam plan, President Charest underlined that commissioning is planned for 2012.
“This remains between us, but I plan to be there,” he told his followers, and his statement was received with a loud applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably no elections in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this autumn, which is also allowed by the law.
He stressed, however, that his calendar is already full, as he took on tasks at the Federal Council meeting in China and the Quebec-New York Summit.
The party meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to explain the nationalist resolutions, which were approved almost without hesitation. Here it is mainly about "constitutional aspirations": the liberal party demands recognition in the Constitution, in particular, of "the peculiarity of Quebec".
They also want Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and have a veto on decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, was skeptical of the main points of the Northern Plan.
Parti Québécois leader Paulina Marois once again raised the issue of development policy in northern Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came to power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they hadn’t done so, “we would have gone much further today,” said Mrs Marois, in agreement with Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure, who was running for the Jean-Talon vote today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government’s approval of the Northern Plan.
“But we want it to be more than a spectacle,” party leader Sébastien Proulx said, replacing Mario Dumont, who has returned from his vacation.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
Vic Toews, the Harper Cabinet Minister (along with his "Justice" minister), took the liberty of calling Louise Arbour Canada's "shame" last summer.
To insult a woman who has fought unceasingly for the truth and deserves all our admiration says a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
So this is our government, which did not take its own citizens home from the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp, by itself, from the Western countries concerned.
This is the government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crimes he was accused of.
It is the only government that, despite the signing of the Geneva Convention by Canada, has denied its word and allowed a child soldier to suffer under inhumane conditions.
The only government to turn justice into a puppet show while investigating a defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are also demanding the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
And our government closes its eyes to the torture: it doesn’t matter to him that a young adult has already been completely spiritually ruined, and years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
“Democracy”: Harper constantly echoes this word, which, from his mouth, sounds like nothing but empty words.
The time has come, then, when morality no longer exists: they can arbitrarily beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen at the will of a government leader who has been in a minority so far (and what can happen after October 14th...?).
Many electors believe that salvation can be found in a party that glorifies Virtue, Law and Order. They do not see that this government tramples on the values to which our country owes its good name and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, the shame is rather this - do not look elsewhere.
The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter was published from Patrick J. Garver, deputy chairman and chief executive officer of the Barrick Gold Mine in Canada.
In response to Orwell’s remarks, Garver claims that the world’s largest gold-producing company has filed a <0x24>6 million defamation suit against three authors and a low-cost publishing company to initiate a so-called “public debate.”
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decision, especially in defamation cases, is not based on the truth, but on the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver kept a deep silence about this fundamental difference.
Is it really the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate, to destroy anyone who has a position against his?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money on defense and combat in an unequal battle with an army of lawyers on the other side supported by almost inexhaustible resources from the mining industry.
In such an unequal struggle, by the way, the tactic of destroying the defendant and making a friendly settlement is often used, not only to silence the opponents, but even to intimidate those who would try to reconsider the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views before the public.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, this is different, in Canada the parties to the dispute usually do not beat each other with sticks, but express their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have sufficed to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in the press, media, and publications, paying independent research groups that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust the public, and in a single move, he swept away petitions and letters to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can initiate a 'public' debate if, at the same time, he disregards the opinion of this public?
In the vice president’s mind, this word probably only means paid lawyers, not the total population of Canada: the meaning of the term is thus greatly reduced.
In a democratic state, even those who denigrate others are entitled to freedom of speech.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are supported by the public mainly because they condemn the rude practices of the mine.
Public opinion is ready to listen to Barrick and make a verdict, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments, rather than a lawsuit aimed at silence for many. (In connection with the term "public debate", Barrick Gold recently wrote to the Noir Canada authors to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver’s surreal discussions, Barrick Gold’s policy openly attacks the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of any democratic society.
The procedure as a whole denies the right to cite credible sources, as well as to debate the facts and their interpretation, which form the basis of intellectual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, it is possible to study and discuss issues that are not pleasing to the wealthy companies of today’s world only under the burden of litigation, who will dare to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to respond.
In our academic circle, we have long been able to deal with disputes, differences and conflicts.
Barrick Gold's reckless conduct shows that, contrary to what he says, he has no desire to conduct an open debate.
This is a loss both for the world of universities and for the Canadian public debate institution, and it is time for governments to finally put in place measures to limit legal proceedings for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue: Democrats and Republicans Agree
Yesterday, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Bush administration and Congress finally reached an agreement on an economic bailout, the largest such plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The <0x24>700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has raged on Wall Street for months still needs to be approved by the two Houses of Congress.
The key points of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by MEPs; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of planned public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses confiscated due to non-payment; right of access to the salaries of managers of assisted companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican MP Judd Gregg announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon trial ended.
“We’ve made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a Bush administration spokesman.
“We have done everything to save the real economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
“The most important point is that if we don’t do this, there will be tremendous shock, chaos and confusion in the daily lives of Americans,” Republican MP Judd Gregg said in a statement.
The negotiations have been speeded up in the last few hours, fearing that another failure could have a detrimental effect on investors’ moods.
The deadline for the agreement was set for the opening of the stock exchange this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed willingness to reach an agreement, but expressed their displeasure that the situation had escalated to the end.
Democratic senator Barack Obama attributed the extension of the deal to himself with elements such as provisions on the preservation of home ownership or the salaries of executives of state-aided companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of other people, that is not very welcome.
“These steps are necessary,” he said on a US television show.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied, “I want to know the details, but I hope it does.”
“What I have read in broad terms is already apparent from the fact that it is something that we all have to devour and through which we can move forward.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The <0x24>700 billion plan is to use taxpayers’ money to buy the dubious claims of U.S. financial institutions and their risky, non-sellable assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the bursting of the real estate balloon, which first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), then spread to other debt (commercial) securities, and finally caused the freezing of liquid resources and the turmoil of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was overthrown by a group of Republican MPs last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this deadlock since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty should be provided by the government rather than bought up.
In order to satisfy all members of Congress, a provision has been included in the plan that stipulates that if the government is required to bear losses under the program for five years, it may levy new taxes to recover its funds.
As part of the new plan, a <0x24>250 billion instalment would be paid first, followed by an additional <0x24>100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The remaining <0x24>350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for the help, Washington acquires a stake in the subsidized companies, through which it receives dividends from the profits and can sell them after the crisis has ended.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure of real estate to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan. In addition, it can set the maximum salary and severance pay to managers of companies affected by the crisis.
The drafters would like the plan to be approved by the House of Representatives today and by the Senate on Wednesday.
However, despite their efforts, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
There were repeated statements of opposition to the plan, both among Republicans and Democrats.
"It is clear that Washington will not hear your voice," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, told voters.
“We have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is nothing that will benefit the taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, a Democrat leader of a small congressional group called the "Sceptic faction," presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“400 distinguished economists, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us asking Congress not to rush and carefully examine which path to take,” Sherman said.
At the same moment in Europe, it was once again understood that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalize part of the Fortis banking group in the amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (US<0x24>16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French company BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its close-to-banking competitor after losing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million (<0x24>2.9 billion) as a result of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the 20 largest European banks and one of the ten largest insurance companies.
"This is not a waste of money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“In return, we will acquire voting rights and influence in the bank.
That’s exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government seems to be planning to nationalize another bank that has been swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which real estate loans amount to <0xC2><0xA3>41 billion (<0x24>75.5 billion).
Spain’s Santander bank has announced it will acquire its subsidiaries and customers.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) Farewell to the Idol
His beautiful azure eyes were considered by some to be his greatest hit, others to be his greatest weakness.
Has the charming American actor ever gotten rid of his Narcissist mirror?
Yes, and no.
Due to his shyness, sensitivity and innate talent, he was also far removed from the loud style that is the essence of the true great monsters of the art world.
But what a great track he ran!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at the age of 83 on Friday at his home in Connecticut, one of the last icons of American cinema’s flourishing era.
He was less of a monumental individual than Brando, who for a long time was a competitor on the screen. He was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable in his roles, but he also advocated freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
From the mixing of blood, extraordinary children are often born.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
The European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic figures of the American dream.
He didn't think too much of himself, which only increased his merits.
In the early 1950s, he studied drama at Yale University, then at Actor's Studio in New York City, before he exploded into the world of theatre, television, and soon afterwards into the world of cinema.
In addition to being a champion of civil rights, he finished second at the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979 as a racing driver, and was considered a sex symbol, although he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know the dark side of the life of this mysterious, reclusive, dedicated actor, who hated the glamour of show-business, which will remain a mystery forever.
He was an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman at the end of the week shocked movie fans: in his major roles, we can only see him on the black screen of memories.
Reviewing his life’s work, the seventh American art has been in front of us for more than fifty years.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), who played him in the 1958 Tennessee Williams adaptation of Cat on the Hot Tin Roof.
From recent times (1990) we can remember him in the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who faces his old age with the fact that his marriage has failed to fulfill his hopes.
Paul Newman has seen many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film Someone Up, he starred in the role of rocky Graziano, a turbulent criminal-boxer, who was originally intended for James Dean, and was renamed after his death, and started Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work "The Big Trouble", which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
Robert Rossen played a bitter, vengeful pool player in The Swindler (1961), and returned to Martin Scorsese's "The Color of Money", for which he received a single Oscar nomination in 1987.
Changed times, but always the same face: it was him.
He's always been like this.
The period of his career was marked by changes in periods.
The younger ones are best known for George Roy Hill's "Icebreakers" (1977), where he plays Reggie Dunlop, the unconventional coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans saw him in the Coen brothers' "The Great Leap" in 1994.
Sam Mendes's 2003 film "The Way to Hell" was his last appearance as an Irish mafia boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the screen relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood with its glitter, luxury, and hypocrisy.
French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not consider it a “live refutation of underplay” without all the humor: he thought his game was too powerful.
The profession, however, was not always gracious to the handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time just fell in love with the film roles.
Yet he rarely played young and successful characters: rather he formed characters living on the fringes of society - neurotic, alcoholic, malevolent or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he was able to reproduce with perfect authenticity.
As a director, Newman showed a lesser-known face: a very shy and sensitive man in the depths of his soul.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (an adaptation of the novel by Canadian author Margaret Laurence), he and his wife, Joanne Woodward, starred in a subtle portrait of a melancholic woman.
The 1984 film "Harry and his Son" is a tribute to his son Scott, who died of a drug overdose.
Yesterday, countless admirers of Newman commemorated the actor. His close friend and old fellow warrior Robert Redford (who played together in "The Big Trouble" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"), sadly, said: "His presence has made my life and the world better.
Generosity and the joy of being: this was the secret of the vibrant individuality of this great actor that we have now lost.
Along with his legendary career, he is obscured by his struggle for civil rights, the environment, independent filmmaking, and his critical remarks about Hollywood’s lewdness.
Many times we saw his picture smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with a bad taste in his mouth, although at the beginning he still thought it funny.
However, the proceeds from such sales have always been transferred to the foundation for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession all along.
In a letter he left to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: “Your father was always and always unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
We are also privileged to have accompanied the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model, above all.
What was produced at Zuschlag & Tsai’s invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused of fraud and other crimes, including forgery of documents, which have caused particularly significant damage to the criminal organisation.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the winning tender funds were used for their own purposes, and the fulfilment of the tasks was often proved by false invoices.
The state and municipal funds – totalling about 65 million forints – migrated partly into the Young Left’s cash register and partly into the pockets of some people.
The method also described by the investigative authority was that the winning tender funds were taken on the basis of cost accounts, behind which there was no real performance, and the associations never complied with the undertaking.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
The invoice blocks were purchased in the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, and the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
The name of the companies to be invoiced was decided, among other things, on the Balaton-felvidék kör<0xC3><0xBA>t, to which J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag sent Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to look out for pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, which was followed by invoices to be submitted to the tenders of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Municipality of Budapest, among others.
These were mostly written by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his partner Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, mostly wrote the reports needed to win the grants.
One of the highlights of Lados’ study trip was a beer house.
According to two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, the restaurant provided food for a group of ninety members of the Surety Point Association.
However, according to the manager, they would not have been able to enter the restaurant at the same time.
In the same way, the invoice issued to the Foundation for a Better Future – later named Together for the Third Millennium – in the summer of 2002 was fraught with errors in form and content.
A boarding house in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet the bill was for one hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative form fillers were also exaggerated when they marked Pigal Kft., which is also a catering company, in whose accounts, according to the information given to the prosecution, the documents concerning the Better Future and the name of Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> were not included.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the head of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and presented him with invoices, he knew immediately that these were false documents.
"Our business name and tax number were incorrectly marked on the stamp."
He added that, apart from the formal reasons, it was also not correct that according to the invoice, a hundred people were accommodated, since they have a total of eleven rooms, in which there is not so much room.
In addition, the bill was also for catering, while their restaurant hasn't been operating for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoicing companies did not look into the fact that the Budapest travel agency they looked at only organizes trips abroad, so they bluntly marked Hungarian travel as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not match the company’s invoicing practice.
In addition, as the investigation revealed, VAT was also included in the document, even though the travel activities to countries outside the European Union were exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was also wrong in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for Better Future, because the company’s services are not subject to the indicated 25 percent VAT, but 15 percent VAT, in addition, the hotel employees only issued a machine invoice, while the invoice produced was manual.
In addition, the "exhibitors" also corrupted the invoices by marking road freight transport as an activity performed in the case of a company, which the company, originally based on investment advice, did not carry out.
In addition, it also failed due to formal deviations - an incorrect invoice format, not a real stamp - that the invoices for the United for the Third Millennium Foundation, the Cultural Association of the 21st century and the Safe Point are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft. in Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the group of the Young City Association ate there, and therefore the company’s liquidator’s commissioner – to the best of our knowledge – denied that he had issued the paper.
Consciously exhibited
The other group of account issuers are those who were aware of the need to issue a fictitious account.
The Chance for Budapest Foundation issued an invoice for the United for the Third Millennium Foundation at the request of the Young Left-Young Socialists for about HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, persuaded the head of Collab Ltd. to issue the fictitious invoice.
He also cooperated with the Zuschlags, the Biogate Kft. currently under liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlasz Association and the Redwood Association with invoices worth roughly HUF 5 million, behind which there was no real economic activity.
There was no movement of money either, because the invoices were then checked out, but the organizations forgot to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing invoices are those that are linked to the accused.
Thus, Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov was the delivery agent of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., which is based in Budapest, but is not located there.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment, worth about HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft., which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian man to whom Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Cubatov would have forwarded the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
Cubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppa and the United for the Third Millennium Foundation, and that he took their consideration.
At the request of Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually worked, which, according to the defendant, was due to the fact that they did not get a job.
At the request of Zsolt Szente, a lawyer who also prepared the documents for company formations, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Cubatov provided 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutors said 10% of the bills and VAT had hit Cubatov's mark.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, which were produced for the application of the T<0xC5><0x91>zs<0xC5><0x91> Pont.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary submitted an application to the T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Foundation (TMA), a non-profit organization of the Socialist Party.
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were filed with TMA.
These bills were found during a house search in <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei’s office at his education portfolio.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did at the prosecutor's office, are likely to report on the process of producing invoices.
The most interesting thing is that you are the first-rate defendant, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag, who decides to unveil everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether this is in his interest, or whether the socialists made a deal with him in exchange for the compensation of a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, and Zusi takes the blame.
By the way, he may have been offended by the fact that his requests to ease the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to place him under house arrest, were constantly on deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much greater harm and do not reimburse them can walk freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their own homes, they do not have the opportunity to do so.
The Psychology of Overbidding: Why Do We Spend More Money?
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
Neuroscientists and economists at the University of New York have uncovered the neurological and economical foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to lose in a competition such as eBay auctions, so they tend to pay too high a price.
The research attempted to map the neurological pattern of this "play" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers participated in the lottery, the other group participated in a player auction, while using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the active brain areas of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction game, in which an essential element was the overbidding of the other party, the striatum, a subcortical complex called the striatum, became intensely active when the game was lost.
This area of the brain, in addition to several other functions, plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in price can be explained by avoiding the fierce reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
Three groups bid against one partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they placed their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they got out of the game, they would be rewarded with another <0x24>15 in cash.
The third group, on the other hand, was paid <0x24>15 before the auction, but the group members lost that money in the event of a losing auction.
The only difference between the two groups, therefore, was that they emphasized winning for one group and losing for the other.
Proving the neuroscientists' hypothesis, however, members of the team playing "against loss" were willing to bet higher than the control and "win" groups.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
Until now, they have only explained the phenomena of the auction with the joy of victory and risk evasion.
“Only neurological imaging techniques have helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories, and we have now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide are infected with chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death in Hungary.
The number of people living with hepatitis in Hungary is estimated to be 100,000, but only 7,000 are treated, which is due to the fact that patients are often unaware that they are infected.
The term hepatitis is a common name for liver infections caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, characterized by inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause differ.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, with infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (egg, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travellers should be protected against the A and B viruses, there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected food, generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal complaints, nausea.
After this, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes develops, the stool is light, the urine turns dark, healing can take two to three weeks.
Worldwide, one million people die each year from the most severe form of hepatitis B, liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected receives medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can also lead to cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys the cells of the liver, in many cases the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to carry out early prevention and regular screening tests.
In three groups, the incidence of these diseases is much higher than average: among people who had had blood transfusions before 1991, among drug users and among tattooed people.
The number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is currently around 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult a GP if any symptoms of unknown origin are detected.
With timely detection, the disease can be cured, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus eliminating the infectivity and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first held in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God hurt less?
According to a recent study, religious beliefs act as a kind of painkiller that may have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment to investigate how belief in God affects people’s sense of pain, according to the British Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were electroshocked while they were all studying a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholics were able to rule out most of the pain.
Thanks to the technology that scans the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The study is the first in a series of research involving academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The study was carried out precisely by attaching a sparking device to the test subject’s left hand, which provided the electroshock.
The researchers asked participants to look closely at two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci's painting of the Lady with Hermelin in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would bring about a religious state among believers, while the image of da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to have a soothing effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive episodes while either looking at the religious theme or the general picture.
Catholics reported that when they saw the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe” as if they had “taken care of her” and “been calm and at peace.”
When looking at a religious image, they reported 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who was himself involved in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, even with atheists, only the right photo needs to be found.
"We should find a picture of someone they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father," he said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the study.
“Practicing faith should and in many cases will change our personality,” Wright said.
After the great results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a similar caliber painter were to show the image of a madonna to the faithful, what effect would that have on their pain management?
Would the sight of the quality of the Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can tell you: it’s in people’s pockets at least as much as it’s in the sky above their heads; he knows where they’ve been on vacation, what appointments they’re attending and what they’re interested in.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s top executives.
As for the skeptics who draw parallels to the Orwellian horror, they do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect more personal information about its users, and that this is necessary to keep up with the original goal of Google founders, which was to “collect all the information in the world.”
According to Google, after ten years of world-changing work, the company is still at the very beginning of being able to handle all the information.
Asked what’s going to happen in five years, Schmidt said he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like “What should I do tomorrow?” or “What kind of work should I really do?”—but until then, software can’t answer questions that seem simple because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware of the fact that when searching the Internet, the search terms are recorded exactly, from which IP address they were searched and to which page they went after the search.
For example, the Personalized Search, launched two years ago, allows users to store their own surfing history, to look back on what they were looking for, what they clicked on, and to generate much more personalized results for them in the long run - the same logic will be used in the Recommendations, which is used to offer us products and services based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they look at what I’m doing?, users who are worried about seeing Google’s data monopoly ask.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or rebellion against power, which triggers counter-reactions among internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all searched terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases they can also be transferred to third parties, in such cases the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected by anything.
Perhaps the loudest example of this in recent times has been a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about pedophiles from its social network Orkut, which allows it to identify them.
However, internet users concerned about privacy sighed in May, when the company, along with the EFF, successfully proved their truth in court against the FBI, saying that Google could not be forced by any part of the constitution to disclose any information that the FBI was secretly asking for.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully managed to obtain some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, which it has obtained by citing the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but has failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and a complete two-month list of websites and keywords.)
Google’s view is therefore rather controversial: it is being scourged by those who fear giving away their personal data because they feel their privacy and privacy is being compromised by using Google’s services and revolting against them with a revolt against the conservative image of multi-companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its savagery of enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users in many countries see the next generation of big companies, the "cool corporation," in contrast to its rival, Microsoft, who has been described as a world conqueror for Windows, no matter how much they both struggle for the same goal.
This may be because Google doesn’t ask its users for an ID code, doesn’t ask for money for its applications, and the open, free, constantly updated source code and suite of programs seems much more accessible, youthful, and cooler than the official software giant’s practices.
However, it may also be because geeks have a clear understanding of the very problematic relationship between privacy and the internet, which has been brought about by one of the most frequently mentioned keywords of recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about intentionally leaving footprints and using the communication channels available to us, and while the scale of these varies from one person to another, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can manage profiles on multiple social networks from Facebook to Xanga, connect them to other services such as Twitter, or last.fm listing their music habits, and then connect them all to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and also manage a blog that automatically hosts their latest photo galleries, which they have on their Flicks.
While there are a number of exemplary cases that she can see: a girlfriend can easily find out by seeing the morning photo flood of a group of friends with whom a fraudulent friend spent the evening, or she can fire a company employee just because she writes her honest opinion on senior management in her blog: one thing is certain, the concept of privacy has been completely re-evaluated by now.
Those who live online are made up of what they show themselves, and this is how we can formulate the underlying principle behind the behavior of today’s young people.
If you want to hide something, or at least avoid Google’s monopoly, you can do it (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google’s search system but leaves no trace at the same time).
For example, the number of people who deliberately don’t register for social networks so that they can’t be found, Google’s online apps from word processor to image manager and news reader can be replaced with alternative versions that aren’t linked to huge server parks and that don’t build the best profile we’ve ever had.
The public isn’t so secretly waiting for Google to show off its teeth.
With its current value of <0x24>156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM (<0x24>140 billion), Intel (<0x24>124 billion) or Coca-Cola (<0x24>110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms are threatening advertising revenues, and the ever-accelerating services are causing serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
Critical contemplators, however, also find these disturbing counterpoints: for example, the top management completely rejected the protests of employees after it doubled the fee of the company’s kindergarten, the management found the daily arbitrarily frequent catering of employees too expensive, but all of this is in the interest of the Chinese government, and all of that is in the interest of the Chinese government.
One of the company’s internal rules is that no new service will be announced in advance, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at a new point: while some believe that Google’s book and magazine scanning and archiving project has taken on such a scale that the company will soon have to face up to the U.S. Supreme Court of Health.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database could be a good resource for the next generation of science fiction writers, according to the popular novel by Cory Doctorow, Scroogled, with Orwellian overtones, describes a future in which a person can only be approached alarmingly well from Google’s data.
Two juveniles helped the <0xC3><0x93>zd double murderer in the de-lack
Two young people were questioned by the police in the case of the double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd, and the well-founded suspicion was that they helped to remove the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County Police Headquarters said on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the charge and are currently accused of accomplices.
According to MTI, the two girls are on the loose.
Commitment to crime can be punishable by up to five years in prison.
The suspect in the Ozd double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
He's premeditated, for profit, on suspicion of multiple homicides.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old man owed a larger sum to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he lured his creditor to an <0xC3><0x93>zd site last Wednesday, where he killed him, and then he killed his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was preparing to commit the crime in advance, a sign of which is that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
The gun and the conditions of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers to Buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million – about five billion Czech crowns – to buy the 100 percent stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwig Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been excluded by the Czechs from any new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of the shares within a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 knows that the bid of the Poles is the highest amount so far offered by interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Stock Exchange have submitted bids so far.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner among those interested, and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by market experts at between 5 and 10 billion kroons.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90 percent of the papers could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a 25 percent stake, followed by the bank Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on Tuesday, which are devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers are already talking about “the second of September 11”.
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American President, accused by La Repubblica in Rome, who has not even been able to queue his own party behind a bill that has been quickly put together to remedy the desperate situation.
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, referred to by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about the second of September 11.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has put the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, the congressional vote puts Washington in danger of not providing the political means to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air – at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says Geneva’s Tage-Anzeiger.
Today, some states can provide a lifeline for the surviving financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither the funds nor the improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to overcome their national selfishness and centralise control of fragmented financial markets.
“On Monday alone, more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion were given to the failing financial institutions,” the Vienna Der Standard said, adding that concerns that European taxpayers, like the Americans, need to put their hands deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis that is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
The "rescuers" do not need to whistle hundreds of billions of euros at once, but it would be good to note when it makes sense to use taxpayers' money to prevent further damage.
A smart car imitates the flight of a bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop collision avoidance technologies, if not the imitation of obstacle detectors in the natural world?
Bees, for example.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, Bumblebees gave Nissan engineers the strategic starting point for building the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has developed the BR23C bio-imitation car robotic control system, a robotic mini-car with bee features, with the ultimate goal of helping design a system that eliminates all collisions.
While flying, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is in fact very similar to our safety cover,” explained Kazuhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and R&D Branding at the exhibition.
An important role is played by the complex eye of the uterus, which can see in all directions from an angle of view of more than 300 degrees.
To replicate the function of the complex eye, the engineers turned to the idea of a laser distance meter.
It identifies obstacles within a distance of 2 meters in a 180-degree field of vision in front of the BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into a collision avoidance operation.
Within a fraction of a second, the obstruction is detected, and the car robot, imitating the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to avoid a collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance manoeuvre takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If this were not the case, the car-robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car-robot project.
It should react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shield, a layer within which a collision is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, the deviation must not be upwards, downwards or diagonally, it must be only two-dimensional and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities available to bees to bypass other bees, only rotating movement and acceleration, as well as deceleration, were used as an available option for the car robot.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer service life than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, instinctive intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process data, even less the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process and respond to a few input signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so you will constantly use only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of an immediate bypass technology, which Nissan estimates will be able to enter production vehicles within 10 years.
Additional applications may include the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to the specified destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
He has a name for a very expensive child.
A written version of the <0x24>700 billion economic bailout law for the purchase of bad loans by banks has been prepared.
At first half of the amount is spent.
According to East Coast time, during further talks that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on a <0x24>700 billion bailout package that has been going on for days, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, said in a statement.
The compromise was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking about the outcome of the compromise, Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the program will work and be effective, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the cart of the economy.
The written version of the package was released before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday night at 8 a.m. (i.e. Monday morning at 2 p.m. Central European time), but did not cause a spectacular upturn in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the draft law on the program, which is called the Economic Emergency Stabilisation Act 2008.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House welcomed news of the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that the <0x24>700 billion would have been spent one-on-one on buying low-quality, credit-backed securities.
Now, in the first round, no more than half of the <0x24>700 billion can be spent, with <0x24>250 billion being spent immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday, from which the Treasury Department will buy badly rated securities with a credit background, and the fate of another <0x24>100 billion will depend on the president’s decision.
The program will be monitored by a separate body, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
Spending the other half of the 700 billion will depend on a new Congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic: to buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities at the same time, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can be made through auctions and directly, the ministry said.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the financial ministry guarantees the means of concern, for which the companies will pay a fee appropriate to the expected damages.
According to Henry Paulson, the law provides the necessary means to provide up to <0x24>700 billion for the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it is the widespread purchase or insurance of bad assets or the avoidance of systemic risk associated with the collapse of a major financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
But the bosses of banks that are in trouble and waiting for government help can count on the government to limit their exit money, which overseas slang simply calls a golden parachute.
Salaries are limited only in certain cases, and the limits depend on how the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
Restriction essentially means that if the ministry buys through an auction, an additional tax will be levied on the gold parachute unless the levitated bank manager is retired.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that managerial money is not exaggerated.
The picture adds that the existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the restriction will only apply to new ones, in order to encourage participation in the program.
“This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs,” Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.
In addition, the State acquires the right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the scheme, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, since they can ultimately win on the transaction once the economy and with it the bank that was rescued recovers.
The bill states that over the next five years, the president will have to submit a proposal to Congress that will set out how to reimburse taxpayers for expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were some on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
“This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, that is to say, it does not protect taxpayers’ dollars,” said Republican congressman Darrell Issa.
Mary Kaptur, a Democratic colleague in Ohio, said the measures had been pushed by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
The domestic sales prices of industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, reports the Central Statistical Office.
Prices of industrial export sales were 1.1% higher than in July 2008, down 3.9% year-on-year.
As a result of the changes in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices were 0.7 per cent higher than in the previous month and 3.2 per cent higher than in the previous year.
Compared to the previous month, the domestic sales prices of the industry increased only marginally, by 0.1 percent.
Domestic sales prices of manufacturing industries also increased slightly by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The biggest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the 4.6 per cent monthly price increase in the manufacture of handbags and straps and 2.5 per cent monthly price increase in the manufacture of footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6%).
There were price decreases in the petroleum processing (1.4%), electrical machine and instrument manufacturing (0.9%) and, to a minimum, in the wood processing (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities did not change.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we measured a price increase of between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which represents a significant part of the domestic sales of the industry, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the spillover effect of the official gas price increase implemented from 1 July.
Compared to the domestic sales of the manufacturing sectors, prices in the petroleum processing sector increased the most in twelve months (32.4%).
In the manufacturing of metalworking products, the price increase was 13.2%, while in the food, beverage and tobacco manufacturing sector, which is the dominant weight, an increase of 11% was observed.
The decrease in prices occurred in the textile, textile goods and electrical machinery and instruments sectors (2.5 per cent) and in the manufacturing of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increase was between 0.6 percent and 9.1 percent.
In the manufacturing industry as a whole, prices have increased by 10.2% over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 percent higher than a year earlier.
Among the intended groups of sectors, domestic sales showed the largest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in the sectors producing investment goods in August.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices grew by 0.3 per cent, and in the energy and re-use sectors, prices did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in the energy and reuse sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, we measured a 6.8 percent price increase and in investment goods a 1.4 percent price decrease.
Export sales prices of industry, measured in HUF, increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, and decreased by 3.9 per cent in 12 months.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro and 7.1 per cent against the dollar in one month, and strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar in August 2007.
Will you need a visa to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around January 12 – the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In his opinion, "it all depends on whether electronic access control and monitoring systems are built in time overseas."
At the same time, he pointed out that the new system will not have an entry permit, but tourists will have to register before departure.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is conducting talks in Washington.
He will meet with Minister of Foreign Affairs Condoleezza Rice, to whom the Central Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary will award the Star and will hold talks with the advisers of the Democratic Party Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are on the sidelines of the bank rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, two presidential candidates for the two major U.S. parties, both backed the government’s <0x24>700 billion bank rescue package on Sunday, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
After days of marathon negotiations, representatives of Congress and the administration announced at dawn on Sunday that they had reached an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package aimed at melting the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain claim that they are better suited than their rivals to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, as economic issues came to the fore, Obama once again gained some advantage, melting McCain's advantage, which he gained after the Republican convention, with Sarah Palin's nomination as vice president.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that the <0x24>700 billion bill would be passed quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal includes the consumer protection passages that he also supported.
“We must act now, with responsibility, threatening your jobs, your savings, your entire industries, the stability of the entire economy,” he said.
He didn’t miss calling McCain’s economic ideas obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We’re all going to have a hard time swallowing this... but doing nothing is simply not a viable way to do it.”
The Republican senator said the proposal included the establishment of a committee to monitor the finance minister and the restriction of severance payments to top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the negotiations, but that he was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will hopefully vote on the bill on Monday.

The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp have the voters become more self-aware – so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter, the Bavarian Revolution Devours its Parents, analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
For decades, Christian socialists have reformed Bavaria - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from it.
The era change is also the problem of the whole Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not surprising to the CSU, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to have happened almost exactly ten years ago ended: the undisputed hegemony of a party of states was eliminated.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, below 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the Stoiber era.
This is because the CSU has consistently modernized the province, devouring its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were wrong at the pace. However, it could not have been without consequences for the CSU’s loyalty to the voters, secularization, educational achievements, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and its political consequences are also visible.
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp have the voters become more self-conscious, more critical, more headstrong.
It is also striking that in the last few weeks it was the classical civic groups that were most distant from the CSU; the liberals, the industrialists, the graduates and the graduates.
Support for the CSU has already shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Conservative daily in Vienna deals with the turbulent domestic political situation after the Austrian elections in an article entitled "Who, with whom? The party presidents in moderate coalition issues".
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens do not yet want to negotiate on the coalition.
The election has taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public service television the party leaders have barely given an insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed his intention to negotiate with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that it is possible for the two parties to work together - in some provinces and in the social partnership.
The question of whether a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current President of the ÖVP as Vice-Chancellor - could be imagined was left open by Faymann.
The Schüssel-Molterer course has been rejected.
There is no question of repeating this direction.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of ÖVP.
Whether his party elects the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open in the party for the time being, the issues must necessarily be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ once again showed openness in all directions.
“In order to prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities for All has started in Paris today and this year it is hosted by the French Presidency of the European Union.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, Fidesz representative of the European People’s Party, in her message to the plenary as one of the main speakers of the professional conference, called attention to educational segregation, because it is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and it is also the most serious obstacle to their success.
The high-level conference was opened on behalf of the French Presidency by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and the most important European human rights defenders and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities were invited to the meeting.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka warned, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, Roma are excluded from the labour market mainly due to their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have a secondary education and, due to the poor quality of primary education, only a small proportion of them can obtain higher education."
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can help to strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these connections to the widest possible extent, including among Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the more chances they have to become productive members of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid on income and consumption.
“Roma should have the right to quality education in their right to EU citizenship, and the elimination of their low-quality and segregated education should be guaranteed,” L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
According to the MEP, the goal and action-oriented co-operation of the European Union is necessary to speed up the desegregation processes in schools immediately, for which the correct enforcement of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
“The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities of democratic space, so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,” J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
In the spirit of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for a Temporary Period
At the end of October, they will decide on the fate of the disbanded Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the unspeakable election failure, heads have not yet fallen, and the discussion of personnel issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed for the time being.
Party leader Erwin Huber and provincial prime minister Günther Beckstein will remain in their seats, with the question of how long the grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent vote loss, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the much-criticized couple made it clear that they did not cling to their chairs with all their strength.
This was an attempt to appease the furious members of the faction and the base, who demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority the day after the "Bavarian tsunami".
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, the Christian Social Union gained 60.7% of its power, but now, a year after the Stoiber coup, it only ran to 43.4% of its power.
For 46 years, the CSU has been a “single ruler” in Bavaria, which accounts for 18% of Germany’s GDP.
Although the Conservatives continue to count heavily in the southern province, which is key to the Hungarian economy, they will be forced to form a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of a reorganization within the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture, who is a potential successor to Huber, will also have a seat in the narrow reconnaissance team that will start negotiations with the liberal FDP and the Free Electors, which are organized along right-wing values, on a possible government coalition in Munich.
It is strange that Gabriele Pauli, whose actions against Stoiber were exploited by the Huber-Beckstein pair as a coup d'état, and then ruthlessly treated the ambitious municipal politician.
CSU executives are now devoting all their energy to stabilizing Beckstein somehow.
In the transition, Stoiber, who has been weaving the strings so far, will also play an active role, and the former provincial prime minister and former CSU president called September 28 the most bitter day in his political career.
On Monday, Huber released some bizarre remarks to the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to both CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success of 2005, is somehow jointly restored.
Merkel, hard to hide her frustration over the fiasco, said the CSU’s loss of soil will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
Which, of course, is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria since 1946 by 18.6 percent.
Lukashenko resistance: 110-0
Not a single member of the opposition has entered the Belarusian parliament following Sunday’s election.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the illegalities committed at the time of counting the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the country’s 100-million-strong legislature has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday’s elections, the opposition, united under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the controversial elections in 2006, would “allow” some opposition MPs to appear in the parliament.
The ODSZ also withdrew from the previously considered boycott.
The opposition’s expectations were based on the fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia – which has taken out loans to reduce the ever-expensive Russian gas imports and has also contributed to the transfer of Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines through the country, into Russian hands – wanted to improve its relations with the EU due to a non-political regime and a high-ranking Belarusian political party, which is considered anti-democratic.
The OSCE’s emphasis on positive moves rather than shortcomings – for example, the banning of a third of opposition candidates – was a relief when evaluating the election campaign.
However, the OSCE's flash report on Monday also criticised the campaign - during which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not able to be present at the counting of votes.
Nevertheless, the opposition said there was a marked improvement in the political system: political prisoners were released and Minsk was willing to face a minor confrontation with Moscow, still refusing to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which had separated from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, had considered the two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich said.
The opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election said it was “desirable” that this should remain, despite the fact that “the power is afraid of allowing even an opposition to enter the weightless parliament”.
The opposition is not planning any protest actions in view of the results, but rather is trying to convey its message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
“Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, the local authorities are putting up barriers to dissemination, but I can see that more and more people support change, including among the elderly,” Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that Lukashenko’s regime, which considers the creation of social security as its main result, is not even suitable for the most officially supported pensioners.
“Because of the country’s indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it’s a matter of time before the social security system that evokes the silence of a cemetery breaks down,” Milinkevich said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, the head of the CIS mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that “people believe not in words but in actions”, so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before working hours"
In a unique way in the history of the Chigi Palace, revolving doors have been installed for the entry and exit of employees.
As of today, this new measure will be in place against the skilful, to filter out those who block and then go for a coffee during working hours.
The anti-snatch novelty was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister’s Office.
"The rotary gates," Brunetta said, "are designed to work better and more efficiently, reduce absences and increase services."
"A new, more responsible and transparent period is coming.
This is true reform," Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, “the installation of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
We did not see any resistance on the part of the employees, the secretary-general confirmed: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
In a word, breakfast is over at work, no more coffee and brioche.
Brunetta, smiling, advises: "A good cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning can do wonders."
The Rome College of Public Administration
At the meeting, the minister said: “Over three months, the number of absences from the public sector due to illness has decreased by 50 percent, which means that sixty thousand more people are in work in one year.”
However, he added that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
“Wage dynamics, according to the minister, have been twice the size of the private sector in the last eight to ten years and have also been well above the inflation rate.”
At the same time, thousands of public servants have gathered to join a petition supported by the Italian Association of Environmental and Consumer Associations to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta Decree.
"While the Minister of Public Administration boasts data supporting the reduction of absences due to illness, the number of 'incessant sluggish people' is steadily growing," the Consumer Protection Association writes.
Thousands of honest and hard-working administrative workers have gathered across Italy to declare war on the illegal provisions of the decree.”
The regional administrative court is challenged, among other things, the abolition of supplementary sickness benefits for illnesses attributable to reasons of service, the extension of the period of stay of sick leave workers at home, which refers to the period within which the sick visitor may appear, and several other aspects of the new provisions laid down by the Minister.
Workplace accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything else
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, of which 3 result in death and 27 result in permanent disability.
According to data from the occupational accident insurance company, there were nearly 1,200 deaths in the workplace in 2007.
The figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death today, and which requires almost twice as many deaths as homicide.
Today, Anmil is celebrating the 58th anniversary of the Day of the Victims of Workplace Accidents, traditionally celebrated on the second Sunday of October, in every county in Italy, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and the mass media to this dramatic problem.
“The alarming figures reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm that prevention is of paramount importance in workplace accidents,” said Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Republic, in a message to Pietro Mercandelli, the president of the National Association of Workplace Disabled Persons.
The head of state sincerely praised the association’s “steadfast commitment to workplace prevention, protecting the interests of workers affected by accidents, helping victims’ family members and making public opinion vulnerable”.
“They are naturally indignant and honestly shared by everyone, these kinds of tragedies, because of their size, attract the attention of the media and the public, but in reality we are confronted with dramatic, recurring cases every day,” he said.
Napolitano openly admits: "We are undoubtedly facing a shortage of resources, and funding for education and information is crucial.
In-school initiatives aimed at directly educating young people on the verge of entering the world of work are of paramount importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in this phenomenon, not to let the social importance of this issue diminish, and we need more effective legislation that needs to be enforced.
The president of the House of Commons, Gianfranco Fini, said: “The grave social significance of workplace accidents that result in death weighs on the conscience of all of us, and the institutions are required to put an end to it as soon as possible.”
“Occupational accident data show a slight improvement, but the number of such deaths is still astonishingly high,” said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
“We don’t want this decreasing trend to be accompanied by a declining attention, because the biggest tragedies happen when attention is lowered.”
"We believe that, at a general level, we are still not doing everything we can to tackle this phenomenon through a complex programme of action.
We believe that stricter supervision and control is needed, Mr Mercandelli stressed, as well as stronger intervention in the field of workforce training, starting with school education."
“More efforts are also needed to inform and make the public more responsive,” he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment against a phenomenon that poses a social problem.”
Mercandelli then criticized the "gradual deterioration of the compensation net for victims of accidents at work" and the "relief trend towards which the system has been drifting in recent years."
“The aim is, therefore, to restore to the workers the security afforded by insurance, because the fate of those who have suffered an accident cannot depend on the arbitrary and distributive measures of the legislators.”
MP3 Players Can Cause Hearing Loss
Persistent hearing loss can be caused by listening to portable playback devices for longer periods of time and at high volume, such as MP3s.
In a report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) has today published an opinion.
"The study shows that between 5 and 10 percent of people who listen to their portable music players for more than an hour a day for five years with a high volume can suffer permanent hearing loss," the study said.
"It's worrying that young people who use high-volume portable music players and mobile phones on a massive scale are not aware that they can cause irreversible damage to their hearing," said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undeniable risk that we urgently need to respond to," he added.
The most important task is to inform and disseminate information to consumers on a wide scale.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review the existing control systems so that they can operate efficiently and keep up with the latest technologies."
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in the light of the prevalence of portable music players and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise they cause.
"Researchers confirm that we have cause for concern, and the European Commission is ready to explore, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, possible measures to protect children and young people exposed to noise from portable players and similar devices," said the commissioner.
The current European safety standard sets the maximum sound level emitted by portable music players at 100 dB, but there is an increasing concern about hearing loss data due to the excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise exposure, that can significantly reduce these hearing impairments.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee states that users of portable music players who listen to music at high volumes (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week have noise exposures that exceed the current maximum level of noise at work.
If a person listens to music for a long time under similar conditions, after five years there is a risk of permanent hearing loss.
This affects around 5-10% of mobile device users, which could amount to between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno to set up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, runs until March, and results are expected in June.
This is the schedule set by the Municipality of Budapest for the operation of the "Future of the capital of Rome" committee, which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the spas of Caracalla.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work on the Rome guidelines.
Following the closing words in March, the study and the plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and the Local Government Committee, so that the strategic plan of the capital city, officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno, can be submitted in June.
“This is a completely independent commission, in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented,” Alemanno said, “and it is up to us to formulate proposals for Rome’s development ideas on which political decision-makers, such as the General Assembly and the Local Government Commission, can rely.”
We are not talking about any conflict of competence, we just wanted a platform where big plans for the good of Rome can be made.
In March, after completing its work, the committee will be dissolved because it has a fixed-term mandate.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the “Future of the seated capital of Rome” committee, the Mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission's work superfluous, on the grounds that its opinion is not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work the Commission will do and the quality of the proposals it will put on the table.
If the standard proves to be adequate, as in France in the case of the Attali Committee, which I am certain of in the case of Rome, the contribution it makes will play an important role.
The power of politics is often fragmented in the management of day-to-day affairs, as well as in the handling of urgent cases that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, look further, taking into account perspectives, and plan for the longer term, and are committed to working for Rome’s development and future.”
The mayor of Rome would like to state that "this Commission cannot be considered a useless 'head of water' because it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro, but it will serve as an incentive to think and seek to involve the finest minds of the capital."
According to Alemanno, “we need an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that will allow our city to take the high-quality leap that it so needs, thinking together about its future.”
On the future that the mayor of Rome emphasises, "it will not only be confined to the current municipal framework, but will look much further", we see in it not only the future metropolis and the status of the capital, but also "the role that it can and must play as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known, self-proclaimed American politician wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
Jimmy Carter was the first to destroy the U.S. economy with his decisions and to maintain close ties (as he does today as a private person) with hostile Islam.”
As the election time approaches, attacks on Obama are escalating.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambition.
“Obama, in arrogance, believes he can win the highest public dignity of a nation that has so far had a total of two governors and five senators black.”
These attacks are, in fact, meaningless; they are, of course, racist, but they do not answer the voters' question of whether he will be a good president.
In this case, too, there are those who listen to their emotions, not their minds.
Inside the southern states, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in an editorial: “We know very well that in the polling booth the true American patriot casts his vote for whom.”
A side of the American way of thinking appears here that has remained hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk what you want, and we'll know where to put the ix, Obama or McCain."
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
Such words have never been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush himself.
Did they ask 1,500 people what mistakes they made during Bush’s time in office? 89 percent said they were Iraqi.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was so tilted to the bottom that it flew home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed and Americans did not have to pack.
The majority, however, believe that Iraq was Bush’s weakness.
It’s a huge task for George W. to take over.
The United States: the economic collapse is already felt by journalists, the time for austerity has come in the editorial offices. Many blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW research institute interviewed 500 American journalists about their views on the future status and intellectual power of their profession.
Well, right now, almost every journalist is pessimistic about their own future.
However, it was not clearly stated that their concerns about credibility had diminished.
They don’t feel as isolated as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
In their view, the 2008 crisis is a failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on the newsroom, i.e. newspaper editorials.
If we do not want traditional journalism to shrink to a minimum in the sense that it is understood by the general public, this problem must be solved, the journalists interviewed say.
Today, American journalism is characterized by visible and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of print journalists and senior executives are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
It is not difficult for the press to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishers are pushing their way to the Internet, which many consider to be the “murderer” of the printed press.
The “economic pressure” perceived by journalists increased to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists surveyed admitted that they would vote for technology in the hope that it might benefit journalism.
Today, in the U.S. press industry, there is a gap between the editorial directors, i.e., the directors, and the correspondents who work for them.
At the national level, 56 percent of leaders are confident that their correspondents will share their information with others, while at the local level, this figure is only 23 percent.
Some associate this with a secure job.
At national level, 47% of executives fear losing their jobs within three years.
For journalists, this is 30%.
In America, the issue of "safe work" is constantly on the agenda at the team level (in the case of our editors, editors).
Only 13% of journalists have contracts.
In a vast nation such as the United States, with its 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet service providers, employers usually offer as much as they want, so it works on a "should or shouldn't" basis.
Directors usually receive high salaries, and editors can earn up to <0x24>10,000 a month, in addition to paying pension and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, on the other hand, operates on a rather complicated principle: in the first year x days, in the third also, until after a certain time it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own admissions, often get “sick” during the year.
Everything depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROMAN COURT: DANILO COPPOLA GROTAFERRATA BASED
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Division of the Court of Rome, rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, a real estate agent, who wanted to move from his residence in Grottaferrata to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for economic bankruptcy in the context of the Unipol-BNL share exchange agreement.
Last week, during the proceeding against him, the house arrest was lifted and changed to a residence ban for Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate professional move from a small rural town to his apartment in the capital.
However, according to the court, these commutes (for which the prosecutor made a negative proposal) would allow him to influence the company’s affairs and gain access to the evidence brought against him.
The elite is at risk.
The phenomenon was already felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives refused to vote in favour of the <0x24>700 billion bailout proposed by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested, and still are interested, in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which reports that the current crisis has created a breakthrough within the Republican Party, which is showing an increasing division between the traditional, restrained attitude of support for federal institutions and business circles on the East Coast and the growing anti-Washington and anti-financial world stance in the central and southern states.
This has been demonstrated in a critical way in the House vote mentioned in the introduction.
However, this event is only one of the major changes that the economic transformation that is still taking place is predicting or allowing to be seen, not only in the United States, but in the entire Western world, and perhaps even beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, is only accelerating the long-standing latent phenomena that are consolidating in this new atmosphere and are finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-actualization, the re-establishment of the dual category of state sovereignty in connection with a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is affecting those banking and financial institutions that, although they have close ties with the rest of the world, are primarily, and on a fairly large scale, attracting people and families who live in a single country, a single state.
This, in turn, presents a direct political difficulty for those in government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those who are also electors.
So, in economic terms, the crisis appears to be global, but in political terms it is almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially stranded off the coast: the European Union is an eloquent proof of this, which is unable to establish a unified political line between different interests and different national strategies.
So everyone expects the intervention, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules from the individual national governments, but most of all the opening of the funds: because in a situation of need, only the individual states have the economic resources, the financial resources, which may be able to put things in order.
They have the means and the authority to use them: under the circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that probably no other market and no international organisation will ever have to this extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on the nation-state is fully in line with the fact that the recent economic growth places increasing importance on a factor that is closely related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of networking, increasingly sophisticated technology, and that the global financial world was destined to dominate the world, we suddenly had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on less abstract things like water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, but can still be completely connected to a definite place, an area.
So the one who controls the area has far more cards than the one who, unfortunately, was born in a place where there is no crops, no oil, and no water.
I would like to move on to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of fracture line.
Whoever says territory, state, government, must also say politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two conflicting phenomena:
On the one hand, an objective recognition of the need for authentic leadership, by someone who can take control of events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially the economic leaders, who have proved to be totally inadequate and have proved that there are still many obscure areas ahead of them, has brought about a complete loss of credibility.
Together, the two are of even deeper significance and, in a sense, more troubling: a sense of loss of credit, impatience, incompetence, and detachment that affects the entire leadership elite in an increasing number of Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that there is a growing belief among the population that the age of the social elite, which is at its peak, is over. It has expired before their actions, experiences, lifestyles, cultures, in the complex sense of the word, were adopted. Thus, the social elite is increasingly alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In a word, the demand for leadership, in a veiled form, fuels a diversified but strong delegitimation movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This is manifested in the unexpected "rebellions" of voters, or in recent times in the sudden changes in the mood against the public.
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, programs, and even with its habits, press and famous intellectuals, is less and less able to understand and, therefore, less and less able to represent what has been going on for some time in the deeper layers of Western society.
Despite all this, speaking of the “imminent rebellion of the masses” is, frankly, an exaggeration.
But walking with your eyes open isn't bad at all.
You can walk with super strong glue on the wall
Using a super-strong adhesive to overcome gravity and walk the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal has been set by several US research centers, and a group of four institutions is close to finding a solution.
With just 2.5 square centimeters of adhesive, the researchers were able to glue a 100-pound body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American journal STUDY - A Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists was born from the further development of previously existing special materials with a so-called carbon nanotube structure.
“The principle of operation of the adhesive should be conceived as a package of spaghetti-like piping,” says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers drew the idea from the gecko’s leg covered with microscopic folds, providing the animal with perfect traction.
Tests with materials such as glass, teflon, and abrasive paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the soles of the said reptiles, while at the same time "easily detaching from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton School of Engineering.
"This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Can we walk on the wall just like Spider-Man? Maybe, but researchers are thinking of a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes conduct heat and electricity well.
You can also find other applications in the field of space research.
Superheroes can wait.
The other research - Berkeley University in California is also experimenting with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in the journal American Chemical Society, California scientists have demonstrated a hair-like microfiber adhesive that undergoes self-cleaning when moving on the surface, providing perfect adhesion at all times.
Medications? No fruit juice!
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These high-vitamin drinks, which are popular in the summer, if taken with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, increasing or decreasing their effect, depending on the case. This can also have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, pointed out the risks of taking canned or fresh juices with certain medications. The professor announced at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medications, preventing their beneficial effects on the health of the patient.
Grapefruit juice has already been put on the accused’s bench when it was found to be able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety-reducing, heart rhythm-regulating and neuropharmaceuticals to levels considered toxic.
Two years ago, the Italian Pharmaceutical Institute itself published the news in its official gazette and warned doctors and patients to take the risks associated with this co-administration seriously and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of drugs.
The list of active substances whose absorption is hindered by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be long.
Michele Carruba, professor of pharmaceuticals at the Milan State University, said: “Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutions, who, if necessary, will ensure that the information contained in the product information is changed.
That’s why you should always read the leaflet of the medicine you are going to take and if something is not understandable, don’t let yourself be influenced, but clearly ask your doctor or pharmacist,” said the specialist at the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman wins Nobel Prize in Economics
The American Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his analysis of the territorial contexts of commercial models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old Neo-Keynesian Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the strongest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the latter event would have even more crucial consequences for U.S. history than the collapse of the twin towers.
This prediction has caused a lot of controversy, it has been criticized several times by the economist, but we now know that it was accurate.
“I’m surprised, and a little shocked, at how quickly public interest overwhelmed the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the European Central Bank executive committee, Krugman is a "bravely valuable economist," but he also "distributes in a rather aggressive manner his criticisms of the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, the third edition of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0, an open-source application suite that enhances personal productivity, is launching as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, targeting a growing range of layers, from home to office users, from freelancers to administrators.
After nearly a year of SUN Microsystem-managed work by volunteer developers, the new Open Office comes to the public with several novelties: in addition to the welcome screen and a redesigned, less Spartan user interface, it also offers several essential novelties, such as compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ISO-standard ODF (Open Document 1.2) format.
Particular attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007 so that Open Office can open Microsoft documents with new extensions (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting also are the specific features of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files by email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into the graphical module, while keeping the page layout.
In the same interface, you can create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or word processing elements.
Sharing within apps has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet supports the shared use of workbooks, but prevents overwriting each other’s work. Each employee’s comments are colored differently, which helps to make them easier to recognize during the verification phase.
Some companies are already working on making some of OpenOffice’s features available from the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html.
The package is available for Linux in addition to standard Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
On request, you can receive the installation CD at home or at work.
In terms of the home app’s spread, it’s probably the most appealing, but the Open Office suite is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector as it can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no shortage of training, consulting and service services that are ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business prospects.
Open Office consists of five core modules: Writer, a word-based word processor; Calc, a spreadsheet designed to replace Excel; Impress, Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase is the most well-known, similar to Access Database Manager; and finally Draw is the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads. But if you take into account that we are already at 3,600,000 with the release of the new version, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
At the last stage of the Tour de France, the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed for the Gerolsteiner team, once again produced a positive pattern and won the bronze medal as well as the top mountaineer jersey.
The news came to light on the Equipe website.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth driver, after Italian Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepol, and German Gerolsteiner Stefan Schumacher, who scored a positive result in the Cera test, which is considered the third generation version of the EPO.
Kohl’s blood samples, like the tests that have been carried out in recent weeks, were tested by labs in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control tests confirm a positive Cera result, the Austrian loses his third place and is banned from racing for two years.
The news of Kohl’s third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and told the Associated Press that he had signalled a positive doping result to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian managed to stand on the podium behind Carlos Sastre of Spain and Cadel Evans of the United States and also won the polka dots of the best mountaineers.
INTRODUCTORS: DOES NEW YORK TIMES ASK THE QUESTION, ITALY’S RACIST?
Italy has only recently changed from an immigrant country to one of the favourite destinations for reluctant immigrants.
This question is being raised by the New York Times, which, based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre of Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits, dedicates a long article to the controversy about racism in Italy.
The case characterizes what the New York Times calls the “northern paradox”: “the strongest integration and the highest employment” in the northern regions, but also “anti-immigration and support for the Northern League” are the strongest in the country.
In support of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also cites cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the reins of immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, were also discussed as an example of a change of mood in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic underlined this trend: “He met with Benedict Giorgio Napolitano XVI at Quirinale Palace and suggested that the State and the Church should work together to combat racism.”
Students suffer from expensive rents, a room can cost up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>900
The housing market for college students is not affected by the crisis.
According to a recent survey by the Sunia, Homeowners’ Union, a student can pay up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>900 for a single room in Milan, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>700 in Florence, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>650 in Naples and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has now reached such a staggering extent that, due to the huge total cost to families, it has shut out a wide range of students from learning,” explains Laura Mariani, head of the study office at Sunia. “The high demand from students in these cities has distorted the market to such an extent that a general costing process has also begun against local residents.”
In most cases, the property offers also contain a number of irregularities: unregistered, non-rental-limited contracts with a linked apartment.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be needed to allow for price caps through a review of the tax system.
The survey reveals that in Milan, around Brianza, the price of a single room ranges from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>650 (near Bande Nere) to an average of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 (near Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but can also reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>900 (near Vittoria).
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where most students live near the university, a bed costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>250/280 for a double room and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>370-500 for a single room.
In Rome, areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are charged about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600 for a single bed and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>450 for a double bed.
Slightly cheaper (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>550 for a single room) prices around other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
In suburban districts, you can save some money: it costs 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are charged for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The price range is highest in the area of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you pay 250/350 euros for a bed and at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent a greater weight within the urban budget.
In cities like Perugia, where students from outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is about 25 to 30 percent higher than that charged to Italian tenants.
Goodbye, old Cinema Paradiso, the days of the old cinemas are over in the cities
Traditional cinemas are closing in favor of Multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas, a blind city, is like a face without eyes.”
The pictures taken by director Giuseppe Tornatore are an impressive representation of what is happening in Italian cities, but also in rural areas.
The displacement of cinemas - the appearance of large, multi-room cinemas in the suburbs, and consequently the atrophy of one-room cinemas in city centers - seems inevitable and irreversible, but at the same time bears all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, "it's like a friend who's gone, a acquaintance with whom we shared our journey and many experiences," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which was an Oscar 20 years ago, as well as the Grand Prix of the Cannes Festival for Tornatore, is lost after all a lyrical story of a small-town cinema, perhaps, a story of longing
The figures published by Anec, the largest association of operators, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed. The biggest losses were recorded by cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna, which has lost 82 one-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the fact that multiplexes are the cause of their disappearance is no better evidence than the fact that in these three regions of Italy, the number of newly opened multi-room cinemas is the highest: in the last five years, the number of rooms in Lombardy has increased by 195, in Tuscany by 81 and in Emilia-Romagna by the same amount.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says Anec President Paolo Protti. "It is okay to build new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of the existing ones, because when a city cinema closes, not all of the passageways are willing to go through multiplexes.
Not to mention the unfilled financial funds to support operators: the overdue debt of the State is estimated at around EUR 10 million.
It is both ethically and morally disgraceful that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
It would require between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million a year to maintain the market.”
It is the first Italian city, concerned about closures, that has decided to remedy the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and boost one-room cinemas in the outer and inner city.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators, as well as benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can enter restricted areas and park at reduced rates in certain parking lots.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even with other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas need to improve sound and image quality in order to be able to fight the dominance of multiplexes, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the spark that made me finally do Cinema Paradiso, even though I’ve been thinking about it for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to Via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale to not see the blackened posters, I turn my head.
Close ties between politics and 'ndrangheta, mayor of Gioia Tauro arrested
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions.”
The judges of the Mafia Directorate in Calabria have made serious accusations against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on charges of external involvement in a criminal network.
Gioacchino Piromallio, the senior mediator between the clan and the administration, and a nephew of a lawyer of the same name as the chief, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mafia-like criminal conspiracy, was also handcuffed and charged with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million compensation.
"Ignorance of all legal and moral rules, even of good taste," state prosecutors write. The two local governments have declared their intention to pay counseling fees to Piromalli's lawyer.
"So the clan would have formally had access to the city hall, which would have provided additional opportunities to control and direct the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the General Assembly of the Calabria region, does not hide the fact that in the region "there are numerous collusions between local institutions and the organized underworld": There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes who stay clean."
The arrests this morning are a continuation of the events in July, when police announced that they had succeeded in beheading the Piromalmi clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to administer the municipality. The municipal committee of Gioia Tauro was dissolved once in 1991, even after alleged mergers between organised crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian-Democratic mayor at the time of the dissolution, took the lead of the centre-right coalition in the second round of 2006.
He called out a scandal when the County Hall ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
Marco Minnini, then deputy interior minister, was summoned to court, accusing him of plotting everything for political purposes, but the court, in a warrant signed this morning, explained that the Pyromall clan had dared to demand a change to the A3 project.
The wiretap ordered against Dal Torrione reveals, state prosecutors write, that "it was inclined to meet the demands of an entrepreneur representing an extensive group known to be close to the Piromalli family, to subordinate the decisions of the municipality to the clan's interests."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come
An inexhaustible source of energy that accounts for 70 percent of the planet’s surface and is still being discovered by major international energy companies.
Waves, ocean currents, tides, all renewable energy sources that giants like Chevron have been looking for and are now trying to get their hands on it.
For a hundred years, they've been researching how to extract energy from the movements of the sea, and in the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research was intensifying.
Around 1980, when oil prices fell, the idea of exploiting offshore energy was put aside, but today the demand for environmental protection and the re-emergence of oil prices give the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by installations that utilize the waves of the sea.
This is twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
Giants are on the rise.
Enersis was the first company to commit to offshore energy and in 2005 signed an agreement for a power plant in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are opting for marine energy, including those who have been committed to conventional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies and is considering working with us," a spokesperson for an affiliate of the U.S. oil giant, the Wall Street Journal, said in a statement.
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit issued by the U.S. Energy Commission to launch a project in Alaska for the exploitation of marine energy.
This is of no small importance, especially considering that the US is currently producing oil in Alaska, and President Bush has just launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey are also on the path to energy from the sea. The amount invested so far, as far as the details are known, is proving to be of growing interest.
Technology is waiting to be developed.
According to experts, it is still a rudimentary technology, only because the energy from the sea does not dispel doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities, such as those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small in size and therefore do not pose too much of a problem for the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce energy on a larger scale, we need facilities that also have a greater impact on the environment.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses an interconnected buoy system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving the buoys up and down are transformed into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure rotates a turbine, which feeds a generator.
Electricity flows to land via cables under the sea.
At the moment, there are four similar facilities in the planning phase, which are only waiting for federal approval, and part of the energy generated would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started generating power for a shopping mall and a parking lot with six submarine turbines located in the East River Strait of New York.
At tides, the movement of water rotates the turbine blades, and this rotational movement feeds the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of partners who are just waiting for the necessary permits to use energy.
Waves after tides.
At present, the opportunities that can be exploited through the tides deserve special attention.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and can therefore be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, spent <0x24>7.5 million in 2008, which is expected to increase to <0x24>35 million in 2009.
