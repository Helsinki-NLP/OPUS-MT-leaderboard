Rapidly progressive cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare more for an outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who will need care and, mainly, intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, the COVID-19 evolves into a more severe disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compared them with those of Hubei Province in China.
We also compared the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with that of Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, the COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world now follow that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths only in Italy.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of notified cases of COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8am.
These data were used to assess trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare them to those of Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of cases of COVID-19, taking into account, therefore, the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases notified by each country until March 15, 2020 at 8 a.m., and compare it with Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom generally followed those of Hubei Province in China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and increased significantly, then around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar increases in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This occurs despite the fact that countries are in different stages, the variations in the actions of the national public health systems and, possibly, different case definitions in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that should be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for updating.
In early March 2020, physicians in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization for cases of COVID-19 in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 inhabitants between 2010 and 2011).
Modeled scenarios related to saturation of health system capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the United Kingdom of the prevalence of cases of hospitalization due to COVID-19 associated with a higher risk of 90% of intensive treatment bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Given that cases have so far focused on certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and intensive treatment beds should be made available preferably in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare for a sustainable community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical care, especially intensive treatment, such as that occurring in affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid expected increase in the number of cases may not offer sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions properly, if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility of intensifying their control initiatives to decrease the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure in the health system.
If they fail in these initiatives, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The epidemic of Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Coronavirus 2 disease (SARS-CoV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80 thousand in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, the COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than the SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive evaluation of the research object, which develops rapidly.
We will address the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help to understand and eradicate this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to remain confined on the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to coronavirus (CoV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs) in 2003; therefore, it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the respective disease was called CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and nearly 50 other countries worldwide.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients killed.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number one," and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequencing of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article aims to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Whenever relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as the other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have found highly pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV epidemic in the documented human history.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1, a portion of cases of pneumonia with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan, on December 31, 2019, to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequencing was published.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to the cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the contagion of health professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transportation interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of onset of contagion by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a worldwide health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig. 2).
As the situation worsens rapidly, the scale and the final severity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a study of several centers with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, especially in the 30 to 65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, some were under 20, and only 14 infected were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The COVID-19 spread into groups, especially in Hubei and its surroundings.
The COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The basic number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people grew exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the massive transportation time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera, namely: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect humans.
The glycoprotein spike (S) of the envelope binds to its cellular receptors of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and, in sequence, membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles that contain virions, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original outbreak site, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrafine sections of the epithelium of the human airways.
It has been found that human ECA2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein S binds to human protein ECA2 weaker than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On February 18, 2020 Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of the human ECA2 of total length to the resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can unite two S proteins, which provides evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs of SARS-like bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross species' barriers and infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes transport the virus from bats to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, elongated snout mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the 99% genetic homology between a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% in two genomes is a great difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence are being awaited (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are mostly unknown yet.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are efficient in deactivation of the virus.
Overall, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can consult only previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptor (TLR), NOD-type receptor (NLR) and RIG-I-type receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N can help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help in the defense of cells.
However, CoV may inhibit the functions of T-cells by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including complements such as antibodies C3a and C5a, is also essential for the fight against viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects more the elderly with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a greater chance of being infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and mostly 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most precise incubation period, thus preventing infected people who do not present symptoms from transmitting the virus to other people.
As a current practice, individuals exposed to or infected by the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, vertigo, headache, sore throat, flushing, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients developed rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in lung imaging diagnosis, should undergo screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family grouping and a cluster with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that patients from MERS-CoV also presented fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of the patients required ventilatory support, much more than the patients of COVID-19, which consists of higher mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, it was demonstrated that fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40%), diarrhea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
Until February 14, the mortality of the COVID-19 was 2%, when the confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Comparatively, the mortality of SARS up to November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with their symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV epidemic and the SARS-CoV epidemic.
The appearance of symptoms in a grouping of people usually happens in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and cured patients who have been discharged from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm to prolong the quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral blood white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count below 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer level, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count showed progressive reduction.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are present in most patients with COVID-19, and present bilateral irregular shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute damage to the lungs and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely compromise gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most severe chest X-ray results usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumotic membranes, the formation of hyaline membranes, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was not derived only from RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to reach an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the HERLOLK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 x 10-18 mol/L at 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre of input) using a measuring rod in less than one hour, without the need for a complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians can provide, in the best of their ability, palliative treatment for patients of COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have been used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, cured patient plasma, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running out of time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high-flow oxygenation, noninvasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technique used for the treatment of severe cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine cascade results from the exacerbated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat the cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for the cytokine cascade include modulation of the immune response directed to T cells; IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF block; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; cytokine signaling suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, drastically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of low to moderate dose corticosteroid treatment were recommended for cautious use in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy was confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound to China to perform some tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being greatly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and antibody generation
The blood collection of patients who have healed from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from the contraction of the disease has a long history.
In fact, cured patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who healed from COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in severe condition.
Its symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the large-scale method before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate excess immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a worldwide epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or to screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, MTC, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend enormously on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on CMD theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or are vague, since it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, MTC has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it has been found that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in treating COVID-19.
The best cure rates of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China who used ERM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used ERM in only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and co-workers published a comparative study between exclusive treatment with Western medicine and combined treatment of Western medicine with MTC.
It was found that the times necessary for the recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were considerably shorter in the group treated by Western medicine and MTC than only in the group treated by Western medicine.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by Western medicine and MTC than for the group treated only by Western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by Western medicine and MTC than in the group treated only by Western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of the ERM still await further controlled tests at larger scales and at more centers.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of the ERM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease are generally very afraid of the highly contagious disease and may be fatal, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
Moreover, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, symptoms of psychosis, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
Contact tracking and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health system actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to people suspected of the disease and to those who had contact with them, as well as to the population in general, who is in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to stop the chain of transmission of animal reservoirs and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives have been taken to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the lethal challenge models and their protection from zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before the start of a clinical study.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions, due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months, on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, the COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to present underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive care (mean age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the outcome in health of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to suffer acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also join positive ECA2 cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have strong correlation and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and was proposed as a potential prognostic factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
Correlation of CRP level with severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are present in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunctions.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues for predicting outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants usually used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dosage and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they undergo long periods of quarantine and uncertainties, and witness the death of loved members of the family and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics of SARS characteristics.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the initial phase of infection (or cause only mild symptoms), similarly to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients in the initial phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are severely ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Major efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population, hoping to disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic will end by March, and the deceleration phase will last between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of the world population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and middle turbinate smears of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new virus identified may become a cyclic influenza-like episode.
However, promising evidences occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that the current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally kept under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker as to its infectivity and at some point become a less pathogenic virus co-existent with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS epidemic and MERS epidemic is found below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by coughing and sneezing and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which creates a new possibility: oral-fecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, co-workers and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and breathing masks N95 (Series No. 1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected individual from being transported into the air or from being adhered to the surfaces of the objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only the N95 masks (series n. 1860s) protect against inhalation of viriums with a size of 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate it completely; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and the two are approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health professionals in direct contact with patients should wear the N95 masks (series n. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should use isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
The viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing a mask N95; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health professionals should also wear transparent facial protectors or protective goggles when attending patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than usual, try to stay at home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
One meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection, as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a major alert to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on January 19, 2020 the director of Wuhan's Center for Disease Control reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of contagion and limited reproducibility among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the containment of the disease in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from hospitals, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its initial stage, rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) issue more often targeted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and test and improve the society's response system periodically.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a sensation of return of SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
The COVID-19 affects older adults more than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in the elderly than in the young.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are severely ill, which causes greater difficulty in containing the propagation of COVID-19 than of SARS.
This explains, in parts, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of virus spread.
Given the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a genetic homologue of 96% was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat CoVs similar to SARS, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates in bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to Questions Nos 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 unites with ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in the other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission between humans?
Will it become a worldwide pandemic, disappear like SARS, or have seasonal recurrence, like flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to look for answers to the above questions and so many others.
However, regardless of the necessary efforts, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Human coronavirus zoonotic origin
Mutation and adaptation boosted coevolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human CoVs (HCoVs) caused a mild illness, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) changed what was thought about the CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating a HCV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 highlighted the CoVS again and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother SARS-CoV.
HCV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCVs is of enormous use.
Most of the HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
The investigation of the host interactions of the CoV in animals can also provide important information about the pathogenesis of the CoV in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information on the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we compare and contrast different HCVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and genome recombination.
The current disease epidemic by CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of encapsulated viruses with positive polarity and simple tape RNA.
These viruses that present the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed under an electron microscope.
As for the structure, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two overlapping open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into replication polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessory proteins are also encoded by different CoVs strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, the CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the genus betaCoV contains most of the HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed species' barriers, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, the HCoV-229E and the HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronary virus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the choriza of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating today and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new CV of 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current epidemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm's ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that's coming.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of HCVs provides a structure to understand natural history, driving force, and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and the pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that HcoVs parental viruses are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the trend of evolution of HCV, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of the B814 strain of the HCoV-229E from the coryza of patients who contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was later adapted for growth in pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the culture of organs and subsequent serial passage in brains of mice during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
The HCoV-229E and the HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
Overall, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCV in human history, and the etiologic agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "supersparators", it was estimated that each contaminated person can contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the onset of peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients need intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation at some point.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of patient zero traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on the HCoV.
The HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was found that the virus was prevalent in small children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of choriz, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered all over the world.
It was estimated that the HCV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, the HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, it was reported that HCoV-HKU1 was associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
In the same way that the HCoV-NL63, the HCoV-229E and the HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All these four community-acquired HCVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported as causing severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar for MERS, among diseases caused by HCV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 cases confirmed by laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases, of 34.4%, which made MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
From half to the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which were retrospectively known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continuous epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 an Emergency of Public Health of International Importance and also named the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a crude mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the lethality related to the confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside this city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, in the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
Firstly, the incubation period and duration of evolution of HCV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four community-acquired HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most frequently observed during community-acquired HCV infection, including the presence of non-specific, mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns in both Community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, in the same way as the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies whether the oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can exhibit seasonality, as in cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after its passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All community-acquired HCVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop severe diseases of HCVs have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic stays, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If the adaptation is adequate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in human populations, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to humans, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to remain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seize the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as the community-acquired HCoVs, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired and less pathogenic HCVs than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of the HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of the HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of a HCV if it houses a direct relationship ancestor, sharing high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host houses the HCoV in a continuous and lasting way.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the HcoV or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if the HCV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or close to its introduction to humans, it does not adapt adequately to the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
A HCV may have interrupted the infection if it cannot sustain its transmission to the intermediate host.
On the other hand, the HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the patient zero from SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent investigations of seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in the live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the slaughter of all civets on the markets.
However, it has been reported that wild masked palm civets or farms without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could only be the intermediate host amplifier, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals can serve as intermediate hosts SARS-CoV amplifiers cannot be excluded.
All these animals appear to be SARS-CoV terminal hosts.
Subsequent search for SARS-CoV's natural animal host revealed a narrow-relation bat CoV, named Rhinolophus bat CoV (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese ferral bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoV, except for the so-called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) of humans is the SARS-CoV receptor.
It has been shown that WIV1 derived from fecal samples of bats uses ECA2 of bats, civets and humans as a receptor for entry into cells.
It is intriguing that the serum of convalescent patients from SARS was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the ancestor with closer relationship to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groups the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of bats and the CoV-HKU5 of bats.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA polymerase sequences dependent on RNA from MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in beta-CoVs of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, CoV-HKU25 of bats, share only 87% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralization antibodies, in the same way as camels from the Middle East in several African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nose smears of dromedaries, increased evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that generally mild symptoms, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in camels infected experimentally with the MERS-CoV.
It is remarkable that the infected camels transmit the viruses not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus transmission in bats.
However, there are still no answers, since many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which can be attributed, in a plausible way, to the transmission between people or transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that house the MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical bat CoVs are discovered in the future.
The intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are assumed to be among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Sea Fruit Attack Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely event of animal transmission to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbor ancestral betacovs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new Pangolim CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to RaTG13, with about 90% of identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They group into SARS-CoV-2-like virus underlines in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In a huge contrast, the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, although they have a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study on sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual curation to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to approximately 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of the SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolin due to the divergence in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and the betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs of the pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the betacoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest large genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of the betaCoVs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 stems from convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
An opposing argument relates to the recombination between betaCoV of SARS-CoV-2-related pangolins and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is very present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCVs, the zoonotic origin of the HCV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both the HCoV-NL63 and the HCoV-229E could have originated from bat CoVs, while the parenting viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and the HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
It has been reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the American tricolor bat had a direct relationship with the HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and it is also suspected that camels are their intermediate hosts.
For greater clarity, the current knowledge about the animal origins of known HCOVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for events of interspecies transmission of HCoVs throughout history.
When the HCoV-OC43 crossed the species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E were discovered.
Among them, there's an alphacoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, but not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, the alphaCoVs of bats related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alphaCoV of alpacas caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphaCoV of alpacas was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCOV-229E-related alphaCoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries for humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by later results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, high density colonies, narrow social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral spreader".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV in dromedaries dates back to decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and supports a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and humans remain terminal hosts of the MERS-CoV, since their transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, is different.
Specifically, pangolin betacoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be a terminal host for SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs, similar to civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the host reservoir of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological niche with bats by slaughtering or coal mines.
Secondly, the pangolins could be one of the intermediate hosts amplifiers, in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had just been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by slaughtering and consuming game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating the coVs cross species barriers.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single tape RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered from "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year per location, depending on the adaptation phase of the CoV to the new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir suppresses CoV replication by inhibiting RNA-dependent exorribonuclease and RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of the CoVs are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the mutation rate is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is low, apparently, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he's already adapted to another host who keeps in touch with human beings.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts an extra plasticity in the modification of the genome to mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and protein functions encoded in relation to the last three inches of the genome end.
Third, the CoVs switch models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique "copying" mechanism.
In a host serving as a mixing container, tape exchange occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in the HCoV-HKU1 and in the HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal covs, such as the SL-CoV of bats and the batcoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between SARS-CoV isolates of human beings and civets, SARS-CoV is believed to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in S protein DLR.
In general, DLR in the protein S of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in amino acids 318o to 510o in fragment S1, which binds to human ECA2, as well as its correceptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV DLR is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including bats, civets, mice and guaxin dogs, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral and civet isolates in the DLR, and four of them are located in the reason for binding to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV of civets has K479N and S487T mutations in their DLR, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit implies that the binding affinity of your S protein with human ACE2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomicroscopy indicates a 10 to 20 times greater affinity of this bond than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other co-receptor may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that the HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of protein S.
There are several other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCoV-OC43.
They could also answer for the effective adaptation of these CoVs in humans after the interspecies transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence with the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors to an effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-biased screening with genome range of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
New HCoVs emergence: back to square one
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also boost the evolution of HCV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, it is believed that ORF8 is important in its adaptation to humans, since the bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was found that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A nucleotide 29 exclusion characteristic of SARS-CoVs was found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
Exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs strains, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and nsp14 parts.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV underwent recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which the HCoVs recombine with other CoVs of animals in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, probably resulting from the relief of the selection pressure exerted on viruses, such as the pressure of the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alphaCoV of alpacas presents a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in the frames.
Finally, but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when they were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bats are likely to be well adapted to anatomical and physiological CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminator cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the NKG2/CD94 natural exterminator receptor, and the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ERO) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can either suppress the replication of CoV or affect the revision by exorribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or at most cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without causing a high host immune response.
This document describes the discovery of asymptomatic patients and the cause of severe cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine cascade, in which the higher the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic patients, the immune response was disconnected from CoV replication.
The same strategy of disconnection of the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it has been discovered that bat betaCoV shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a bat CoV that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in the markets harbor viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, have been discovered, indicating that pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or the betaCoVs of pangolins can contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by man accidentally or intentionally.
The CoVs have returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of the CoVs in bats and other animals dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCVs in human transmission.
Evidence of widespread diffusion shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in the bat and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from the contact between humans and civets in the markets, the closing of damp markets and the slaughter of civets in these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from damp markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple strains of pangolin betacovs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through the pangolins and other mammals, and the mode of such transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and they are an essential source of meat, milk, leather, and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as it was done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crisis, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there's a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for people to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parenting viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the infection of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide conveys our experience and constitutes a good reference for fighting this worldwide pandemic.
However, the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge increase gradually based on the constant discoveries of research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment about our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guides for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially called the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus is called the Coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted excellent attention since the publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge increase gradually based on the constant discoveries of research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guides for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020 have a total of seven issues with substantial changes in the context in some.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple scoring proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this worldwide pandemic.
We endorse your meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, your work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guides for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of the elements of epidemiological history with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to fulfill three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and from nearby areas or from other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (greater or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces, such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging diagnostic resources of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on suspicious case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity in relation to the new known coronaviruses; (3) positive for specific IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in serum examination; or any change in the specific IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or titer increase greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
Real-time PCR for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples was added to the second and third editions (January 18 and 22, 2020, respectively).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples was added to the fourth and fifth edition (January 27, 2020 and February 8, 2020, respectively), and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an ideal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us to pay attention to symptomatic and asymptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated because it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more studies and clinical practices.
To conclude, we expect the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that you check and comply with the latest guidelines of your countries of origin.
Our team will also timely update our guide to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, largest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases registered included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
On an online newscast, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of COVID-19 on March 11.
One hospital agent told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video online communiqué, Bengali minister of road transport and Obaidul Quader bridges said that public transport would be paralyzed for longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
This stoppage of public transportation began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still permitted.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections in the world
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infections SARS-CoV-2 in the world rose from one million, indicated data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea stated that by Thursday it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10h at the Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the USA caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until 1 May.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without attending work until April 30.
The parliament of Portugal voted to extend the state of emergency in 15 days. The vote was passed by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew to the entire day in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to implement curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Shops in Australia reduce toilet paper limits by transaction
On Saturday and Sunday night, Australian stores networks Woolworths and Coles reduced the restrictions on buying toilet paper, respectively, to two packages and one package per transaction in every store in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a package limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Out of fear of COVID-19, buyers were supposed to be stockpiling in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of toilet paper with home delivery to a package per order.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that, even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still running out of stocks within an hour of delivery" and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI called it "unexpected" on a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had a "stunning increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco's shop in Canberra also limited the amount allowed for two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made available in advance stocks of a planned promotion for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Retailers, said retailers try to increase stocks, but what restrictions of the local joint in relation to the frequency of deliveries per truck makes it difficult.
It expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and less promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to carry out Wednesday's promotion.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, said the stores replace the stock every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, leaves many empty spaces on shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion [of] that if there was an abundant amount on the shelves, if products like toilet paper and antiseptics could be [bought] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they would be out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain supply, according to News.com.au's report.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate vendors were offering free toilet paper to the first auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being held with buyers entering the long weekend off on Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of the NT News, a daily Darwin print, included an eight-page insert to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report from ABC Australia in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares a pandemic of COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only indicates the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO emphasized the need to push governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of spread and gravity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is a "unprecedented" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "outside influenza, no other respiratory viruses were monitored from the onset to continuous global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we had never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus".
And it continued "and we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time".
The new pandemic status follows the January WHO decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, stated that the outbreak, "in short, will worsen".
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 pandemic of coronavirus is a continuous pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronary virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, an international public health emergency of international concern was declared on 30 January 2020 and recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while overall it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptom onset is approximately five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping distance from people and monitoring and isolation of people with suspected infection.
Authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls, and closure of establishments.
The pandemic caused a severe global socioeconomic interruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by panic-induced purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the student population worldwide.
Disinformation about the virus spread online and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with descent and appearance from East and Southeast Asia and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus took place.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities of Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
In large part, the cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesaler market and, therefore, it is believed that the virus has zoonotic origin.
The virus causing the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and that has close connection with the coronaviruses of the bat, the pangolim and the SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms of which one is aware became ill on December 1, 2019 and did not have visible connections with the later group of the seafood market.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two thirds were related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case pointed to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei Province, who may have been the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new reported cases decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 years or less, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK’s leading scientific advisor, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive according to official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that, by January 23, China estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic number of reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, 14 days being the most common.
By April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, until February 5, approximately 80% of the deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official count of deaths by the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and who had a positive test for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without taking the test, for example, who died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the official number of deaths] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by episodic reports of underreporting in the US. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and by the characteristics of the population, such as age, gender and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) by April 10, 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms between January 1–10, 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die due to a disease, and the lethality rate of infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die due to the disease.
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific population of infection by solving the case.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the rate of lethality of the infection for the pandemic, in general, is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this interval is compatible with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the estimates of CFR.
The WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change according to the site.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University stated that, "without proper control, infectious epidemics usually reach their peak and then decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when this will occur."
Chinese senior medical advisor Zhong Nanshan argued that "it can end by June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, stated that SARS-CoV-2 "probably will continue in circulation for a year or two".
According to the study of Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated: "I find it unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it is highly transmissible" and "that it may become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of reappearance will depend on group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively nonspecific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretion (catarrhoea), loss of olfactory sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people becomes seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms are difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and blue-coloured face or lips. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease may cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with results from tests that confirm the infection, therefore, researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a person with confirmed infection are monitored and examined closely to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from some to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their olfactory sensation was initially 30% and later dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or talking, being the close contact considered from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing droplets can also be produced during expiration, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
Droplets can land on the mouths and noses of nearby people or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in air propagation.
Propagation can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their own eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the feces, it is believed that the risk of this is low.
The government of China denied the possibility of oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission was identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for a day on cardboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans. However, the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus resemble those of coronavirus related in their nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It's believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B).Two strains of this same strain are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity throughout the genome to other coronavirus samples from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of genome sequences between the pangolin virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the entire genome, so far, has found, at most, 92% of genetic material sharing between the pangolim coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms. Definitive confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or computed tomography (CT).
A study in Wuhan comparing RRT-PCR with CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although it is less specific, with many of its imaging characteristics coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CT be not used for screening or as a front-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
The WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase reaction and chain (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available from a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is performed in nasopharyngeal smearing, although throat smearing is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
By April 6, 2020, none of these had been sufficiently precise to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The particularities of radiographic images and computed tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an online international database of imaging results in confirmed cases.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with those of CRP and demonstrated that, although the image is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its consideration as an investigation tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed for the detection of imaging characteristics of the virus with X-rays and with CT.
Strategies to prevent disease transmission include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a tissue and placing this handkerchief directly in a waste container.
It is advised who has already been infected to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted or advised non-essential trips going to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some members of the community do not know where or how they have been infected. It is recommended that health professionals care for individuals who may be infected to use standard precautions, eye contact precautions and protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use by governments of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issuing a statement asking for limits to this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as, for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with collars, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working for the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty. You should also wash your hands before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol when there is no soap and water readily available.
WHO advises you to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (in up to one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a surface of stainless steel), including ethanol at 62–71%, isopropyl alcohol at 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5% and iodinepovidone at 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in case of suspicion or confirmation COVID-19 in a place such as an office or a day care center, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with a folded elbow or a tissue of paper when coughing or sneezing, as well as immediately discarding any handkerchief.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since wearing a mask can limit the volume and displacement distance of expiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "The use of masks can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene." Masks have also been recommended by caregivers of people who may have the disease.
The WHO recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people not to touch their own faces.
In several countries, the use of face masks by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the USA, the CDC recommends the use of a non-medical face mask made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming in close contact with someone else (get 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a surgical mask when using public transportation or when staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to leave in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when they left in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone entering supermarkets wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, demanded passengers on intermunicipal trains and buses to wear face masks from April 1st.
In Panama, it is mandatory to wear a face mask when going out on the street. At the same time, it is recommended to produce masks at home for those who cannot buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing disease transmission, by reducing close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centers.
Methods of social distancing can be applied by all when staying at home, limiting their journeys, avoiding crowded areas, using uncontacted greetings and keeping distance from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people assembled recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in one region) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face a higher risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify that the objective is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social connections, be it virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" led to the implications that social isolation was necessary completely instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone with whom you live, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspected they were infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have demanded or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive instructions for self-quarantine were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with wide-scale transmission have been advised to perform 14 days of autoquarantine since the last possible exposure.
The strategies for the control of an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
Containment is performed in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as to present other measures to control the infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer contained, efforts will be made to reduce: the measures taken now serve to reduce the speed of the spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time in combination.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic at a basic reproduction rate below 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic.
Thus, the risk of overload of health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not pharmaceutical in nature and that can administer the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks for the face and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distance, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of events that lead to agglomerations; community involvement, in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning of contact surfaces. More drastic actions, in order to contain the outbreak, were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became clear. Whole cities, for example, were quarantined and travel bans were imposed.
Other countries have taken various steps to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, presented mass screening and quarantines located. Moreover, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when performing the autoquarantine and, for those who did not do so, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of face masks and those who stored medical supplies were punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (the decrease in the rate of contagion, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (i.e., the reversal of the growth of the epidemic) present great challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce the peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, at the same time overloading health systems.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it must be maintained as long as there is circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is availability of a vaccine, if this occurs before. Otherwise, transmission occurs again as soon as the measures are relaxed.
A long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts to develop medicines, which include testing existing medicines.
The use of cold medicines that do not require medical prescription, drink enough liquid, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, it may be necessary to use oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid.
The use of steroids may worsen the condition.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "married and traditional" medicines can alleviate the symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
The WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to shift their resources to various levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for testing COVID-19, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures, and the separation and isolation of patients with positive tests for COVID-19, as well as the increase in intensive care capabilities through personnel training and the increase in the number of beds and ventilators available.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case in the new coronavirus dates from December 1, 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
Within one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus would come from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital. The next day, the doctor informed Wuhan Jianghan’s Center for Disease Prevention and Control.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a SARS-like coronary virus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, on December 31, made a statement to the population and informed the WHO.
Cases of pneumonia of sufficient unknown origin had already been reported to the Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread across other provinces of China, facilitated by Chinese New Year's migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transport center, as well as a major railway connection point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later official data show that 6,174 people had developed symptoms by January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy, with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Depending on the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
Country reactions included containment measures, such as quarantines (also known as home confinement orders, home containment orders or lockdown) and curfews. On April 2, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are confined in some way in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, around 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests a previous case, dated November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26. Her hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control on December 27.
Initial genetic tests, on December 27, 2019, in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a coronavirus of the SARS type.
A statement to the population was issued by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan's doctors were warned by the police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The China National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in the history of mankind", a health cordon was announced on January 23 to interrupt return or return trips to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities of Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year's celebrations on January 25 were cancelled in several locations.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to care for more patients.
Together with newly built hospitals, China converted 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention centers and stadiums. On January 26, the government launched further measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including issuing health declarations for travelers and expanding the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools throughout the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were made in Hubei and out of it.
Public transportation has been modified, and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
The control of the movement of the public was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) went through some kind of exit restriction. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict steps to prevent the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers arriving in the city. On March 23, mainland China had only one domestic transmission case in five days, in that case, by means of a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, the Chinese Prime Minister, Li Keqiang, reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China’s Foreign Minister announced, on March 26, 2020, that the entry of individuals with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, without specific details on when this policy will be terminated.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to companies. The Council of State declared a day of mourning, beginning with a three-minute moment of silence throughout the country, on April 4 at 10 a.m., coinciding with the Qingm Festival. The central government, however, asked the families to pay their tributes online, observing the physical distancing to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country's national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
It is suspected that Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
On February 22, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after testing to confirm that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline schedule was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world in terms of screening the population for the virus. The country also isolated infected people and tracked down and quarantined those who come into contact with them.
The screening methods included the mandatory individual report of symptoms for those arriving from international trips through a mobile application, drive-thru virus test, with results available the next day, in addition to the increase in testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
The South Korean program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it did not quarantine entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided as to the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions requesting Moon's impeachment under the allegation of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or extolling their response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in four weeks.
On 29 March it was announced that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad should be quarantined for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with virus testing from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included canceling concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, closing universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion Riais to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that he had no plans for quarantined areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities before the New Year Persian Nowruz continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
Amid allegations of cover-up of the spread of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their Iran-related cases on 28 February indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government until that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch strongly requested Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders arrested for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The agency stated that there is a greater risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions as detention centers, which also suffer from lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the largest since the outbreak began in the country.
At least 12 politicians or retired and government officials died as a result of the disease until March 17.
By March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to Coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five times as many cases in Iran as is being reported.
It is suggested that the US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has requested that economic sanctions be alleviated for the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The cases began to increase sharply, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with the cases of COVID-19 was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In areas of outbreak, people's entrances and exits are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On March 4, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities by the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including the A Series football matches, have to be held behind closed doors by April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations for medical ethics in relation to screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy passed China as the country with the most Coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 pandemic-related deaths.
On March 22, it was reported that Russia sent nine military planes with medical supplies to Italy.
As of April 5, it had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus so far may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK's response to the virus first emerged as one of the mildest countries affected, and by 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a consequence, the government received criticism for the recognized lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement in which he advised the interruption of all non-essential trips and social contact, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and academies, should be closed as soon as possible, and undertook to pay 80% of workers’ wages up to a limit of £2,500 a month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distance measures, preventing agglomerations with more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activities to the minimum necessary.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police by issuing fines and dispersing agglomerations.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with business exceptions considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and auto shop.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control — the leading public health institute of the United States government — announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite having done so, the United States had a slow start to the tests, which concealed the true extent of the outbreak at that time.
The testing was marked by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of approval by the federal government for test kits that were not government (of academies, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested by the beginning of March (a medical request was necessary subsequently).
By February 27, the Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been performed.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many people who had the symptoms and had a medical request had to wait hours or days to take a test."

Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne have also been reported as popular destinations for people who traveled from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least capable among the 20 most popular destinations in terms of preparation, while cities in Australia were considered the most capable. Australia authorized its Emergency Response Plan for the New Coronavirus (COVID-19) on February 7.
She stated that much was yet to be discovered about the COVID-19, and that Australia would emphasize border control and communication in its response to the pandemic.
On March 21, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.

Belgium collected 100,000 unusable masks, which were supposedly from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China’s aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the outbreak of SARS 2002-2004, where Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hindered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid panic near the lunar new year festivities".
On 23 January, in reaction to the decision of the main authorities to implement a ban on transportation in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that certainly was not a WHO recommendation" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated." On 30 January, after confirmation of transmission between humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak as the International Public Health Emergency (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that the PHEIC was invoked due to the "risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that interfere unnecessaryly in international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and travel."
On February 5, WHO called on the global community for a contribution of 675 million dollars to finance strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency of helping these countries that "do not have systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, and even if it arises".
Tedros made further statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community to "invest now or will have to pay later." On February 11, WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros declared that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres had agreed to provide the "power of the entire United Nations system as a response".
The United Nations Crisis Management Team has been activated as a result, allowing the coordination of the entire United Nations response, which the WHO declares will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies can enter their experience in the social, economic and development implications resulting from the outbreak".
On February 14, a WHO Joint Mission Team with China was empowered to provide international and WHO experts on land in China with assistance in domestic management and to assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through workshops and meetings with major national institutions and to carry out field visits to assess "the impact of response activities on provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural panoramas." On February 25, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible Coronavirus pandemic", stating that, although it was too early to declare a pandemic, countries should still set up "a preparation phase".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the global risk assessment of the Coronavirus threat would be high from "high" to "very high", is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," insisting that correct response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also stated that current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director General said that the WHO was "deeply concerned with the alarming levels of spread and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction." The WHO faced many criticisms for what was seen as an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a petition to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom to present his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right to interventions to save their lives and that the government is responsible.
The group emphasized that the lack of resources or health insurance should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts pointed out that each individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, people with mental problems, homeless people, those living in extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups who need government help.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital center includes a Country Policy Tracker, which helps countries learn from each other and facilitates a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the United Kingdom Minister of the Office, Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro for the management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Province administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed because of their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political establishment to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public anger in relation to the outbreak of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officers, ex. Zhao Lijian rejected early recognition of the outbreak of Coronavirus that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
Donald Trump's administration of the United States referred to Coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus" saying that China's censorship "overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and "a way of diverting the administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained from a U.S. government cable a detailed communication strategy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being cited as "This has everything to do with China.
It was advised that we should try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. "Channels such as Politics, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of propaganda for a global influence.
The European Union's head of foreign policies, Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a biased and 'politics of generosity' point of view.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to suspend its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, while allegedly sending aid to those same countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by United States sanctions on April 3.
The United States authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own country.
And he hears disputes related to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey confiscated hundreds of fans destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticised the European Union's lack of solidarity with those affected by Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
The spokesperson for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering help to fellow Americans, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good phase, they would also act reciprocally if necessary."
The planned NATO military exercise "Defend 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a reduced scale.
The General Secretary for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, this endangers the lives not only of the United States troops and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government was strongly affected by the virus, with about a dozen infected members of parliament, as well as fifteen active or ex-political political figures.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to a lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of public health funding.
Political analysts anticipated that this might negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at government designated locations.
South Korean society was initially polarized on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment in relation to what they called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising their response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could enable governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those considered to have spread false news about the virus and the government's management of the crisis.
The outbreak of Coronavirus has been blamed for several cases of supply shortages, resulting from increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The United States Food and Administration issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and supplier interruptions.
Several locations also experienced the panic - motivated shopping event which led to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including supply shortages.
The technology industry in particular has warned about delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has risen 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that this would endanger the health of workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers, daigou, to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of formulas for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and in the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared from acute food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products were successful, avoiding the acute food shortage that was predicted in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not seen a large reduction, but prices can increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released reserves of pork to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China was badly hit in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures taken to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As Continental China is a major economy and manufacturing center, the viral outbreak was seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarals of The Economist's intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges of possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could overcome the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate from an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated an impact of $300 billion on the world supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) allegedly "confused" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to a low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside Continental China.
On February 27, due to the growing concerns about the Coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock exchange indices including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the average Dow Jones industry have shown their most expressive falls since 2008, with Dow falling at 1,191 points, the largest fall in a day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three other indexes ended the week with a decrease of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH stated China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again based on concerns with the coronavirus, the largest fall on March 16.
Many consider a likely economic downturn.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of central states and banks.
The central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including sights, and the recommendation of governments against any trip around the world.
As a consequence, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry was of a level never seen.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major travel station associated with Chinese New Year's holiday.
Several events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has increased its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in store schedules or temporary closures.
Visits to dealers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Resellers from North America and the Middle East observed a fall of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a fall of 33-43% in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
Shopping Center operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as greater cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Commission on Economics for Latin America, it is estimated that the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak peak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers were abandoned at home in inland provinces or imprisoned in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
The Coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily pay) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have gone through some kind of unemployment. Almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted confinement in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit program. Almost half a million companies in Germany put their workers under low-time work programmes subsidized by the government known as Kurzabeit.
The work remuneration programme with reduced German hours was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations, as well as the people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
Art and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the security of their employees and the public and help artists when possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have taken place to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and high-acceleration repercussion of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of Holy Week in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the period of Christian Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended elderly Christians to stay home rather than attend Masses on Sundays; some churches have provided church services via radio, live streaming online or on television while others offer drive-in style services.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese closing its churches and chapels and the empty St.Peter square without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and Gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as their residents in sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant interruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled to a date after 2020, but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world were closed and poker tournaments in person were also postponed or cancelled.
This led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their registration fees. The entertainment industry was also affected, with several music groups suspending or canceling their tours.
Many great theaters like Broadway have also canceled all shows.
Some artists have explored ways of continuing to produce and share their work on the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming shows or creating online "festivals" for artists to perform, share and disseminate their work.
Online, several memes on the internet about coronavirus are propagated, since many seek humor and entertainment amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people from areas of focus in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, distrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Results of February (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people to deserve the virus or to receive a just punishment for what they provoked.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed to those in the areas affected by the virus.
Following the outbreak in new countries, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions by pressing the ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan hashtag went to Twitter Trending Topics.
The Chinese people, like other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term regarded by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and evacuated foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeast India bordering China, and students in large cities of India reportedly suffered persecution related to the outbreak of coronavirus.
The president of the unit in the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, stated that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that is the reason why God turned against them".
Comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, who called it "mistaken." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign waste" and targets of "discard".
Many newspapers with paid access removed them from some or all coverages on the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have made available scientific articles related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their conclusions as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS - CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and developed only to detect RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (sorology) can be used for population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who became asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity of the herd in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests performed in the countries.
This variability probably still substantially affects the mortality rates of registered cases, which can be appreciably overestimated in some countries.
Using polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal smear or saliva sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours or 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharyngeal smear is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, the material from the samples can be removed from the bottom of the airways by suction catheter or material expelled by expectoration (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive emergency approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel for Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) of RT-PCR in real time to public health laboratories by the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of test kits generated inconclusive tests due to faulty reagents, and an obstacle to the CDC testing in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only from then on the local and state laboratories were allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency permit. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for the RT-PCR-based COVID-19.
Quest Diagnostics also made the tests for COVID-19 nationally available as of March 9, 2020.
No quantity restriction was announced; sample collection and processing should be performed according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received a FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) for Abbott laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorisation for the Holocaust, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a FDA US test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
As it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and binds it in a particular way to the nucleocapsid protein (protein N) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results within 15 to 20 minutes as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that " chest X-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, may be present even before the onset of symptoms".
Typical CT features include bilateral ground-glass multilobar opacities with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing CRP to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than CRP, although less specific, with many of its imaging aspects coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDC has recommended PCR for initial verification.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days ago or shortly after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to monitor the population. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by means of remote laboratory tests (PoCT).
Automated high productivity systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection stage is not necessary before the test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and from now on are able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies for the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional PCR viral RNA tests.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the acquired antibody testing kits were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will provide a sampling tube for the patient," they must spit saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result shortly after. The British NHS has announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of one patient infecting others if they go to the hospital or need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used. In the drive-thru tests for the COVID-19 in suspicious cases, a health professional collects samples taking the appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea carry out some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Doctors stated on March 2 that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, 10,700 of which had been tested the previous week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to Robert Koch Institute president, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, gathering samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, a 2000 m2 improvised laboratory for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: ., or "Fire Eye" in English) was opened on February 5, 2020 by the BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled if this testing capability did not have an online access.
The Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai in a total of 12 cities across China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily yield was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed models released by Origami Assays were launched as capable of testing up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19, using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without the need for robotic handlers for liquids.
In March, the shortage or insufficient amounts of reagent became an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the USA.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols involving the warming of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for additional testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates are now conducting more per capita tests in their population for Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on the way to increase testing level and reach most of the population.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capacity, and acquisition of a mass-scale population processing laboratory of Group 42 and BGI (inspired by its emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world on this scale to function outside China.
Different testing methods for different components of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany's method of manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Center for Disease Control was not available until January 28, there was a delay in tests made available to the U.S. and China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of test kits right at the start of the outbreak, in addition, these countries with Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing made by health professionals.
On the other hand, experts say that South Korea’s wide availability for testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, largely in the private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the government of South Korea.
On March 16, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs as the best way to delay the advancement of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private US laboratories, and the supply of swabs and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems accurately in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a failure to collect samples or incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish minister stated that he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China generated wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million China test kits considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded on the Danube. Until Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that Turkey’s test kits purchased from China had a “high error rate” and that it would not “use them”. The United Kingdom acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not useful.
The testing, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom the positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, performed two stages of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases discovered were quarantined.
With the movement to the restricted commune, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 in Singapore has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to strongly advise the inhabitants to stay home on March 28, but the schools reopened as planned after the holidays on March 23.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that the countries that performed the most tests, in relation to the number of deaths, had more lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with no or little symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive in % of tests" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only people hospitalized in hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they present symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand washing, is the act of washing hands for the purpose of removing dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
The washing of hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap are important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's butt or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling raw meat, frank or fish.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand hygiene:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, feed or animal waste.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main objective of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals that may cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and decreasing the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for hand washing can cause small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by the simple introduction of behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to needy areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes may be associated with washing hands with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (IRA), such as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main AKI, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the lives of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom in an ingrained habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths by diarrhea almost by half and deaths of acute respiratory infections in a room.
Handwashing is usually associated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Handwashing also protects against impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to skin drying.
A Danish study of 2012 found that excessive hand washing can cause a condition of peeling and irritation in the skin known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Frequent hand washing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (miction, defecation), after cleaning a child's butt (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other situations where the correct hand washing technique should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include the before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or blowing the nose; after touching animal waste or dealing with animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of washing hands with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families had the habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97 percent; the United States was close to the average with 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate with 23 percent. Several methods for behavior change currently exist to increase acceptance of the habit of washing hands with soap in critical periods. Collective hand washing for children in schools at certain times of the day is an alternative in developing countries to instill hand washing in children's habits.
The "Essential Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
Deparasitization twice a year, complemented by washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, are at the center of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is reinforced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, organic dirt components, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
The bar soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain the accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated bar soap concluded that transmission is unlikely since bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic dosing controls is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely released to the conscious public in terms of health.
To date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants may lead to the selection of organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even though antibiotic resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are reported.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, vegetable extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from hands as antibacterial soaps aimed at the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that's comfortable for hand washing isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 oC).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove natural oiliness that retains dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective to reduce the microbial burden on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand sanitizing agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-aqueous hand sanitizing agents based on alcohol (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizing product, antiseptic hand sanitizing product, or hand sanitizer) are gaining popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickener agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a moisturizer, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate the use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based hygienizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygienizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 logarithms reduction, similar to 35 decibels reduction) of bacteria in the hands, 30 seconds after their application and 99.999% (4 to 5 logarithm reduction) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after their application. Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost totally ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Alcohol-based hand antiseptics or hygienizers can be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands between the fingers and their ends are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed, being rubbed with both palms. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizers, especially when the hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid exterminator action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers may cause skin drying unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The dryness effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based hand sanitizers rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause irritative contact dermatitis has become an attraction when compared to hand washing with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aqueous base agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, they only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens still remain in the hands.
The efficacy of hand sanitizers without alcohol is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and historically it has fallen far short of alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have shown continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which has shown its efficacy reduced after recurrent use, probably due to the increasing adverse reactions on the skin.
Many people in low - income communities cannot afford a soap and instead use ash or land.
Ash or earth may be more effective than pure water, but they may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the earth or ash is contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, gray is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends gray and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Center for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands with cold or hot running water.
It is recommended running water since fixed sinks may be contaminated, while water temperature does not seem to be relevant.
Rub your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when soap is used instead of pure water.
Rub it for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rub for a longer time removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
The washing in a sink can recontaminate the hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let it dry outdoors.
Wet or damp hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, areas between fingers and under nails.
Artificial nails and chipped enamels can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep your hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate the washing of hands where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or cuia with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "improved turns" and other low-cost options.
An improvised tap is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a lever driven by the feet to pour a small amount of water into the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way to dry in public bathrooms.
A growing volume of research suggests that towel papers are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by paper towel, heated hand dryers and the most modern hand dryers with airjet.
After washing and drying the hands with a heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area next to the fingers and 254% in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air-jet dryers caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, 42% in the palm area close to the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying the hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area close to the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. The researchers also performed tests to define whether there was potential for cross-contamination among other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air-jet dryer, which projects air out of the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hands and the unit potentially contaminating other bathroom users and the environment within 2 meters away.
The use of a hand dryer with hot air spreads microorganisms to up to 0.25 meters of the dryer.
The towel papers did not present a significant dissemination of microorganisms.In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for drying the hands were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and the hand dryers have been compared with drying with paper towel.
Hand washing with wet hand wipes is an alternative to lack of soap and water during trips.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical handwashing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind the hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
A study found that infection rates decreased with its use.
Clinical hand washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to soap and scrub all parts of the hands.
The hands shall be rubbed simultaneously with the interlacing of the fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can remain in the water in your hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the tap (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents the recontamination of the hands through these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
A study revealed that adequate hand washing and other simple procedures may decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a report demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and friction in the health system sectors.
The organization's hand hygiene orientation project can also be found on this site for comments.
A review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate hand hygiene if the demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body fluids/sanguines
before an ascetic task, and
after patient care, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (medicinal soaps or "antimicrobials") confers an exterminator action on a handwashing agent.
Such exterminator action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, some antiseptics of chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, and a sterile brush for cleaning and other sterilized tools for cleaning under your nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of the hands and forearms up to the elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms should not flow to the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands are wiped with a sterile towel and the surgical gown is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after attending a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of cleaning the hands in the first 20% of washing, and an additional little significant benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds for each revealed that the alcohol-based hand sanitizer reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium difficile spurs in the hands. Interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital environments may involve the team's awareness of hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and verbal and written warnings to the team.
More research is needed on which interventions are more efficient in different health facilities.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable water sources, soap or hand washing resources in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the achievement of universal hand washing practice.
For example, in most rural Africa the handwashing taps near any public or private bathrooms are rare, although there are cheap options for the construction of handwashing stations.
However, low rates of hand washing may instead be the result of rooted habits rather than the absence of soap and water.
The incentive and defense of hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of hand washing and cause a long-term change in behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand washing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's "three-star approach" that encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the top three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be a part of the promotional campaigns for hand washing carried out in order to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The world day for hand washing is another example of awareness campaign that tries to achieve a change of habit. As a result of the 2018-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF released the adoption of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the DALY classification.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food origin and infections associated with health care led the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "techniques for proper hand washing" were hung next to sinks for hand washing in public bathrooms and in bathrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands" means declaring reluctance to take responsibility or be conniving with something.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a phrase of more general use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to cleanse an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more frequently than others, and usually give more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of "cleaning", such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of characteristic hands in many religions, including Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, Tevilah and nethylat yadayim in Judaism, the lavatory in Christianity, and ablution in Islam. Religions also indicate hygienic hand washing, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam authorize the washing of hands after the use of the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam authorize the washing of hands before and after meals.
Hazard controls at the workplace for COVID-19
Hazard controls at work for COVID-19 are the application of occupational health and safety methodologies for danger controls for the prevention of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace hazard controls depend on the workplace and on the work itself, based on the risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, who may be vulnerable to contraction of COVID-19.
According to the Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), the functions with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including washing of hands, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory label and a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Functions with an average risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or direct contact with people about whom it is not known whether they are contaminated or suspected of being contaminated by COVID-19, but may be infected due to current community transmission or because they have traveled abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public as in schools, high population density work environments, and in the large-volume retail market.
The danger controls for this group, in addition to the basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with use of high-efficiency air filters, protective coverage and the availability of personal protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that workers in the health system and morgues who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures in people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 aerosol generation and collect or handle specimens of these people.
Proper hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they become sick, because they have to take care of other people or because they fear possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of what products are in demand and the means of acquiring these products (such as shopping outside peak hours or by delivery services or drive-thru.
Finally, the sending of items from areas seriously affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protection actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors of individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls needed to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action plans and preparation for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people who are at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hazard control hierarchy is a structure widely used in health and safety at work to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protective equipment.
The engineering controls involve the isolation of workers from work-related hazards without counting on the worker's behavior, and may be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the policy or work procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of the danger to the worker, adjusted appropriately as necessary (breathers, for example), used appropriately and continuously, inspected regularly, stored and replaced as needed, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of appropriately to avoid contamination.
According to the United States Department of Health and Labor Safety (OSHA), jobs with low risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic measures to prevent infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick and using the respiratory label, including covering sneezing and coughing, preparing containers for handkerchiefs and ordinary garbage, preparing for telework or staggered shifts, if necessary, discouraging the use of other workers' tools and equipment, and maintaining a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and other people in the workplace.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay home until they have no more fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or relieve other symptoms, and also recommends that sick leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick member of the family, and that they are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, studies with average risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people about whom it is not known whether they are confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to the current community transmission in the locality of the company, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad, in a country with high transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who have contact with the general public as in schools, high population density work environments, and some retail stores with high sales volume. Engineering controls for this group and for higher risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic hygienic bulkheads, installation of a drive-thru window for customer care. Administrative controls for this group and higher risk groups include encouraging workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, establishing staggered shifts, cancelling non-essential trips to sites with a current COVID-19 epidemic, developing communication plans, including a forum to answer workers' doubts, providing training and updated instruction on risk factors and protection practices against COVID-19, training of workers who need to wear clothing and equipment for use, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, requirement of constant cleaning of the hands, and personal protection of the workplace, including the use of the personal protection of the personal hands, and protective of the personal protection of the workers.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes sick on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the isolation of the sick person from the other persons for a distance of 6 feet, with the designation of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer him a face mask, or ask the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a biologically hazardous waste bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected next. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, danger controls include postponement of the journey by the patient passenger, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical center on board if someone has fever or other symptoms while travelling.
Ideally, medical follow-up occurs in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and childcare centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is a minimum to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large groups such as physical or coral education classes, or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between the tables, more rigid arrival and departure times, limitation of non-essential visitors and use of a separate place of health care for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to strategies of social distancing, prolonged school dispensations can be considered. For law enforcement authorities performing daily activities, immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who come into contact with individuals with suspected COVID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medicine technicians, including the use of adequate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers must clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a spray or common cloth of domestic cleaning and follow standard operating procedures for containment and disposal of PPE used and for the containment and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers certain health workers and morgues as being in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
Functions with high risk of exposure include workers delivering medicines, medical care, laboratories and medical transport, who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive collection of specimens.
Works in high-exposure morgues include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at the time of death; the risk of exposure makes it very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 disease, including when aerosol generating procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure may be adequate in some mortuary scenarios and in the health area.
Specimens should be handled with caution at level 3 biosecurity.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter the hospital be separated into two distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspicious case for COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends breathers for professionals who work at a distance of 6 feet from patients with confirmation or suspicion of SARS-COV-2 infection, and for professionals who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 particulate filtered facial breathers approved by NIOSH or high-quality breathers should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of breathers can provide protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of overalls, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory bodily fluids.
The WHO recommends only one surgical mask for the triage staff at the point of entry.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, eyeglasses or facial protection, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct patient care to enter a room with a patient with COVID-19, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuous use of the same breather without removing it while treating several patients with the same diagnosis, monitor and coordinate the chain of PPE supplies and discourage the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Attenuation of problems and preparation for the future
DATE/SENDING HOUR: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No right reserved
We're in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and our responsibilities towards the other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and community creation, which are the foundations of this organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, phone calls and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have all of you as co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me your recognition for our work.
This person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol is that this essential feature remains online and available to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, because you keep your workplaces active, pay our coworkers, and keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but the way we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its function in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the coming days and months.
In this meeting, we consider what we think is an appropriate action to what we are experiencing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable in this period.
We want to end the stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to go away for a while, it's okay.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily work expectation will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until it is arranged otherwise.
We're not declaring a holiday, so if you can work on your regular schedule, it might be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy supplies or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedule.
If you're sick, don't work.
That rule wouldn't even need to be expressed, but we've decided to declare it.
There is no need for a certificate or paid leave. Just inform your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that the key areas of the work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification sector so that his sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention).
The staff who work per hour will receive full payment.
We've said this before, and we're committing ourselves to honoring our commitment to our contractors and employees who work by the hour.
Everyone will receive their wages on the basis of their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
Wages depend on whether you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll give you full support.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We only ask you to communicate with your manager, so that we know what to expect and we can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities we should continue to perform.
Site Reliability Engineering, HR, Reliability and Security and Fund Building (among others) teams carry out essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate the current goals and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us in the future.
We have no intention of "working double to make up for lost time" after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new targets and deadlines as appropriate.
What will happen to annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide longer budget time, and that employees prioritize the essential work, personal care and care of loved ones, while accommodating those who need or want to work on a reduced journey in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual Planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, as a precaution, we employed an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and all the elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is employing its own protocol of care duties using products that are safe for its frequenters.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our office in Washington is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol to the COVID-19 with us and with all Washington employees.
Last week, our office in Washington switched to a totally remote configuration, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we're also discussing the location of an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
Limit the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider dividing them in several days.
Set the meeting, have a schedule, and send materials for reading in advance.
Use the videos as default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate real-time collaboration and connection.
Have a leader to facilitate the meetings, someone who monitors the questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to assist in increasing remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editing marathons, until WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We warned them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their agreed grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying their goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be of sadness with the paralysis, but also of relief with the clarity and ability to keep the focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and other situations.
The communication resources team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Keeping up-to-date on COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with the staff.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with whatever it takes.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information from this email and all other information related to COVID-19 in the company's wiki.
The communication resources team will update these pages and all information in a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, be sure to notify it and work with the communication resources team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of HR Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, an acknowledgement that, at the moment, our work and obligations will probably need to adapt in a way that we have not adapted in the past.
These are the steps we believe are needed as support at this time, so that we can continue working, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months after.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need everyone to take care of you and your family so that you're in your best condition when you need to be.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communication resources team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme coupled to the external surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising medicine directed to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as an entry point in the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 is a metalloenzyme that contains zinc located on the endothelial surface and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a peptide M2 N-terminal domain and a C-terminal amino acid transporter domain and colectrin in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-pass membrane type 1 protein with its enzyme-active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the domain of transmembrane by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in many organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of the main pulmonary alveolar cells type II, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight to ECA.
ACE cleaves type I angiotensin hormone into type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ACE2 in turn cleaves carboxyterminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Ph) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also cleaves several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates transport through the membrane of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and was implicated in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 acts as the main point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 protein to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by host serine-protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help in the fight against infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing with the ACE inhibitor pattern and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analyses published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who presented a high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia".
It is believed that recombinant human ECA2 (rhACE2) is a new therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with an acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of the effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which angiotensin II is in circulation. Infused rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Applications on COVID-19 are mobile software applications to help monitoring in response to the coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures to create contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially about systems based on tracking the geographic location of the application users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, implemented an application that allows citizens to check if they were in contact with a person carrying COVID-19.
It is in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app has been awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government declared that the contact tracking app was in advanced development stage, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is scheduled for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand predict applications based on the TraceTogether application from Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave the house.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if the acceptance of the application is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits for the types of organizations that can add applications related to coronavirus to your App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits for this type of surveillance.
Organizations have declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extension of monitoring and surveillance would have to have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for the purposes of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid further discrimination and marginalisation;
any data sharing with third parties should be provided for in law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from your device operating systems when it is no longer required.
Some countries have used a network-based location tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system gathered tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate warnings via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government also made location information publicly available, which is allowed due to comprehensive changes to the confidentiality laws of information after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralized one.
By April 6, 2020 the details had not yet been released.
Contact tracking preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography dating back to at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on solutions that respect privacy, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the proximity of a user to other mobile devices.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that covers centralized and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include the Decentralized privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leave the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during collection and use of location data or crossing paths to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication "Apps Play Dirty: Keeping Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a burden that develops privacy technologies and originally founded on the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and guardians without compromising the privacy of such data.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that united around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the achievement of widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government app, became open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed that they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system provides for three-stage implementation:
development of tools to allow the government to create official applications of coronavirus tracking preserving privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to tackle persistent and assumed surveillance issues by first distributing the system for system updates in operation, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug reproposal, reperfilation, reassignment or therapeutic replacement) is the reproposal of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than the one for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drogable proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these binding points provides the reasonable design of effective antiviral drug development against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are protease similar to papain, RNA polymerase dependent RNA, helicase, S protein and ADP ribofosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that then improved and analyzed for their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a drug against malaria that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Clinical Study Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
Treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised by the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors say they're using the drug when "there's no other option."
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU School of Medicine Langone is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen stated that Favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence to support the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan to store it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for the Trump administration on the purchase of the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit has been observed".
Drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to repropose drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences discovered after remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against phylum, pneumo, paramix and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the resistance developed by mutations, which can cause more serious transmissions or diseases.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for hospitalized and severely ill people with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (in China and Canada), while the other has no control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans a clinical trial of Alvesco (ciclesonide), Teijin company, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The aim is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with an angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 is ongoing with 200 patients, to be recruited from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the efficacy of treatment.
Currently, researchers from the Heart Institute in Canada are investigating the function of colchicine in reducing pulmonary complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women were not included in the tests, who are breast-feeding or who do not use effective contraceptive methods.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study with 300 patients is analyzing the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages.The study was announced on April 14, Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable to give new purpose to approved and developed antiviral drugs for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS and the Western Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines.
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as capable of receiving a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against Coronavirus disease from 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the clinical trials completed, there are several ongoing attempts to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated not to expect a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, a virus that causes the disease, available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a large spread of the outbreak in 2020, which led to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Epidemic Preparation Innovation Coalition, CEPI, declared in April that the needs for the development of the vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 platforms of diverse technologies being researched and under development during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The targets of the largest platforms that have advanced to phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and candidate for vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to Milken Institute). Another 37 were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being designed).
A phase I-II test performs safety testing and preliminary immunogenicity. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in avoiding the disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccine (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (followed by preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular staple, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, Canada, the International Vaccines Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, announced the beginning of work on a vaccine, with the aim of testing humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Center for Disease Prevention and Control in China on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the beginning of their work for the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developed an oral vaccine with her biotech partner Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the preparation of a vaccine with technology similar to that used for neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary company of Generex, NuGenerex Immnuno-Oncology, announced that they were starting a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested on humans "in the next 90 days".

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced preclinical testing plans and Phase I clinical studies in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated pace, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in research in the laboratory, with the human tests planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian declared that the President of the United States, Donald Trump offered CureVac "great sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, a mRNA-based candidate vaccine, currently in preclinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have preclinical testing results in April 2020 and its candidate for the final vaccine could leave for human testing in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Epidemic Preparation Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research consortium for the vaccine for the COVID-19 involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, leading the total investment of CEPI in the development of the vaccine for the COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other investment partners of CEPI for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing animals for six different vaccine candidates.
The researchers at Imperial College in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for the COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequencing from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the initiatives of the University of Saskatchewan.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other Coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that "MNA delivered vaccines from SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 that raised potent antibody responses specific to antigens [in rat] that were evident to have started two weeks after immunization."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacterium to produce virus-like harmless particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers in combination with cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease she prevents.
A later randomized test in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 health workers.
It is possible that developing vaccines are not safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specimens of animals specific to the COVID-19, such as the ACE2-transgenic rat, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates a need for containment measures for level 3 biosecurity to manipulate live viruses, and an international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in specimens of non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARS that has proved safe and effective in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. Nor is there a proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that the existing research of SARS could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against infection of MERS-CoV.
From March 2020, there was one vaccine against MERS (based on DNA) that completed phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are virus vectorized vaccines, two with adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various publications in social media indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other Coronavirus strains such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute Coronavirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The exposure time to onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153 thousand deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have healed. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced when they expire, they usually fall to the ground or stay on surfaces rather than remain infectious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although dissemination may be possible before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for those responsible for their care.
Recommendations for mask use by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others require use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local disease transmission was recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop symptoms similar to flu, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty keeping awake, face or blue lips.
Less common, upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sneezing, running nose or sore throat can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop the symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of the infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The function that these asymptomatics perform in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not present symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The China National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1st; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Loudly releases more droplets than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Science suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside people's rooms contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted by air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through stools, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although transmission is possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease is disseminated, usually one or two people infect one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for a day on cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Soap products degrade the lipid protective envelope of the virus, deactivating it, and eliminating it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample presented the highest viral load, while the sixth patient presented the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronary virus of acute respiratory syndrome that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells by means of the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), which is more abundant in alveolar cells type II of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicle" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of the infected people who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the evolution of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for respiratory tract epithelial cells expressing ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 present symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it has been demonstrated that pathogenic T cells that secrete GM-CSF are correlated with the recruitment of secretive inflammatory monocytes of IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in necropsy.
The WHO published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard testing method is the polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or phlegm sample can be used.
Results are usually available in a few hours up to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected in the past) was developing, but has not yet been widely used.
The Chinese's experience with testing has shown that its accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The FDA of the United States approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by the University of Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (thickened lobular septums with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available regarding microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, atypical large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cells formation
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
pneumonia treated: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (ICD); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, often washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands without washing.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, as well as covering the mouth with the inner side of the elbow if the handkerchief is not available.
Adequate hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit the transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancel large public meetings.
Distancing guidelines also include that people are at least 1.8 metres (6 feet) away from each other.
There is no known effective drug for the prevention of COVID-19. Since the vaccine should not be released before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, also known as "falling the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing their noses, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using alcohol-based hand-based antiseptics with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where commercial hand-held antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity occurs through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepsis".
Glycerol is added as humidifying.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under analysis.
Healthy personal hygiene and lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. WHO and the China National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
U.S. intensivists and pulmonologists have gathered recommendations for the treatment of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Care must be taken to minimize the risks of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with isolation of airborne infections (SIIA) and taking standard precautions, contact precautions and aerial precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blanket, breather or face mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use breathers instead of face masks.
N95 breathers are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
They were designed to protect against air particles as dust, but their efficacy against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undescribed uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure at two levels.
If either of these two leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to have invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits aerosol particles to spread, compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in the elderly (those over 60 years and especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to cope with the sudden escalation in the number of cases of COVID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China observed that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control mode and high PEEP level are needed to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung and pneumothorax injuries associated with ventilation.
High level of PEEP may not be available on older fans.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials are being conducted with various antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take up to 2021 to be developed, several of the tested drugs have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing phase.
Antiviral medicinal product can be tested in people with various diseases.
The WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the tests of effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA gave temporary authorization for the use of plasma of convalescent people as treatment in cases where the life of the person is serious and immediately threatened.
The necessary clinical studies have not yet been performed to show their safety and effectiveness against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The application can detect the "near contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities. Cellular big data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are being used to track down infected people and the people they have had contact with in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data from people supposedly with coronaviruses.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect people who can contact infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to research and prevent virus transmission.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect whoever breaks quarantine.
The Italian regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was informed by mobile operators that "40% of people continue to circulate anyway".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackaton on the weekend with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience quarantine difficulties, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said, "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may develop mildly, with few or no symptoms, appearing to be other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the cold.
Light cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe infection of COVID-19, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but missing data from COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of those hospitalized in hospitals with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median onset of symptoms until death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by the China National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The imaging of the lung looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the China National Health Commission, heart damage was detected due to elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing comorbidities, and the availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality due to comorbidity vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Underreporting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die, compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authority found a decrease of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage to the organ.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
By March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who have recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as probable, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported in which the recovery of COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
It is believed that these cases are the worsening of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin, through infection by overflowing.
The real origin is unknown, but from December 2019, the spread of the infection became almost entirely driven by human to human transmission.
A study of the 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the oldest date of the onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the oldest date of symptoms such as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time elapsed since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and health in general.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the disease codes emergency ICD-10 U07.1 for deaths resulting from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the laboratory and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the laboratory.The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall mortality rate was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) on April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the mortality rate per case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die of a disease, and the rate of lethality by infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die of a disease.
These statistics are not limited to time and accompany a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information on how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease was propagated by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 must have been formally recorded as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been burdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as seen in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had confirmed death by COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the age of 50, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunologic differences due to gender, lower prevalence of smoking women and the development by men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data from sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
The head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, explained that "CO" is for "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", disease and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan's coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV" as interim names for the virus and the disease, according to the 2015 orientation against the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material such as nasopharyngeal zaragotes and respirators parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on the necessary schedule, a local startup did reverse engineering and printed the 100 needed valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19, conspiracy theories, wrong information and misinformation about the origin, dimension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is underway in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more probable efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous works on SARS-CoV are being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the whole virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection of COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spic protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There have been over 300 clinical trials underway since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs makes up most of Chinese research, with nine clinical trials in phase III of remdesivir in several countries due to a late April report.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicines are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the USA, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for a joint review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be further studied in vivo after demonstrating low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicle protein in preparation by serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-storm properties of cytokines. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the China National Health Commission after the conclusion of a small study.
A non-randomized test is underway in phase 2 of the national level in Italy, after having shown positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of cytokine release syndrome refractory to steroids induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccination passive immunization method.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the mechanism of action expected by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of patients recovered and contains antibodies specific to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of strongly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after he became aware of the spread of the virus.
