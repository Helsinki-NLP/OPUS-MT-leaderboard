Members of the Assembly of Wales fear "passing Muppets"
There is a dismay on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Deputy Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Gallery Parliament".
Some Members of this House, from all political colours, fear that this will make them ridiculous.
A Labour AM stated that the group is concerned that "the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Galesian readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrements".
A Plaid AM stated that the group as a whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP stated that the group was "open-minded" in relation to the name change, but said that the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a pronunciation similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will of course be taken by themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales 2017 gave its assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received widespread support for the proposal to designate the assembly as "Gals Parliament".
On the question of the title of the AMs, the Commission favoured "Deputies of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring consensus together may be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft legislation on the amendments in a few weeks' time.
Reform legislation will include other changes to how the assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the commission system.
When they debate the legislation, AMs will have the final say on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will refer to changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which is part of a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that its neighbour's name to the north is a complaint about its territory and has repeatedly objected to its applications for EU membership and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, stated that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zaev, argue that changing the name is nothing more than the price to be paid for EU membership and NATO.
Bells of St. Martin shut up at a time when the churches of Harlem fight for survival
"In a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, understood.
"People socialize differently," he said today.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned about the possibility that the money earned by the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect" and that, sooner or later, everything will return exactly to its starting point".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the shrines of the neighborhood that remain.
"The overwhelming majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so this will speed up the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, for it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was then installed by a black congregation that performed its worships in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street shopkeepers, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson’s parishioners commissioned the reel.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the chime "the bells of the poor".
The specialist who touched the carrillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and an "unreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also mentioned that he was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the biggest carillon in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather claimed that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the parish governing body composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "would seek to pass on the costs", despite the fact that it was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark causes injuries to 13-year-old teenagers in a California lobster hunt dive
A shark attacked and injured a 13 - year - old on Saturday during a lobster hunt in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place shortly after 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help, and then rowed towards him with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming "I got bit!"
I've been bitten!
The entire clavicle area was torn apart, described Hammel as what he observed when he reached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
The lifeguard Captain Larry Giles stated in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access from Point Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for research purposes and for security reasons.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetics sections in the style of the big warehouses, supported by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain a share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at GBP 2.8 billion, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion clothing and household items retreat, these largest cosmetic sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be implemented in more stores next year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand by supermarkets for ways to use once-used exhibition space for TVs, microwaves and home articles.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would double its catalogue of beauty products with the offer of up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also obtain more space with branded areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its range of Boutique makeup so that most products obey vegan precepts, something increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London last week. It is expected that the second, in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, will open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing eating habits to small amounts of daily shopping in nearby shops have now led supermarkets to have to work harder to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses, at a time when the supermarket chain tries to fight off Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos points of sale in hundreds of shops, and has also installed a number of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this has strengthened sales of grocery products and made purchases more profitable.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetic and pharmacy departments ended up in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from health products stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago for £125 million.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four shops a wide range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more enjoyable environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the customer.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that break with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby had abandoned business of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, became "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby abandoned a £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of articles for the home and truly accessories.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old host announced on Instagram that she would abandon the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones livid by abandoning the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her highly profitable new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furious" when the golden girl on TV admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her corporate empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses (whose value can amount to £1.5 million), implied that she would no longer have time to dedicate herself to her brand of home items and accessories Truly.
The deal was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was on a plane to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source stated: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It would mean the resolution of its future in the long run and would be a financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave left everyone absolutely amazed.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday was this close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that leaving the presenter of This Morning, who is among Britain's most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions, given the large investment in products, ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and articles for the home, and the potential for additional delays in launching.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, at the age of 52, joined the project as president in March.
Couples take vacations together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become brand ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity from ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that "We don't intend to comment on his business."
Tough talk "and then we fell in love"
The U.S. President jokingly mentioned the criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump stated, in his fake voice of "TV news pivot".
"I didn't give in to anything."
She mentioned that Kim is interested in a second meeting after her initial meeting in Singapore in June, and stressed that it would be a major step in the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for denuclearisation are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to the first steps towards disarmament in North Korea.
Instead, he said, the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
Trump stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results: the end of tests with rockets, support in the release of hostages and the return to the country of the remains of U.S. military.
Besides, he defended his unusual approach when he talked about relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly ahead of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had been displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for channelling international aid.
"Unfortunately, they were, in many cases, clear to declare that they are not asking for international help; so it becomes a bit difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organising a team that will head up Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Response Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for the wraths of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm mermaid in Palu, despite the existence of a warning, had contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favourable times, travelling among the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made improving decrepit infrastructure a central part of his election campaign, spent huge amounts on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has plagued Mr Joko's executive at a time when he faces his re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
Over 1000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes a long shot for the tie goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal at the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, with his team losing by 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before making a shot towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area by heading to the top right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to reach that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq advance as far as possible, so I was just earning as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched him, and I didn't think too much about it.
Chelsea won 1-0 at the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute by the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this move, the Blues advance gave a heel-back pass to Mateo Kovacic before unscheduling near the midfield and sprinting towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass at midfield.
Then he made a beautiful shot that crossed the counter defense, leading Hazard to the large area.
He overcame the defenses and made the goal against the net of the second beam with a left-foot shot that passed through Liverpool's Alisson Becker goalkeeper.
Liverpool faces Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at three o'clock Thursday afternoon in London.
Number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, declared early Sunday the country's disaster response agency.
There are reports that describe a large number of people trapped in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old male on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged the population of the area to witness something giving information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I'd like to appeal to everyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious that would contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images from dashboard cameras, particularly taxi drivers, who will contact us because they may have information crucial to the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they knew the victim went to the scene to inquire about where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, with police reporting to the victim's close relatives at the moment.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to access his apartment, but was informed by the police that entrances or exits from the building are prohibited.
When he was informed of what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being informed that they won't be able to return to their homes for hours.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
You repeatedly claim that "it's so horrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the immediate outer area.
A number of police officers inside the cordon were deployed to guard the apartment building.
We ask anyone who has information to contact by DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament became the most recent monument swallowed up by the contention of "historical revisionism"
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, which reminds the Taliban of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable that, in the current debate on the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell next to Westminster Palace would become a target to be shot down.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent representation, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony of the 19th-century opinion and part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe is worthy of homage.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes an entirely precise description is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents a side of that division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of homage and celebration".
Killer pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a Southwest China market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with an artery cut and covered in blood, near a dump in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reads in the South China Morning Post Sunday.
The pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighboring dump.
In this dump, I said, there was a big male pig with blood on his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 - pound pig had attacked the pig grower to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed, said the cousin, referred to by his nickname "Wu", according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent it from attacking other people while police were gathering evidence at the scene of the incident.
Reports state that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - kilo - pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife managed to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as "stimulus".
"They're just kidding.
They like to pinch, they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them the proper respect," he said.
Strands of Hurricane Rosa should bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening by moving over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the entire northern Mexican and southwest U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., Eastern Time Sunday, the Rosa caused bursts of 137 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it begins to form a depression over the Pacific Ocean that moves to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Baja California Peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity northwards in the southwestern U.S.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rains in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain may cause sudden, dangerous floods, floods of debris and possibly landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitations that can reach 5 to 7 mm in one-off zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm precipitation is expected in Southwest areas, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly worsening conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is highly unadvisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Strong precipitation can cause gorges to convert into brave rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong point winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring with it heavy precipitation over parts of the southern California coastline.
Total precipitations of more than 12 mm are possible, which may cause small drains of debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the wet season in the region.
There will begin to occur in Arizona some tropical showers dispersed at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more dispersed at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread in the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October can record strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools down. However, tropical zones will remain quite mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences across the U.S. central area on Sunday.
There's a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern parts of the U.S. will record a hot start of October, with generalized temperatures between 27 and 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of higher than average temperatures occurring in the eastern part of the U.S. until the end of the first half of October.
Over 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million people watched yesterday on six television stations the ravishing testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford has declared to the Senate Judiciary Commission that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while intoxicated and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said that he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, Nielsen's figure on Friday, have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers of the other stations that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulties measuring audiences from those who watch office programs.
To give some perspective, it is a level of audiences similar to the final of a football game or that of the Oscar ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh's nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the audience that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
Next comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protestors while attempting to enter an elevator to address a court hearing.
The senator remained still looking at the ground while it was criticized live for CNN's cameras.
"I am here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event in direct hours later, when the Judiciary Commission went to votes to make Kavanaugh's appointment proceed for a vote in Senate plenary session.
However, Flake stated that he would only do so in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee during the next week, which the Democratic minority had demanded.
Flake was partly convinced after conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politicing" Britain's future and of damaging national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with what he gave on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the Minister's "Chequers Plan" for Brexit, stating that a proposal that provides that Britain and the EU cover the other party's tariffs is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims homicide: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson of the LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in Sims's deadly shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to communications from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police claiming that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered them at the scene of the incident and declared that they had found Simpson's DNA on them, reports WAFB, a CBS branch.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he had mortally shot Wayde with a firearm.
A bail of $350,000 has been established, the lawyer said.
The medical-legal office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head extending to the neck.
The department states that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police action group, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and residents of the area that collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the authorities in the area for their "diligence and effort to get justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
This six-foot-high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "ravaged" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what worries us on a permanent basis," Wade said.
Volcano ejects ashes in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano hit the neighborhoods south of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a recovery of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash within 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on the social networks showed thin layers of gray covering the windshields of automobiles in neighborhoods of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in volcano activity, located 72 kilometres from the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 magnitude shook the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Confrontations between the Catalan police and separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independent protesters and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, arrested by the intervention police, struck it with eggs and threw powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also clashes later, in which the police resorted to batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independentist groups who sang "We haven't forgotten, we haven't forgiven" faced Unionist protesters, who shouted "Long live for Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered in the protests, read in the local press.
Tensions remain high in the region prone to independence, a year after the referendum of 1 October that was considered illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the turnout to the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those against it.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the ongoing vote at voting tables scattered around the region, which resulted in violent clashes.
The independent groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support to the national police.
Although it was carried out, this manifestation was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, aged 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we had our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we are blocked," he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have had difficulty maintaining momentum this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who registered the protest in support of the police with his cell phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for European Parliament in next year's elections.
"Presenting as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car struck repeatedly in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings has stated that damage has occurred to the gates and the building itself.
At a certain point, someone may also have fired a beast at the automobile.
Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, amazed Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference at a time when Gary Holt's team changed their level, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team, which continues without an out-of-home win in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders with eight more points next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended to six games his succession of undefeated matches in the division, with main coach Holt without losing a single time since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against numb visitors
Holt's team should have advanced on the scoreboard long before the goal, as the incisive character of their game was causing Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson entered the defense, but let himself be dragged in front of the goal and then Alan Lithgow managed to direct his effort away only after sneaking to find Craig Halkett's head on the goal.
The house team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors in the stop ball games.
And that's how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers granted a free pass and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, which gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At that point, Rangers dominated the ball's possession, but faced a defense of the impenetrable home team, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no big problems.
This pattern continued in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was thwarted by Rangers' goalie Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another Livingston stop ball move.
Crossroads continued to come to the large area of Livingston, which were successively resolved, and two complaints of great penalty, one after Halkett's assault on the substitute Glenn Middleton and the other after one hand, were rejected by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to overcome expectations in this upward trajectory.
His style of play and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to their fullest throughout the game.
Anyway, Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team fell far short of these standards.
His final move was poorly inspired (only once were able to open the home team), constituting a kind of warning for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters were present in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard, condemning both the President's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with automobile
A cyclist died in a collision involving an automobile in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-west of the city, near 10:15 a.m., British summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died on site.
This collision occurs months after the death of another cyclist in an escape collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform their family members.
Barriers and bus detours were placed, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The riots, which still continue, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 9:30 a.m., British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents "Tornado" were summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to a wing.
The agents were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for Prison Services stated: "Specially trained teams were used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 inmates, among them some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October of last year, intervention police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disturbance in which the personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it is exactly what is expected for the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood notices for Monday and Tuesday, for southern and eastern Nevada, for Southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching at the end of Monday with rains.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within a 300 km radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach 15 mm in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden floods, the rain of the Rose can be a blessing, because the region is affected by the drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation may be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from extreme drought, the second most severe category," said Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the continental mass across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, lies 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to hit the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"Total precipitations of 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora are expected, being possible maximum of 25 mm", reported the site weather.com.
The Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. This will then head south to Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger of Rosa or her remains is the very high rainfall in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora, and in the Southwest Desert of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce sudden floods and floods of waste in the deserts, at risk of life, and flooding on mountainous land.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with sharp gun wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, near 4:00 a.m., British summer time, on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
During the night a 17-year-old teenager, two 18 years old and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area were arrested, reported Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have appealed to anyone who might have cell phone footage of what happened to them.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "was the victim of malice and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "was a victim of malice and anger" of the Democratic party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his claim.
The president stated on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" that day.
"A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a jurist with a brilliant public service resume," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president later referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he talked about the importance of Republican turnout at the polls in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is scheduled to take place by Friday at the latest, a leading deputy of the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of earthquake and tsunami deaths in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them dragged by the gigantic waves that hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, notified the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred following an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities at the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of the event," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency to reduce the effect of the disasters of Indonesia (BNPB) in a communication in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not move alone: it dragged cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastal line.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos published by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and downed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology of Indonesia (BPPT) mentioned in a statement that the energy released by the huge Friday shake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, reads in the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications "were totally incapacitated and there was no information" about Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are over 300 000 inhabitants in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading for the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities claimed that the waves appeared at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage released on social media, one can see a man on the top floor of a building screaming frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to the people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water fell off the coast, dragging buildings and automobiles.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power cut that interrupted communications in the Palu area, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities. However, evacuees still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city's airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palau on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia grows exponentially to over 800.
It's really bad.
Although he managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where the staff are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, World Vision personnel from Donggala went through devastation scenes on his way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when the aid groups began to start the dark tasks of assisting the disaster victims, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and foreign personnel may only have access to the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
This has not yet happened.
"This is still at a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says "OK, this is a national disaster" we can open the door to international assistance, but that statute does not yet exist."
At the fall of the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of the still missing still maintained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that attenuate the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subendono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of the prisoners in the Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior paragliding practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of Hotel Roa Roa began to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages at WhatsApp to the sportsmen of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only one grey check mark instead of a pair of blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take 26 750 USD during refueling of automatic cash in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26 750 from a Brink's employee who was refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was emptying an ATM at the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was intended for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police via number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
By announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West".
West, at the age of 41, received Ye's nickname some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it with "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
At the same time being an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I believe that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year, when he commented on the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the only one," to just Ye - being just a reflection of our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was alternately known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO commits not to resort to military personnel against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador pledged not to use military force against civilians at a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
Military personnel fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have amounted to 300, when leftist student movements were deployed throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving them monthly grants to those studying and opening more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities drag young people into the gangs of criminals.
U.S. should double the funding of artificial intelligence
At a time when China strengthens its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double research spending in this field, said the investor and professional in the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments occur after several U.S. government departments have made announcements related to the AI, even if the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on the matter.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
"Double the research budget in AI would be a good start, given that all other countries are so behind the US and we are in search of the new revolution in AI," Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the chances of the next major success of the AI being achieved by the United States, Lee said to NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello’s top-ranked American player. He later served as executive officer at Microsoft Research and was president of Google’s branch in China.
Lee credited the US government's previous technology competitions as the Defense Department Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
US researchers often have to make a great effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It is not China that is robbing academic leaders; it is companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university luminaries to work in AI.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the US to boost its efforts in the field of AI.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically awarded to PhDs in AI," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that wanted to set up a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence hasn't moved forward in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked their applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbour to the north represents a complaint about its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the population of Macedonia, mostly Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether voting will be sufficient to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you in favour of entering NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the efforts of admission to bodies with the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, aged 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The national election committee stated that there had been no record of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
"I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a capital voter, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change of the name of the country, which would open the door to his accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents assembled by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up and not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can address others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that entry into NATO will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the required turnout.
Another survey, carried out by Telma TV in Macedonia, found that 57% of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the turnout must be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major outburst in the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May of last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses the entire Brighton defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling obliterated Brighton's defense in a 2-0 victory against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine advance received a midfield pass at the start of the play.
He sprinted between Brighton's three defenses before cutting to reach open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He played a defense before he neutralized in the race more others within the limits of Brighton's large area.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The advanced Englishman used his first touch on the large area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with his right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalkeeper with a shot to the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," he told reporters Pep Guardiola, City's coach.
"We said he'd play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal right now."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League match.
That goal was scored at the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball right on Brighton's turf in that play.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave a few taps before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues advance kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field limits.
The City faces Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make it harder for the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
However, the ever competitive Scherzer hopes to enter the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the final for the Rockies, which hold a lead in a game about the Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their first division title.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we can get on the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play to the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting pitcher for Sunday, but some say that they are inclined to allow Scherzer to launch in this situation.
Scherzer, who would do his 34th start, held a bullpen session on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
The right-handed player from Washington goes with 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President later referred to the situation surrounding his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican affluence in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big...I'm not running, but I'm running and so I'm everywhere fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, they're watching it happen right now.
And they're determined to regain power by all means necessary.
They don't care who they hit, who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not giving it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of "resisting and obstructing".
"And they've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, evil, sordid, and lying."
The president referred to the name Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and received booing from the public.
"Remember your answer?
Did you cause the document to escape?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I, wait, one - that was a really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party organization voted to censor me, it wasn't a surprise to me.
At the end of the day, I am the most recent of a number of Labour Members in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday mentioned that "we intend to make the meetings inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today it is no longer the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "kinder and kinder" policy has long been forgotten, if ever it has been realized.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect a turnaround from me and to take positions with which he would never agree - whether they were about national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there follows a torrent of insults on social networks that call for "dismission", denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who's going through this.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never retreat before them.
One of the most disappointing aspects in this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer be inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or change of the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I have received countless advice over the last two years urging me to keep my head down, so as not to be so expressive, and so "it would be all right" for me.
But that's not why I came here to do politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left my comprehensive school classroom literally in rubble, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most, either as mayor or as minister in government.
I've never hidden my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country heads for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "dispatch" or political expedients will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe are the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals somehow biased the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and a better management of the risks that made the house team get the better of it, and Coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They manage the risks better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute essay, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, having Jason Baggot availed himself of an unconverted essay.
Climo extended Ayr's advantage with a great penalty, before, immediately before halftime, he scored and then converted a solo test to put the marker on the 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
There was a long interruption due to a severe injury by Ruaridh Knott, which was transported by stretcher to the exterior and, after the resumption, Ayr reinforced the leadership with a trial of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure attack.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for dropping Climo without the ball, at the penalty launch, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind the maul in progress of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent the Gregor Henry wing to the fifth rehearsal of the house team.
Still Game Star ready for a new career in the restoration business
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems ready to enter the catering sector after it is known that he has been appointed director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and participates with longtime comedian Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, debuting soon, will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was intending to engage in the "flowering Glasgow restoration business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a country devoid of coastline, hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval base covered in rope in La Paz.
Public buildings boast a sea-blue flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Retrieving it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a lost coastline to Chile is still alive in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century, as well as the longing to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point of decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the sentence of the TIJ on giant screens spread across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will resolve in favor of their country's complaint, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign way out to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much at stake in Monday's sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," were the president's votes last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that it would change little even otherwise.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That TIJ's sentence be handed down only six months after the hearing of the closing arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed her.
"The issue of access to the sea was kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined some Chilean residual goodwill, he suggested.
At a time in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain dialogue after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually rapid.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never waive its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"Sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must overcome the past."
North Korea claims that there will be no disarmament without the country trusting the US
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said that his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons unless he trusted Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to keep their promises during a Singapore summit among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments arise when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy at standstill, more than three months after Singapore's summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said that this is an "impossible dream" to consider that the continued sanctions and the objection of the US to a statement that puts an end to the Korean war will ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington is afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang first taking significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to extend your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the runway a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which amazed the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very unpractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the runway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide flap similar to a feather that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included gem watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even an pineapple, although they were not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in time for the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue this immense statement of fashion, you're in luck.
Styling observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of the "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm flap that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very little practical hat that spread through social networks sent another great creation to the catwalks: a beach bag in straw almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that carried it.
The raffia bag in burnt orange, ornate with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the most prominent piece of Jacquemus' 2019 Summer Spring La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm waiting to see big hats and beach bags reach the stores for the next summer. Since the designer had such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, and this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional test results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
The independent schools intend to prepare their students for the further development of their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain a popular theme and sought after in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter his heart."
This quote reminds us that we cannot only depend on English when we want to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year's recent examinations, we found that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum A rating.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained the maximum A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills which will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and not only.
A UK Commission survey on Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for employers’ difficulty in filling vacancies, 17% concerned the lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of competition.
According to a survey by YouGov to more than 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a ratio of two digits, 15%.
So investing now in language teaching is important for today's children.
The domain of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with better chances of finding a relevant job.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK for the 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a set of languages of choice in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills necessary for success, whatever the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages remain of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it on education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "enabled in international communication".
Independent schools will continue to provide this option with diversity and excellence for young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is ending for fans who intend to see LeBron James start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Laker coach, announced that James will be playing the opening game of Sunday's preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes will play is yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48, Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell posted a tweet stating that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game calendar in the preseason.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of conformation waiting for his chosen for the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump intends to strengthen support for the mid-term elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how to see it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below on a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably address this week's hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The vote of confirmation foreseen in the Senate will be on hold for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main goal of this stream of rallies is to help Republicans, who face a difficult election in November, gain some momentum.
Thus, leaders of President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies next week intend to "give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans try to protect and extend the majorities they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is as fundamental to the president's agenda as he will visit as many states as possible, as we approach the agitation of the campaign season," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign who resigned to be cited, Reuters reported.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight may attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and obtain media coverage from the Pittsburgh area," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, outnumbered in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to assist him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates that it has the strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendular oscillation of momentum is a totally invented sports concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say the momentum will come now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now there are four, so we're looking at it as a bit of momentum, I'd say," Jordan Spieth said while he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points in four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural shouts of celebration were getting louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth match an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes back in two.
His putt who won the match in the 15th produced a similar scream, that guy who reveals that he still believes the American team is still in the competition.
"We just need to focus and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but lovely, is four in four and cannot miss.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow to and from this turbulent crowd, the idea is consolidated that they are the players to hit on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European win to the sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the speech on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of this morning's fourballs, when they teamed up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine shoved the Spanish and the Swede into a hole they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursomes session also showed that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, doubted it would have.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last day of the Ryder Cup with a loose advantage after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday matches with a 10-6 lead in front of the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods struggling to reach the ranking at Le Golf National, so far, four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, fighting to conserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the fourballs in the morning, winning the series by 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in foursomes with two winning matches, but failed to shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on the Sunday 12th singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row when he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the only duet to win four points in their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they proudly consolidated the advantage, defeating an energyless Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, revealed occasional accesses of genius, but has already lost 19 of the matches he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the fourballs in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in the world ranking.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze south-west of Paris, Europe has not always been the best.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a brave 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, from Spain, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the foursomes, losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team has reversed a four-point downside before singles, although Furyk's team, who owns the title, only needs to stall to save the trophy.
After two days in second position, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond your range.
North Korea says "no thinking" to unilateral disarmament without confidence
The foreign minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was aggravating mistrust of the United States and that there was no way for the country to unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of the nuclear testing centre and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we see no corresponding US response," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can proceed with our disarmament first."
Although Ri has recycled already known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it takes gradual steps, its statements appear to be significant in that they do not in any way reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast to Pyongyang's previous positions.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between an acting US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim undertook to work towards the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950–53 Korean war, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals to soften the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner, opposing until the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the US leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the party interested in this issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this deadlock".
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was drastically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korean rockets towards U.S. territory was inevitable after "Mr. President Bad" Trump called Kim "the rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to destroy North Korea "completely last year, filled Kim with praise for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but said that there was still much to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea's denuclearisation.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he did not have a calendar for this, stating that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearisation is complete, final and verifiable."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006, in an attempt to strangle the financing of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and declared after visiting Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although later North Korea denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate measures".
Pompeo stated that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they sought were the security guarantees taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course that teaches them to rest long enough.
A new course at Harvard University this year has put all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the macho culture of studying in caffeine-impregnated "directs".
One teacher concluded that the students of this university at the top of the world ranking often had no idea about the most basic concepts of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young woman stated that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, stated that the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to collect to the bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it won't change students' behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the health effects of smoking option," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "direct doing" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we sleep enough and with quality should be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid getting fat, because sleep deprivation puts the brain into hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to your expectations, is to ask all graduate students who attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm for bedtime, as well as waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the electronic screens and LED lighting, which may disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another access of sadness outside the house when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox's team sought to record their first victory in their course since the 1–0 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team eventually inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the Scottish first division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers collective, devoid of inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With Rangers now descending to sixth position, Livingston rises to third, and only behind Hibernian for the difference of goals.
And there may be even more trouble for Rangers after line inspector Calum Spence has received treatment of a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that surpassed the Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, for his part, used the same 11 Livingston who stole a point from Hearts last week, and was delighted by the way his well-oiled team choked opponents on each play.
Rangers may have taken possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored at two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the medium wasted his great opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed only to shoot out toward the second beam.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game in the final third.
Surely Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have been given a great penalty for the fourth hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson refused the Colombian's appeals.
The Rangers only scored two goal shots in the first part, but Ibrox's former goalie Liam Kelly had little to worry about with Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingston's goal at the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected of the game's development, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, let alone its tenacity.
Once again, Rangers couldn't handle a Jacobs long-stop ball game.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple completion.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the advanced side passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly sprinted from its line to perform the blockade.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making a long pass behind a long pass.
Holt's team may have increased their advantage in the final stages, but McGregor held up well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow shot out in the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton once again claimed a major penalty when he tangled with Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: On September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old and continues to Count ...the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When we place these earphones, we can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity on minerals."
Evans: "Look, now it's really crackling!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave his name still endures.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their change in laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a series of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, has seen her cancer in the ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their change in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2. These cells are then again injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
An approach similar to that involving removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a Trump-supported diatribe wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance at the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio at Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump, stating that he would run for President in 2020.
After performing his song of the night, under the name Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat "Make America Great", he started a bravado against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white man and he says to me, "How can you like Trump?
Well, if you were concerned about racism, you would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star plotted Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the scene of West's bravado was published on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West when he did.
Besides, West had complained to the public that he had had a bad time backstage because of his hat.
"They intimidated me backstage.
They said, "Don't go there in that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see marginalization?" saying, "I'd put on my Superman cape, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try love."
His comments provoked public booing and the participants in the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, having someone from the program told the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent".
West had been invited to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love it disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West received a demonstration of support from conservative group director TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TO TURBA".
However, interview show host Karen Hunter published a tweet saying that West was simply "to be what it is, and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (purchasing their music or supporting their "art") who I believe is welcoming and spreading harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that it was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy's past, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Charge of attempted murder after stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public prosecutor.
Star of the Throne War Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a fencer as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO, the War of Thrones.
However, the 31 - year - old actor attacked the stereotype of the sexist hero, claiming that such roles on the screen often make boys feel that they have to be hard to respect.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Rose Leslie Throne War, also at the age of 31, admitted that he has a "very strong position" on the approach to the problem.
"I have a very strong personal position at the moment: what went wrong with masculinity?", he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he said, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel that they must belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for young people."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequel or sequels of the Throne War when the series ended next summer, referring that for him, no more "fields of battle and horses".
As of November, Kit will participate in a reissue of True West by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers that finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Throne War.
"I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple knotted in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected in the country, the health authorities said.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
HIV has traditionally spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual annual variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against the LGBT community is frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90% of men who have had sexual relations with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the disease transmissions derive from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised since 2003 universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information about Republican senators by her collaborator and attacks the "dangerous lies" and the "conspiracy theories"
US Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of her team would have published personal information of three U.S. Senate members on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the charges were being promoted by opinion leaders and "ultra-right" websites.
"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information published allegedly includes the addresses of the homes and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on charges of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with Waters' office and published the data of a Waters staff member, reported The Hill.
"This groundless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denied is a rage," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she doesn't have the temper to be a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot become angry.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
It must reveal calmness and serenity."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate to compete for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," it was read in your tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the competent authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
"We assure you that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally held accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Review Back to Attack - weak parody of spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and this seems in fact to apply to the new edition in the comedy and action series Johnny English, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satisfaction on the subject of being so bad the new opportunity to export to the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes bulging and an overly elastic expression got his license to create confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything, that it is a comprehensive comical creation aimed at non-English cinematographers.
He is, of course, the idiotic secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to a soft glamour, has a little Cloiseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the film "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mystery man whose role Atkinson played in the TV commercials for Barclaycard, which left chaos in his wake.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a chirping noise against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially given that issues of "serious" films such as the 007 and the Impossible Mission now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We get the idea that humor is directed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film numbers in Bean's character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to dismay the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflictive figure, already suffering a total lack of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this role that reminds Theresa May's character, but the argument does not give much material for large flights.
Your secret services advisors inform you that once all active agents have been compromised, you'll have to get someone out of retirement.
And that someone is clumsy Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a fancy school, but teaching unofficial lessons on how to be an undercover spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and join again with his suffering auxiliary Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, hitched to a submarine commander, an exhausting character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of the catastrophe in His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, a role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being dangerously bewitched by the charismatic billionaire of technologies who claim to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd clumsy acts: disguised as waiters, they ignite a showy French restaurant, create confusion penetrating as clandestine on Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy when it tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize itself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but as friendly and stormy as it is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite average.
And just as in Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but wonder: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that will do justice to his talent?
Laborers are denying that they're working on a plan for the British to work four days a week, but getting five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day workweek, but with five paid days.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to pass on savings with the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the workers, granting them a supplementary day off.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping their pay.
Sources say that the idea would "adjust" to the party's economic programme, which redirects the country to the benefit of workers.
The move to a four-day workweek obtained the favourable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official said to The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration adjusted to the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the party's overall strategy for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day workweek during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not at the moment favored by the whole Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it".
Shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain the power of the hands of the faceless "directors" and the "speculators" of the basic service companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the total share of current water company shareholders, as the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of unlawful conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place employees on the company's board of directors and create Inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share from private companies to employees, which can pocket dividends that can amount to £500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation Kavanaugh can make them change their minds or not
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions as to whether the conclusions could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their minds.
Kennedy proved to be but open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I was going to the hearing, I said, "I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when this allegation came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's vote, however, seems unmovable.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be necessary," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will perform on an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in the Great Revolvement of Central Park, not only to watch performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real objective of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defense group that hopes to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or any other significant ways that would help increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "clickivism" - do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, there have been more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters who have put pressure on them to achieve a number of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed so that world leaders had announced commitments and policies valued at more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, with at least 10 billion dollars related to them already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to "helping children achieve their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help put an end to malnutrition in the country. This was after receiving more than 4700 Global Citizens tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote to history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5000 pressure actions on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the site's frequent questions, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replies: "It was a long and crooked way - sometimes we fell and failed.
But just like the great civil and anti-apartheid rights movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA can use the Navy as a "block" to put a hindrance to Russia's energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington can resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including in the Middle East, revealed U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, namely, where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploiting new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to stop him.
"The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants at an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stating that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "magic of one trick" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of natural gas to Europe in place of Russia, which is the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration authorities, including the president himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "inadequate" Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream pipeline, budgeted at 11 billion dollars, intends to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position motivated a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the German Federation (BDI)'s senior manager following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply examine" the possibility of running for president in 2020, said the Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she will "deeply examine" the possibility of running for president after the mid-term elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the ultimate guardian," The Hill said.
"After November 6, I will look deeply at the possibility of running for president."
Warren commented to President Donald Trump during the informal debate, stating that "he was taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey carried out on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's own constituents are not of the opinion that he should run for president in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not apply, according to the poll of the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Center.
32% support your candidacy.
The survey revealed greater support for a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated regarding a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden stated that he would officially decide in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's post-traumatic stress at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through after he has returned, I can identify with other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers actually come back with," he told the public of a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and stated that his son and other veterans "come back a little different, come back hardened, come back wondering if there is such respect for what their comrades soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave to the country".
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district sent a statement amicus curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is contesting this policy, said NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union brought in August against politics was not revealed.
The person stated that his partner "and his sons, members of a violent gang," abused him, but the US authorities rejected his asylum application on July 20.
The plaintiff was arrested in Texas.
Public ministries supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 Immigrant Resource Board decision that allowed immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine stated, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates that principle", reads in the Amicus Curiae statement.
Lawyers also argued in this statement that the arrest by the immigration police negatively affects the U.S. economy, stating that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "disable the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of politics on June 11.
The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of dead doubles in a counterclockwise to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, the mother of a male febrile baby, comforting him in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water."
Residents were sighted returning to their homes destroyed to try to save everything they could find from their water-soaked belongings.
There were hundreds injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured the ribs and shoulder, rested outside Palu Army Hospital, where the patients were treated abroad due to the strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he reported how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "advertising announcements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four - page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid supplement to the Des Moines Register, Iowa State's most printed newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 elections to Congress, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked the beginning of what the American authorities, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff vacancies on imports from the other.
China's retaliation tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump's Republican Party, say Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register Sunday, "is now setting foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertising ads in our free press".
"With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of free speech and press publishing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"On the other hand, in the stalls here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a real reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have from the worrying economic trajectory of their country, because the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters before midterm elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
At a time when many important Republicans support and defend the nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various charges of sexual assault, analysts warn that this may provoke a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move on to a vote.
These things have no backlash," he gave to The Hill Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher stated that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute pressure to conduct an FBI investigation would be sufficient to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," said on Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is at the door!" when they manifested themselves in the Senate lobby, given that the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all records," said news website Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst without party affiliation.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among the undecided voters in suburban areas and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans advanced with confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge. It's also about how Republicans handled it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new poll by YouGov revealed that 41% of respondents believed in Ford's testimony or probably believed in him, while 35% claimed that they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% stated that they considered Kavanaugh to have probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's proposal, the FBI began an investigation into Ford's allegations as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to Guardian.
Ford reported under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually molested her while she was intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee for the Supreme Court exposed his genitals when they both attended a party during the period they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary character of technologies, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the underlying intention of Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said with regard to startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage", or POD.
It may contain contact lists, job lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data store is that it is up to the user only to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through the data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a publication on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even as he launches the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: homage to clergyman decorated with Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman in the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a combatant was honored in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren descended a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, claimed that it was "brightly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the achievement he gave his grandfather the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the crossing of the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under heavy fire of portable weapons and machine guns".
Then he ran into the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before attacking alone a cannon and shooting down three soldiers from the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never match, but also a lesson in humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a wreath of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is to be demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people".
Mixed martial arts fans awake all night to see Bellator 206 instead watch Porca Peppa
Imagine this: you stay up all night to see Bellator 206, full of stars and, in the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 matches, with six of the main group, and was being aired live during the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, viewers in the UK were amazed when the coverage moved to Porca Peppa.
Some were not impressed after being up until dawn especially for combat.
A Twitter fan described the move to cartoons for children as "a kind of bad joke".
"Government regulation says the content is not suitable for 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to another program," said Dave Schwartz, administrator with the marketing and communications portfolio, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig," yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that it will correct the timing of transmissions to include UK viewers in the future.
"I believe that when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem," said Coker.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there and we can't solve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and no very nice ones.
We're trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise next time it won't happen.
We'll reduce the number of combats to five instead of six, as we normally do.
It's a pitiful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claimed that he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that this gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he got into high school that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview with Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he stated that he expressed himself in favor of homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also claimed that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympic Games.
The program's longtime regular host, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a pariah in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
In his words, "to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and strength to achieve success."
His goal was to prove that he was "someone," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "caught me by surprise".
Daley married last year to the Oscar winner, 20 years older, although he claimed that the age difference was never a problem.
"When we went through so much when we were so young" - his first participation in the Olympic Games was at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son last year, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley stated that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, all that mattered was to win a gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the London games in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that "you won't be around to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that this was what I had dreamed my whole life: diving before a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games...there was no better feeling," he said.
All this was also the inspiration of her first choice of song - Proud, by Heather Small - with which she had identified herself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, British summer time.
Mickelson in low form at the bank at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will reach a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to regain his shape to prevent the landmark from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record for appearances, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk at fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has so many times been in the United States teams, the five-time winner of the male major championships divided the day between the supporting function and the work in his field play, hoping to rectify what afflicts him.
Never having played the straightest shots even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old player is not ideal for the National Le Golf field, where the long rough usually punishes the wandering strokes.
And if the field alone was not intimidating enough, Mickelson, in the ninth Sunday match, will face the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four matches they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage starting the 12 singles matches, record a good start, Mickelson's match may prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could assert much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said it would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a respected champion who's given a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't seen him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to move on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass on Sunday the record of Nick Faldo of the highest number of matches played in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never even matched the successes of your individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk claimed that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and witty, likes to play with people and is an excellent person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun messing with him too this week, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear at an apex.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his loose leadership when entering the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily become a rough ride.
The Danish had their debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros retained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the narrowest of the margins, winning by 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but barely," said Bjorn, in the image, after having watched the victory of the Class 2018 by 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead by 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this isn't over yet.
Tomorrow, give it your best shot.
Go out there and do everything right.
This isn't over until we get the dots on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus must remain.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enchanted by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance myself on this.
Tomorrow's a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is the individual performances and that involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the full.
This is the message that must be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they'll abandon their partner and he has to go and give the best of himself as well."
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will look for his players to perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big twists on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe pulled the Miracle in Medinah out of the hat.
"I remember every word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum moves to one side, the pressure is too great in these middle matches.
We organized our staff accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we're going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of planning.
"I chose this group of players by this order because I believe it covers the whole path," Bjorn said about their choices for singles.
New German warship once again postponed
The latest German navy frigate should have joined the service in 2014 to replace Cold War time warships. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to breakdowns and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the brand-new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships that the Navy had commissioned in 2007 will serve to replace the aged Bremen class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include more extended periods between maintenance, which would allow the most recent frigates to be sent on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuing delays have made that with the state-of-the-art warships, considered as a way for Germany to project power across borders, they will already be out of date by the time they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cite a number of crucial hardware and software defects that would make the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The deficiencies of the software were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the quota needed in the oldest frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the navy's ability to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7000 tons, is twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it will have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion, an increase from the initially budgeted EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems that plague the latest frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defense committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used."
The politician said that the problem grew exponentially over time, because older ships were put out of service without vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to join the navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
Further investigations are being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and fruit bats, as well as long-eared browns and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered around the property to follow the activities of bats along the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS personnel and volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, an advisor for the conservation of the nature of the NTS, expects the results to reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect the dormitories and make the habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a threat, together with flypapers and some chemical treatments of construction materials, in addition to attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo localization technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies, inspections of dormitories and sometimes rescues.
He also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The owner of the property, David Thompson, says it's the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about the bats we do not know, so the work we do here and in the other properties will help us to know more about what they need to flourish".
He highlighted the importance of checking for bats before maintaining the properties, as the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it's illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish chief of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
It was said by her: "We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply do not know how their populations are taking revenge".
Ronaldo denies charges of rape when his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news", stating that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The advance in the Portuguese team and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he will then have paid $375 000 to keep the alleged victim silent about the accident, reads on Friday's Der Spiegel.
Speaking of a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, at the age of 33, characterized the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the winner of five Golden Balls to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy home and everything's fine," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, which they characterized as "an unacceptable report of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would demand compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he had violated her anally, according to the documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told him it was "99%" "a good guy", damaged by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she addressed the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to enter into an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "terrorized by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims that she intends to cancel the agreement because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged assault. This summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a business of 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom would "repent forever" from losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in automobile manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary for Greg Clark Enterprises.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays at borders in the case of a Brexit without an agreement could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Great Britain leaves the EU disorderly by the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom expressed concerns about the exit of the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said that it would close its Minis plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what manufacturers claim to be the supply chain risks in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on a just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, border disturbances may occur, which the sector says may lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark stated that Theresa May's "Chequers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the use by us of this opportunity," said BBC Radio Today.
"The evidence not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although Toyota could not give an estimate of the stopping time, it stated that, in the long term, the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could sooner or later lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union on this site, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said that "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "another week later" as there is still no understanding of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's advisors and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump may be preparing the dismissal of the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House, with information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not to fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Justice Commission hearing in which they witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation lasting a week on the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press advisor Sarah Sanders took part in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been set, it may be this week but it can also be postponed another week, given everything that has been going on in the Supreme Court.
I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said that "I would not disagree with the fact that they like the lead."
He then implied that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President has more questions and answers sessions than any previous president," he said, adding, without gathering evidence: "We have analyzed these numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do so often and they have seen that we have done so in recent weeks, and the fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences when receiving foreign representatives.
Soil press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way before the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers in the Scottish National Health Service on the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and to request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after leaving the EU UK.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to funding applications for resident status for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "Over the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued and decisions were expected for this autumn.
But the UK government has also speeded up preparations for a possible outgoing scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at the moment how much I value the contribution of each official, regardless of their nationalities.
Colleagues from across the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie submitted to emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers' defense, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's defeat by 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tigers reported.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He approached the sideline and practically fainted," Reed said.
The technical team and medical personnel placed Abercrombie on the sideline before laying him on a stretcher and transporting him for further evaluation.
A representative of the team told Chris Harris of the Nashville WSMV, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He scored five scores on Saturday before leaving the game, which brings his total of the season to 18 scoreboards.
A higher stamp tax will be levied on foreign buyers when acquiring property in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher stamp tax on foreign buyers who acquire property in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in the aid to the homeless
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the youngest electorate
The increase in the stamp tax will relate to buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to GBP 120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp tax rate will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in the aid to the homeless, today will be announced Theresa May.
The measure is viewed as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and tax higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will focus on persons and companies not taxed in the UK, with the additional revenue boosting the government's campaign to offer a roof to the homeless.
The surcharge - added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and rent purchases - may amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to GBP 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, raising prices and making it difficult for first-place buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy arises weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a cut of the stamp tax to help young people acquire their first dwelling.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by hoarding land that they do not use, demanding that Mrs. May abandon quotas on affordable housing to resolve the "disgrace of accommodation" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an appealing set of proposals for housing reform, including rent controls and the end of "no justification" evictions.
It also wants to give municipalities extended powers for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is so easy to buy homes for people living outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as for resident British workers.
For too many people the dream of owning their home has become too distant and the shame of those who sleep in the open remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross stated that his "ambitious slip" is to become Scotland's picker.
The 42-year-old Scotsman has been successful in giving new life to the northeast club, currently third ranked in the First League, three points away from the leadership.
He transferred to the Stadium of Light this summer after directing St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division last season.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalization," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and those are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if it succeeds in club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former coach says he was not afraid of succeeding such well-known names in such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, right now, success comes down to "can I take the club back to the Premier League?"
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to get the club back, but I'll only consider that I was successful here when I reach that goal."
Ross' coaching career is only three years old, after a period as Dumbarton's assistant coach and 15 months on the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent into the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of demotion to the title of champion at the following time.
Ross points out that he feels more comfortable now than he has ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa "it was a real crossroads," remember.
"I've always seen myself more in the role of coach than in the role of player.
It seems strange because it went well, I made my living as a player and had some high moments in my career.
But gambling can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and pressure of the position, but I feel pretty good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train, and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I've ever felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Restoration groups experienced a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but the occupation of restaurants decreased by 4.8%, statistics show.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of good weather and England's career in the longer than expected World Cup, caused the pattern of June, in which pubs recorded a growth of 2.8% in sales, to be repeated in July, but restaurants experienced a retreat.
The decrease of 1.8% recorded in the sales of the restoration in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the liquor-based business had by far the best performance, with a homologous growth that more than compensated for the decline of restaurants.
The pubs with the meal-based business also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks rose by 6.6% throughout the month, with meals retreating by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and restoration RSM, said: "These results prolong the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events remain the main factors influencing the sales of the out-of-home food market.
It is not surprising that restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual fall in sales of 4.8% is particularly damaging when added to the extension of cost pressure.
The long and warm summer could not come at a worse time for operators with the business based on meals. Only time will tell if the mildest temperatures we know in August will provide the much desired relief."
The growth of the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry indicator for the sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, being recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in five children hidden from parents secret accounts on social networks
One in five children - some only 11 years old - has secret accounts on social networks that hide from parents and teachers, revealed a study
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth in "false" Instagram pages
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children - some only 11 years old - creates accounts on the social networks they hide from adults.
An inquiry with 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth of "false" accounts on the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have an innocuous "principal" account to show their parents, simultaneously possessing private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found that Teenager was inciting others to "rape her."
The study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of young people between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, half of which admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the Governor's annual General Assembly.
President Ian Beattie described the nomination as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have much to gain from his presence in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be able to act like the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute truly to helping guide sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 - 400 - meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, stopped being able to walk after suffering a transitory ischaemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter, "I had a stroke a month ago today.
I can't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if it could recover and to what extent.
It's been a painful job but I've achieved a full recovery, I've learned to walk again and I've even done agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Announcement of milk extraction pump compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A milk pump company shared online opinions with an ad that compares mothers who breastfeed cows in milking.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first portable silent milk extraction pump", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic announcement inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom conferred by the new pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled cowland to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail," and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The chorus goes, "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk my girls."
However, the announcement published on the company's Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that the "horrors" of the dairy sector are smooth.
"Third decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born," wrote a viewer.
The Elvie extraction pump fits discreetly inside a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to announce an extraction bomb to mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone also said, "An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but it makes perfect sense.
This product is genius," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad addressed to mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or in the workplace) and feel like "cows".
It is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy sector."
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discrete bombs lodged in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies and even leave the house while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women extracting milk and dairy cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was a headline.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded on the runway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained reached a peak, although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the rhetoric and severe policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most of the "fathers" are undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults integrating their households would have to record their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior employee of the Customs and Immigration Service, testified before Congress that the service held dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Near 80% of the godparents or members of their respective households are illegal in the country, many of them being foreigners with criminal record.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to the staff of the reception centres.
Many are present by video conferencing, not in person, to defend their request for legal status before a judge of the immigration court.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer children remain detained, the greater the likelihood of feeling anxious or depressed, which can lead to access to violence or attempts to escape, according to the staff of the reception centres and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say that these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as those in Tornillo, where the large dimension contributes to ignoring the signs of disturbance of children.
They add that the transfer of the children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends worsens the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal of American, French and Turkish "occupancy forces"
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees home, although the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they will "be treated as such".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has left millions displaced.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the question of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to remain abroad.
"We ask the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement established "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the contestation and scandals end their presidency in advance.
In the one that would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic finale of an ever presidency"!
At the moment, there's no sign of weariness from the viewers.
Since 2014, prime time hearings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primetime viewers, a rise to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on the big news nights.
"This is a strong decoy for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC "Designed Survivor" program, about a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember once he called a cab in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he was voting Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos have entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television programmes, stories from Washington can determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family gathering of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's more than being an informed citizen when we're watching the sixth hour of an expert debate on Bob Woodward's use of "with deep knowledge" sources in his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("a garment full of insolence", as the Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's... um... anatomy of President Trump.
For my part, I'll never face Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's been doing seems like a reality show because he gives us something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's dynamic cast and the daily twists of the plot (antagonize with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
We can't miss an episode or get left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, there were 26 degrees off the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up at home, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was not disgruntled from television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify before the Senate Justice Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said: this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right after all."

Significant external funding in the mid-term elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th circle of Pennsylvania knows an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of the constituencies that left two holders in the race for the same place.
The recent readjustment of Pittsburg's suburban circles put in the race Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb runs against another titular, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old circles would unconstitutionally favor the Republicans.
The race for the 17th circle sparked a fierce dispute over the financing of the campaign between the financial arms of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the extremely disputed extraordinary elections of March for the 18th constituency of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This seat had been occupied for over a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked Trump Organization out of the board.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call the leaders of the U.S. diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the State Department, in a statement this month.
But sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million of American aid in 2017, including for the control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The penalties proposed, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have harshly penalised this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
With the continuation of internal meetings, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in the middle of September, top officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations covered by anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be dropped may be the report of legal adviser Robert Mueller on Mr Trump's possible obstruction of justice, on which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller is allegedly guiding his investigation into whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
Should Congress change hands, Trump will face accountability on the part of that body, while preparing to introduce himself again to the voters and perhaps to be judged by his peers.
That's a lot of chances, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, or that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices we have to make from both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of combat.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup d'état, provided the West had resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around points of inflection such as this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
The Americans are currently facing several of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this paper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating on his inability to perform the position.
Rosenstein says the news from The Times is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechish Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she told me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With an inheritance like this, how could you not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the optimist Rangers before the game with the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in the Europa League G Group.
A knee injury prevented the middle Graham Dorrans from playing the first game of the season until the draw to two goals with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a trampoline for higher flights.
"It was a point well won by us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We ran the game with a positive mindset and got a point.
Maybe we could have won close to the end, but overall, the draw was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the support of the audience, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year was very hard, with all my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can do our best, forget about the past time and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep with fear of this savings-reform account
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey have a clear idea of the type of care they want to receive, few people have talked to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals questioned in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children on the same subject.
"People want a family member to take care of you, but they're not having that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not give them their wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and family, discussing where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Your continued care financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid monetary valuation policy to help cover such expenses or financing using your own savings, provided you have those available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Nominate a health care prosecutor by choosing a person of your trust to supervise your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the constitution of a power of attorney over your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only are financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What's the medication?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air pressure on his way home after a night in town.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was struck in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have requested witnesses.
Sisms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
With communications interrupted, the rescuers failed to obtain any information from the Donggala region, a zone north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Central Province, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that extends over 300 km of coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status lower than that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Fire Ring and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26 a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, originated a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes reached the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 magnitude hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, originating a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude reached the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29 - year - old Palin, residing in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is detained preventively at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention center, subject to $500 bail, reported to KTUU.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," reported the station.
Palin faces charges for three Class A offenses, which means he could be sentenced to a sentence of up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B felony, punishable with a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the complaint of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
Your girlfriend accused you of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran associations after associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress due to her service in Iraq.
Sism and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died following an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake originated a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks have been cut, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the Sulawesi Central region, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Prosecutor asks rare capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The New York D.A. is asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an October attack on a bike track on West Side Highway, downtown Manhattan, running over pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder in the service of organized crime, usually used by the prosecution in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and premeditation," said the prosecutors, describing how Saipov executed him as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and losses to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the notification.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South Zone of New York hasn't asked for the death penalty for an indictment in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but the sentence was commuted to life in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favor of the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court's documentation, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He declared to the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty on all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense attorneys, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the accusers not to ask for the death penalty.

Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should "feel pressure" from the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's Members suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Rear Conservative deputy Peter Bone said at Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "already left" if Farage were Brexit's Minister.
But Mrs. May's challenge to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionaries was underlined by the conservatives who defend permanence, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has been struggling to maintain her commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit's supporters, supporters of permanence and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to end the plan.
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would have left by now," he said.
Wellingborough's deputy added, "I'll continue to defend Brexit but we should end the plan."
Reinforcing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone refused the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is totally inappropriate".
The conservative defender of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, saying to journalists: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the street and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Cheque Plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "Only the prime ministers who know how to keep promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "feel pressure" if they lend themselves to betraying the decision out of the 2016 referendum.
"This became a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them they're not gonna get away with it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to press our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, proud United Kingdom and rule itself."
Meanwhile, the supporters of the stay marched to Birmingham before organizing a two - hour rally in the city centre.
A crowd of activists engaged tracks with the message "Conservators against Brexit" after the group's release this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with a party application at the opening of the Congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'Canada more', for the border without friction, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren plans to "consider seriously" the possible nomination for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider the candidacy for President" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular review by President Donald Trump, is a candidate for re-election in November against Republican deputy Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It has been speculated that you will be able to face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump's inauguration.
One of the participants asked him if he was planning to run for President.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to correct our government's problems and that includes a woman in the top place.
Detention under the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot down near the Southern University campus early on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head following which he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to his presence at the scene, wielding a gun, recognizing that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a five-foot junior created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and held 10 times last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position in the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went to the pits and made Hamilton face the traffic from the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes went to the pits one lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton surpassed him after a close skirmish, after which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly left the inside of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double path correction to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, changing tires too late, which would allow him to be quick in the final part, aiming to overcome Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He ended up in boxing on the 44th lap but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to end in fourth.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me get over it.
The team did exceptional work, which allowed us to end up in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because of his insistence that he did not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking of a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford's testimony to the Senate Justice Commission, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad, malicious and false".
"Look at the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate in the last few days, look at the anger, see how bad, malicious and false people are," Trump said.
"When we see the leaks and the communications and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape come from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't come from me.'
Well, wait a minute.
The escape started from us... No, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "You know what, that was bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the nominee for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see evil, malice, no matter who they can hit, anyone who has to tread to take power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants by 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from defeat on Friday in the First Division match against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand by 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants gained an initial advantage from two goals with the goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the house team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
François Bouchard tied to Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had achieved a twist on Friday night at Belfast, defeating Dundee by 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal emerged at the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford attending Beauvillier increasing the advantage four minutes later.
In a frenzied first period, Sullivan put the house team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie the draw at 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants that they would reach the first break in the lead, scoring their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The house team reorganized and Bouchard tied again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen take Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, ensuring victory by scoring the fifth goal of the team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after his death by ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, originating a tsunami.
Rebuttal potentials continue to ravage the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post while the control tower was shaking violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained focused to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, would take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower in the face of the imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for the Indonesian air navigation agency, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian television network ABC News.
We sent a Balikpapan helicopter to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We were devastated by this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach thousands, referring to the country's disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by debris that we have not yet been able to rescue," said the spokesperson for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral takes place on Sunday.
Commercial and military planes are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The minimarkets are being pillaged everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces on the spot and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete evacuation operations.
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that took the lives of more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that there is a man missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a man missing after reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the plane sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini stated that since Saturday afternoon, it was unable to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The area company claimed to be collaborating with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Official authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline advanced that six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
It is not yet known for certain what the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events was.
The U.S. airline and Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane could not reach the runway and loved it in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone off track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, claimed that the plane was very low.
"It was the best that ever happened," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other people had managed to drag water down the waist and get to the emergency exits of the plane sinking.
He told them that the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, the sailors who were working on a work of improving a nearby jetty also helped in the rescue by resorting to an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank to 30 metres (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday at the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used his cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of the 20-year-old defendant Quintom Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber, the night of his death.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several mobile phones that confirm that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that your phone was with Chambers at the time you claimed to have been with your friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and claimed he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville."
Another incongruity in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Cell phone records indicated they'd only known each other a week ago.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis erased the SMS messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin making its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be examined by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The Bristol High Breed group claims that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to go back to those roots and return popularity to conscientious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent reborn in the UK thanks to the intervention of other interpreters such as Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal through a "racist" text message
A nanny from New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was "one more black."
The couple denied the accusations of racism, stating that the process was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, demonstrated some fear when she discovered that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she presented herself for her first day of work in 2016.
"I CAN'T BELIEVE... ONE MORE BLACK," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when he realized his gaffe, a "burdened" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the poor performance of the previous African American nanny and was waiting for a Filipino nanny.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent home from Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and asking for a compensation of 350 USD/day for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't go unpunished," he said to the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical because they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent him something she didn't really want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Did you trust your children with someone you'd treated badly, even by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I don't believe it."
In calling the process "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had only been a mother two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to chase someone like that?
It's not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the legal process takes place, the court of public opinion was quick to condemn the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers might not identify with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, thus commented on the letter: "It is difficult for us to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's so much fun to hear this now, after Paddington's been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little bear playing with the children's book, would not have taken it to heart if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication had a bittersweet flavor given his passing last year.
About Paddington, who described him as "a very important member of our family," said his father was very proud of his success.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to bragging," he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we were proud even when it wasn't our doing.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Though it was the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on my phone.
Soon after landing, the daughter had been taken by emergency to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of surviving," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"So Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medicines that the doctors had given him to keep his heart running were slowly failing to work and leaving his system.
He'd been dead for a while and all his organs were shutting down.
I had to stand there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stop myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers outside the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I cried all the time with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women post bridge cards to avoid suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide fight to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any father to have to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Sharon Davis, a 45-year-old resident of Lydney, said his son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it lit up the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had "dipped into darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible repercussion."
Sharon Davis created the postcards "to let you know that there are people who are available to help and who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't lock yourselves in.
Kelly Humphreys, longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his companion 15 years ago, very shortly after his mother-in-law's death.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in your behavior.
When the kids opened their presents, they didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "It destroys a family.
No one's indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation.
"I thought that having what I had asked for - an investigation with defined time and scope - we could be more united," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, advancing that he feared that the committee would be "falling apart" in the face of a rooted party impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is merely a temporal issue.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their frustrated Supreme Court candidate.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met Bush's wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at that time.
What happens after the FBI submits their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, currently seating 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tiebreaker vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean deserters decreased during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters to North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's rise to power seven years ago.
citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 desertions occurred last year compared to 2706 2011.
Park stated that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers of people asked for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang made no public statement.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean deserters.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal and non-refugee migrants, and often repatriates them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearisation negotiations that are at an impasse.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Ministers, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, minority leader in the House, said Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotively denied all sexual abuse legacy to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a loud and sobbing voice, when he spoke of his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly accused the Democrats of the commission, dubbed the allegations made against him of a "grotesque and conspiratorial murder" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court given his prejudiced behavior against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
When asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's actual appointment and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you do not have the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of D.C.
Pelosi added that while a Democrat, he feared Kavanaugh's potential opinions against the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, as he enjoyed the fame of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh outlined questions about the possibility of repealing certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women have to be able to control their emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and you can't get it off your chest without crying.
"We cried when we got angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something weird, do you?"
A woman with an executive position at some company helped me a lot. She told me that she cried when she got angry too, but she had created a technique. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant." Mrs. Steinem continued.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well that, in an old job in an office dominated by men in whom I cried with inexpressible anger, being held by the neck by an older woman - an unfriendly manager who terrorized me a little - and literally dragged down the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're mad.
They think you're sad and they're gonna be glad they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the date of Democratic Congresswoman of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business and gave up her candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not run for president herself.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," he told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who nicknamed the situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Given its late entry, the fundraising was below desirable and swore that it would only enter the race if it could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found out that some of his sympathizers would only give him $250, although they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter a formal campaign, emotions came to the fore - gratitude for the people who had supported him, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and bring the message to the voters instead of the delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears arose.
"It seemed like she was depressed," she recalled Patricia Schroeder when she spoke of the media reaction.
"I would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
What would they write in my epitaph now?
"She cried"?
How trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial for Beijing
The first salvo of the trade war between the U.S. and China was deafening, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the experts' perspective, the remoteness of the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning at the beginning of the year by charging important Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was the scene of a significant worsening of the situation with the new rates affecting goods worth 200 billion dollars (GBP 150 billion), actually charging half of all goods shipped from China to the U.S.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, rising recently the rates from 5 to 10 percent for US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has committed itself to following in the footsteps of the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will falter in the near future.
Taking Washington back would mean succumbing to demands, but showing a public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the US can positively sustain China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In fact, the fact that an untimely political decision from Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Minister for Foreign Affairs states that Syria is prepared for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country’s conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have abandoned because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly receive aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he pointed out that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from the countries that sponsored the revolt.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European national team beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. now accumulates six consecutive losses on European soil since they last won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe again crowns itself victorious after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who demonstrated serious difficulties during almost the entire tournament, threw the starting tee into the water in hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst ranked player of the European national team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England in what may have been his last appearance in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most award-winning European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"It's not my habit to cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so glad we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
Pass the word to his countryman Jon Rham who defeated the legend of American golf, Tiger Woods, by 2&1 in singulars on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 major titles won and just beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the remaining members of the U.S. team struggled to reach the fairway.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the disappointing performance of his team.
This tomorrow, we can put some fear into Europe.
We fought.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of your players were excellent.
We will reorganize and I will collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move on.
I like a lot of these 12 players, and I'm proud to be your captain.
I have to take my hat off the other team.
They were better."
