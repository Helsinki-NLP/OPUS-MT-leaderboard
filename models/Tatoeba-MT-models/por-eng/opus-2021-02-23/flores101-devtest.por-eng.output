This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but also offers details that are not found so often in fossils, such as colors and the three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the lower part was clear or carotenoid.
The discovery also gives clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
The feathers of dinosaurs, known as raque, do not have a well developed stem, but have other characteristics, such as splinters and bárbulas. In view of this, researchers concluded that the raque was possibly the result of an evolutionary development after these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather to display or regulate the temperature. Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, not that of a cub.
The researchers suggested that, although the tail is of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult plumage, not a feather.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin and deposit a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officers verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.

Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process. During the night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

His other race, the Giant Slalom, gained the tenth position in the group of women seated with a combined score of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 slower than the first placed Australian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 slower minutes than the ninth placed Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers on the Giant Slalom failed to qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped Swiss and recovered your phone and laptop."
The accused were named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused attended the court with his face covered, police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki declared.
Although three people were inside the house when she was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital at Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court ever since, charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody while waiting to be indicted and tried, but any evidence of eyewitnesses may be compromised because her image has been widely disclosed.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's justice acts differently, and the courts consider photo publishing to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists seem to go in a dangerous direction when publishing photos, videos, etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the proceedings, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other matters covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requires a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years as soon as an agreement is signed, while the AP agrees to leave that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test were under close supervision of the forest engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, according to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Park Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth zip code in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the CEP be renounced as part of a package of measures to advance the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to the general protests organized against the regime. The demonstrations began in October.
Occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with light burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 devices-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed him of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company classified as "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truely regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m., local time. At GMT time, it was Friday, 9:19 p.m.
The emergency management office of the Northern Marianas said there was no reported damage in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Alert Center said there was no indication of tsunami.
A former Filipino cop kidnapped a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers then took the place of an old lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He educated as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Although Liggins was working at the hospital, he began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes, flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme, my first businesswoman, Luna passed away on a night with two moons, something exceptional, just like her, strong woman."
Dustin Goldust Runnels said, "Luna was as crazy as I am... or maybe even more... I loved her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those opposed to change in Australia, for it to become a republic, has increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 national election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the research share this vision, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 metres free and in three turns at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his grievances, his physical condition was questioned.
He could not take the necessary medicines to overcome the pain, since these are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the Central University of Missouri, discovered the largest prime known until January 25.
Several people proved the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have been a source of water distribution to the earth along with organic matter that can develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collide with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his government earlier this year and signed a law in the last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as being "politication and nonsense"
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that FAA says would let aircraft fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon production.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and connections with public transport will not be available.
The problem of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would have to be held behind closed doors, without the presence of the fan.
On Thursday, Science magazine published a study reporting the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to the reproduction between an endemic finch Darwin, Geospiza forts, and the finch immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can even be wrapped in small shapes.
It is possible to stretch to form a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or wrapped in leaves.
It can be very thin and glued to another metal. Because it is so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted paintings in books called "lit manuscripts".
This is called chemical PH. You can make a marker using purple cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkalin) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, mold them into the shape of a ball.
The moisture of the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flushing toilet seat in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remaining parts of sewage systems were found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in Ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathrooms, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel did for us was to give us a much easier and faster transport.
He gave us the train, the car and several other forms of transport.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat small animals, much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The revelation to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat does that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called packs.
The flocks consist of one to three adult males of the same family, along with up to 30 females and cubs.
Women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Gender Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the roaring of a lion's whole voice, but more like a phrase of screamed and growling words.
Jaguatiricas like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they succeed. Almost all the animals that jaguatirica hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that jaguatiricas follow and find their prey by smell, sniffing where they have been through the soil.
They can see very well in the dark with the night vision and can also move stealthyly. The jaguatiricas hunt their prey by mixing with the environment around them and then attack their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separate from the main population from where they came from (e.g., they transpose a mountain range or a river, or go to an island from which it is not possible to return easily), it often sees itself in a different environment than the one in which it once lived.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from those they already have and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process of speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale)
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also offer shade.
We built our homes using plants and we made our clothes using plants, and most of the food we consume is plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of his era, so the only thing he feared were other Mosasauruses.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of his mouth, which shows that nothing that crossed his path could escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex would be no match for him.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snail and a type of rodent called arganaz.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides while making their meals.
Food in ancient Rome did not include supplies originating from America and Asia to Europe, as it did in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomato, no potato, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which were considered the house of their respective gods.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary in which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers - shaped pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, the shops were only open counters facing the street. Stones were used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had its colonization sparsely. In the Nordic sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while traveling west, found Greenland and gave it that name.
But regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all countries were "scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have ever seen the movie The Legend of the Lost Treasure, you may find that a treasure map was drawn in the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Declaration of Original Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears in the lower corner of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that, at the beginning of its existence, the great parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped to be stored.
Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and the following battles on D-Day freed northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". They were French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the American forces and Free France had freed the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to Latin civilians, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also, in some way, defines the size of society.
The cities-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilization perceives the transfer of knowledge for different generations, a lasting cultural reach and a just dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — Congress being its only component — according to the Articles of the Confederation.
Congress lacked power to demand tributes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, which generally did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
Furthermore, there was no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent among all states before they could be amended and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italian football team, together with the German team, is the second most successful in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, skate hockey and F1 races.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago"
The foundation of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans sailing through the region named the site Taiwan Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company inaugurated a base in southwestern Taiwan, starting a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan to be a Qing Empire province in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it granted sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex were rebuilt to offer tourists a better idea of how they were originally.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of static image photography on the planet is 35 mm, which was the film size that most had in circulation at the end of the analog film era.
Currently it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its proportion was inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually confusingly 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The proportion of screen of this format (dividing by twelve to get the lowest ratio between integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same or are very close to that proportion.
The widely abused and often demoralized law of third parties is a fairly simple guideline that provides a dynamic at the same time that maintains a relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, went through scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
All were affected by their influence, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the money funds of the church are there specifically for that reason.
The central leadership of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the hostilities began, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, with the cutting of vital supplies of military and civilian, although this blockade has violated international regulations generally accepted and arranged in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, bringing danger even to neutral flagships.
Germany, since there was limited response to this tactic, expected an attack similar to its unrestricted underwater war.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States without a penny, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the head of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different times; every stage of China or every family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Moreover, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the time of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest ages in ancient China's history, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of Xi'an's great palace.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, vacancies were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since instead of patents based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed people from the working class of other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira '" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
the cave itself, which survived the times, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Resting at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find him, even if it's known that he exists, once inside the cave, it's a total isolation.
It is not possible to see anything but the clear blue sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the pyramids, tombs and smaller temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The mark of the "arc pointing upwards" has its appearance similar to a V, and the "mark of the bow pointing downwards" has its appearance similar to a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow; down means you should start at the bead (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general an arc upwards produces a smoother sound, while an arc downwards produces a stronger and assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that printed bow notes exist for a musical reason, so these should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, her two young children (Eleven-year-old Maria Teresa, and four-year-old Louis Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris, leaving Versailles, by a multitude of women from the markets.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and screaming threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester nodded with the head of a dead royal guard in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay a large part of the expenses and interest on securities with floating fees on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits originated from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of order.
The time when such events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, period of European history between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Low Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological Determinism is a term that encompasses a series of ideas in practice, the supply of technology or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and the manifestation of them in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share 2 general ideas: the first is that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" in societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of having a car.
The possession of mass cars leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health system to cure the injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, extracted from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, caused citizens to be molded and, over time, the customs and culture linked to this geography emerged, which, by being in harmony with the place of society, became better than the laws that might be mandatory.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the participants of the Crusade returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at that time that the title of Capital of the Fashion of Constantinople was transferred to Paris.
Gothic language reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can stay behind for 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances for the time was that, as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to close their garments.
The subsistence agriculture is the agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of farmers and their families.
Livestock farming is a simple, generally organic system that uses native stored seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals of a similar mentality who feel neglected by the standards of society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be different due to age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the limbs.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms and jargons.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to resort to the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, not socialized by adults while growing up.
These children are called "ferocious" or wild. Some of these children were confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was given to the rejection of the child by the parents because of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are angry may have suffered serious trauma or childhood abuse before being abandoned or having fled home.
It is supposed that others were raised by animals; they say that some lived on their own in the jungle.
When fully reared by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the private pet, such as their fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a help for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or face-to-face, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, as well as that little Microsoft Office talking clip.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software in order to question, alert and explain procedures that can be challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that does not nourish, care and educate, but this happens.
We see the Family Reception System as a safe zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has the duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education and guaranteed medical care.
Foster care is supposed to meet all the needs that were missing in the house from which they were taken.
The internet combines both interpersonal and mass communication elements.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "relationships with continuity" were also identified as new motivation characteristics by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Particularly, it is claimed that one person can detect whether another person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately evaluate sincerity.
He even suggests that such interpretation skills of human behavior can be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
20th-century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secret and manifest.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and the selection removes it from the expressed variation cluster.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as that of humans, consuming the available plant resources, meeting its amino acid requirements.
In addition, failing to act accordingly generates serious consequences: severe depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The resources of plant origin with greater accessibility would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us primates to digest, unless they are cooked.
However, animal foods (forms, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide proteins in large quantities that contain all essential amino acids.
Taking all this into account, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors had solved their "protein problems" more or less as the current savanna chimpanzees do.
Sleep interruption is a process that consists of deliberately waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep soon after (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a quiet alarm clock to bring it to consciousness without waking it for good.
If you see yourself redefining the clock while sleeping, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off
Other possibilities based on biorhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, as it forces a person to stand up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace correlates in an opposite way to his level of body and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the vital force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but they were expanded by Mahayana's path of love and many Indian Yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of comprehensive love.
With Yoga Kundalini, the kundalini energy (lighting energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and views.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are clean, the chakras are activated and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, system shocks, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years and, in fact, there would be leadership of replacement troops on the battlefields of Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Assault Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means to move large-scale people and goods across the oceans.
Navy work has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move people and goods while at the same time interfering with the ability of its enemies to move their own people and property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the battle of the North Atlantic of World War II. Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At that very moment, the German Navy organization, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have the ability to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems the goats had their domestication for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to maintain them in order to facilitate access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
The domestic goats were usually kept in herds that walked in the hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the best known shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
The Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden boards, this allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads on the slightly more rugged roads.
Dorms were implemented right at the beginning to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a metal cover on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was the walk. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning " erect man").
His predecessor, the Australopieco, did not walk upright as usual.
The adaptations of bipedality are found in the fossils of Australopithecus that date between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago. However, the Sahelanthropus may have stood, with both legs, long before, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want to have only a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems and end them.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have become greater because of man’s overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After the adoption by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to a few blocks away for a John Dunlap printery.
During the night they were made around 150 to 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap Attacks".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap attacks that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handmade copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs have survived and are alive to this day.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers currently used are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
Inner poisoning may not be apparent immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The greatest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic chemicals for domestic use.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to treat this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects structured enough to be attached to humans.
Both barbers and bedbugs are nesting, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disease in young people and adults
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
The research showed that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their interest, or that of their child.
Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, biological parents rescind their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It is not, in fact, just experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one of the possible hypotheses or more, to ask questions. To make observations also guides a scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greek receded, the West was far from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Several rhythms observed in physiology and behavior usually depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are absolutely not responses to external periodic stimuli, were found for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a continuous cycle period, even without interference from the environment.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that marked either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting areas of nature in order to enjoy the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking pictures, seeing birds, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, by car, people leave small towns in the countryside, to work in other cities, and meet other people who work just in these small towns where they came from.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a private car-based transport system.
Science today points out that this carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere of the stable state that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone also complains about these transport systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge falls are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make among themselves.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the driver’s behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
Such relationships help in the planning, design and operations of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to go into the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape more easily from enemies and to find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot bend their wings back are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said the Solar System was moving around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed otherwise; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because planet Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes almost 10 km wide.
A total of 20% of the water from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River has 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, who were so far over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City has about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its official laws and communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican city are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because all can be discovered in nature in the natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more four elements, which are earth, water, air and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
It is considered that elements such as calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You also get alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the universe are made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so astoundingly small that it would be possible for trillions of them to fit at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a paper and less important use.
Currently, people write messages through computer screens and do not need to get close to a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new comes up.
The fission pump works based on the principle that energy is needed to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like walking a heavy cart up a hill. The core division again releases, then, some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is composed of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker below the mountains.
There may be more maria on the nearest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what there are in certain people who make them want what they do and what things in their environment will make them do certain things or not.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy Theory of Needs and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general terms, two conducts can emerge as managers begin to lead their former coworkers. A side of the spectrum tries to stay as "part of the group of guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, adopting disciplinary measures, performing performance assessments, delegating and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an individual impossible to recognize who feels that he must change everything that the team has done and do his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often ends in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence of teams considered conventional, however, there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members generally act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may find themselves in different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a single component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team for whom each member should report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing an organizational learning? One of the practical objectives of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity appear.
As a result, the process of an organization that works as a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's need.
Even before an organization is innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels in their performances.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the research area and make it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain and behavioral pathology supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This gives us a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer the questions and diagnoses of clients, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and speech.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real - life problems.
The AI system is often used in the areas of economy, medicine, engineering and military, as it is integrated into various software applications of home computers and video games.
Study visits are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field lessons. From the classroom, students can see museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful artwork.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a walk and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennet School, North Carolina, develop a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the site is remodeled, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a souvenir book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Since students often start contacting blogs using bad grammar and spelling, then the presence of an audience usually changes that.
As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable in the world around them." The need to feed the public interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing on blogs is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students, so that they extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; interacting with Internet content actively, students can position themselves in the context of others' writings, as well as defining their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada and has a number of art galleries and museums that demonstrate the Canadian past and present.
Niagara Falls are further south; the north already has the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
Due to all this and much more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also rather unpopular and some are practically uninhabited in nature.
For comparison of the population that surprises many people: there are more African-Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The eastern islands of Africa are in the Indian Ocean, a distance from the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent by itself, when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach hotels.
The Arabs also took Islam to the lands, which gained much popularity in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape of Europe Route to India.
In the north, the region is limited by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all travelers say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (only not one that seems too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can cause acts they would consider as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men. Do not be afraid to stand firm (whether by cultural differences or not, that does not mean that everything is okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C., and was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenidas as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, who was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Near the historical part of Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a lot more trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the eastern tip of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, mainly the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of battle that persists in the province of Nord-Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of Africa's cheapest gorilla mountain trails.
You can use a boda-boda (mototaxi) to stroll through Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a quick ride.
"Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands, in view of its relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of heritages of humanity in threat, due to the danger of desert sands.
It was one of the main charts during Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World broadcast on the PBS channel.
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country because it has a touch more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the Mozambique border to the east, from Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the standard of South African National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entry and conservation of the park, as well as all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very useful to purchase a Wild Card. With it you can have access to several parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the site that many tourists consider to be their main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form the horizon of Hong Kong has already been compared to a chart of sparkling bars that is visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, get off the island and head to the edge of Kowloon on the opposite side.
Most of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is heavily concentrated on land recovered along the north coast.
This is the place the British settlers chose to live, and so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest band of mangroves in the world, extending for 80 km (50 mi) towards the interior of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park
But forests don't only have mangrove swamps - they have some of the last great jungles that have already covered the remaining gangic surface.
The Sundarbans cover an extension of 3,850 km2 and a third of it is covered by water/pantan areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer spotted in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) during the day, but most, especially those that go east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
As interdistrict buses are almost always crowded, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and resistant.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge of the Oiapoque River is a nested bridge. It crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, in Brazil, and São Jorge do Oiapoque, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and two slopes of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open for transit until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to go into operation in September 2017, the scheduled date for completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as seminomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The region of Chaco was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived on hunting, collecting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", arose from the meeting of the Spanish conquerors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in the permanence of many of its characteristics and identity of indigenous populations.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To learn about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Argentina Polo Association.
The official currency of Falklands is the pound of the Falklands (FKP), whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands that is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are accepted.
In remote islands, it is unlikely that credit cards will be accepted, although British and American coins may be received. Please inform the owners in advance to find out what payment method they accept.
It is practically impossible to change the Malvinas currency outside the islands, so change the money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is to the south of the equator, there is summer, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures are rarely below freezing, but combined wind and humidity make the sensation colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same during the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the instructions of the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters from the bears and wolves, and at 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, elk and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they haven't kept an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so don't come any closer.
Also, know that odors attract bears and other wild animals, however, avoid carrying or cooking foods with a strong smell and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a known naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Almost 200 lives of Germans and Americans perished.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamase Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being between two coves. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of the north coast (in North Harbour district) are bathed in the Pacific Ocean and range from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shadows from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the sophisticated suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops around the coast. Swimming is quite safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not an elaborate beer, but it is pleasurable and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines can come down better.
The local piped water is totally safe for consumption, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are afraid.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is "presso", the cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is in accordance with Belgian standards. The natural juices are expensive, but great.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes that occur on the reef are rare.
Keep heeding the authorities’ reminders, obeying all the signs and paying close attention to security alerts.
The cubemedusa occurs near beaches and river estuaries, from October to April, to the north of 1770. They can occasionally be found in other periods.
Sharks really do exist, but they rarely attack humans, most people are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean. Their main habitat is estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when arriving at his destination.
Travel agents usually do business with specific hotels, however likely it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping parks, by a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation from and to the airport, or even packages combined with flights and hotels.
They can also secure your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have any change or request, it should be forwarded first to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of participants at music festivals decide to camp on site, and most of them consider this a fundamental part of the experience.
If you want to stay close to the action, you'll have to get there early to be able to camp near the music.
Remember that even after the music is closed on the main stages, some sections of the festival may continue playing late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, check out the location of the cabin, as when crossing the ice a terrible noise is generated for the most sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. In general there are no windows or watches, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in good mood and to keep them on site.
Some locals offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, drunkenness harms judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of maintaining sobriety.
Whenever a person is driving in places with high latitudes or on roads over the mountains, he should take into account the possibility of facing snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low, and you can't drive like you're on clean asphalt.
During the snowfalls, it is possible to drop enough snow to keep you trapped in very little time.
Visibility may also get smaller due to falling or winding snow, or condensation or ice in the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost unbroken throughout the year.
The safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and eye girl of many visitors.
The term "safari", in its colloquial use, refers to trips by land to observe the impressive African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and basic equipment enables a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
Also known as "walking in the woods", "walking safari" or "passed", a safari on foot equals walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having been the home of the games in 1964.
If you have scheduled your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March most cancellation policies because of the coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets to the events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with normal tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
Wet ironing can help dry. Many hotels have iron and ironing board for loan, even if there is not one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to let the tissue get too hot (which can make it shrink or, in more severe cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more efficient against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough; in others, many minutes are needed.
The quality of filters varies and, if you are in doubt, it may be good to consider the possibility of buying gallons of water from a trusted company.
Travelers can find animal pests with which they have no familiarity in the regions where they came from.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people through force, usually do not qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the chance to buy tax-free goods and fees at certain locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially in products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often pass through isolated hinterland areas.
If you don't have the custom of driving on inland roads, have some sense: steep slopes, narrow slopes and sharp curves are common.
The announced speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - commonly 55-65 km/h - and strict obedience to them is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than over many other stretches of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good and, in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of the neighbor of the south, Austria.
Sweets with fruit are recurrent, with apples roasted in sweets all year round, and cherries and plums marking presence during the summer.
Many goods from German bakeries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other chestnuts. Famous cakes usually combine very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, may be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dried" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a range that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food originally is from the central and eastern parts of the main Java island.
Now widely available by the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simple-tempered dishes, the predominant condiments preferably Javanese being peanuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
For a knight's feet to have support, stirrups are used, which are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the knight, but they may present security problems, as the rider's feet may be caught in them.
If a knight is thrown from a horse, but had one of his feet grabbed in the stirrup, he can be dragged in case the animal ends up running away. To reduce this danger, various safety precautions can be taken
First, a large part of the pilots wear riding boots with heel and smooth sole, which is quite narrow.
Then some saddles, mainly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle pulled back by a falling rider.
Being Chile's main climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large walls and granite cliffs.
Meetings include exciting peak views. Mountaineers from all over the world are continually establishing new routes among their infinite wall potential.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding through snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important activity on the trip for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski booms", who plan a whole vacation just to ski in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old—Rupestrian paintings depicting skiers, dating back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport refers to the 17th century at the very least, and in the year 1861, the first recreational ski team was opened by Norwegian citizens in Australia.
Ski backpack: activity also known as hinterland skiing, skiing or skiing.
It is related, but usually does not involve mountain skiing or mountaineering tourism, the last done in steep terrain and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a hiking route.
In good condition, you will be able to cover distances a little longer than on foot — but only very rarely will you get cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on prepared slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, acts as a country in this respect.
If you stay in this area, you can cross the border without going through passport control posts again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define that items over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than mass-produced similar products.
The creation of reindeer is an important means of subsistence among the Sami, and culture around trade is also important for many other classes of professionals.
Although it is a tradition, not all Sami participated in the creation of large-scale reindeer, but they lived on fishing, hunting and such, with reindeer as, mainly, traction animals.
Today, many Sámi work with modern business. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romanis, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.

Bad weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disturbances or loss of human lives.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and encompasses different types, which vary according to geographical location, topography and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of a harsh climate, as well as storms, tornadoes, water trunks and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal climate phenomena include snowstorms, snowstorms, icestorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be alert to any risk of bad weather in their region, as this may affect travel plans.
When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, one must first receive professional training.
An Internet search for 'Host Environment Course' will usually indicate the address of a company in the region.
A course will normally cover all topics discussed here with much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves dramatization, various first aid and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with jungle survival are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Travelers planning a sex change surgery abroad should ensure that they are carrying valid documents for the return trip.
Governments' willingness to issue undefined gender (X) passports, or updated documents to find a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is widely variable.
The searches at the security checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transsexuals who have not yet performed gender-exchange surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Return currents are the reflux of the water from the waves on the beach returning to the sea, usually on a reef or similar area.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and you can form a rapid stream to deep water there.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue by trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the stream, swimming back is no more difficult than it would normally be.
Try targeting somewhere where you can't be caught or, depending on your abilities or if you've been detected, wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs before cultural shock (less honeymoon time) lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have a special difficulty in readjusting to their native culture.
On returning home after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People do not imagine that patience and understanding are also fundamental for travelers who are coming home.
In the area reserved for children, one of the most interesting things is the show of lights and sounds of the pyramid.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is defined as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed in the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which had their discovery in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active until 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the village of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The rest are Livingston Island and Deception, in which the flooded boiler of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, coastal to the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge on the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth mountains, cut by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892 meters on Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors with satellite view.
The service is often used for transportation, including recreational craft, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone operator may offer more information about the connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who intend to have a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those leaving school, allowing them to take a year before university, without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a sabbatical year can, in fact, increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Normally, there will be a registration fee to enroll in these educational programs.
For those who like boating, Finland is a great destination. In the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the "Land of the Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are really large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing with a boat is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is combined by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but a very characteristic form (e.g. in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for two whole days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you embark only on sea excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, in the flyers. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if these people have not traveled by plane before or have never experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Conveyor companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important in sending commercial documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, depending on the route, it could take days to get to the landing and pass through customs.
The only way to get through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines regulations do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you enter.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is by disbursing a large amount of money for privilege (or, better yet, by making your company do this for you).
However, it is not cheap: as basic rules, you can expect to pay up to four times more in relation to the normal economic rate for the executive class and eleven times more for the first class!
In general terms, it is not even worth looking for discounts on executive class seats or first class on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge according to this.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the country is Romanian, but the Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations were reestablished between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million people, and has the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transport centre.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and agitated shopping center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass façade buildings and modern shopping centers are marked by traditional red roofs, the 18th century market, and the old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that refers more to Mediterranean Europe than to classical Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect he deserves, and don't make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the spot by staining or cracking the constructions with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half people prefer to speak Catalan, much understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish
However, most of the plates are only in Catalan, because this is the language that was established by law as an official language.

Regular subway announcements are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self - centered, rude and arrogant.

The sudden exterior of the Parisians will quickly disappear, if you show some basic courtesy
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is highly wooded, mainly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.

Rare animals can be found there, such as European grizzly bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and tetraches, as well as several other common species
While visiting the monasteries, women are forced to wear skirts covering their knees and also need to have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide costumes for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own costumes, especially with bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers covering their knees.
It is possible to borrow clothes from the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, there is a unique size!

A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any ingredient available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word Sie for you, always start with capital letters, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This also makes reading easier, no doubt, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used substantively.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they were written.
The main letters to be observed are C and G, because their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: expensive means dear, while car means automobile.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mainly regular grammar.
So reading this grammar booklet will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
Needless to say, if you have knowledge of a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a bit of Spanish may precipitously conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to the point that it is not necessary to study separately.
Pre-modern observatories are most often outdated today and remain in museums or schools.
As light pollution in their golden age was not a problem, they usually find themselves in cities or campuses of universities, easier to arrive than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas that have favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where the blossoms of the plum tree were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first feasts of the cherry blossoms were held by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants have a better appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" mute.
If you visit a garden arranged in a formal way, collecting "species" will also cause you to be expelled, without the right to discussion.
Singapore is usually an extremely safe and very easy place to explore, and you can buy almost everything after you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of Ecuador, you will need to deal with heat (constant) as to the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).

There's a tradition of spending Easter night awake somewhere open to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches usually hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend. Congregations often break the celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ’s resurrection.
All the animals that originally reached the islands came here swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the aurora borealis, because the sky gets dark at about the right time.
As the areas are poorly inhabited, and consequently light pollution is not a problem, you can also appreciate the stars.
In Japan, labor cultural relations are more based on hierarchy and formality than Westerners are accustomed to see.
Suits are the standard suit in business, and coworkers call each other for their last names or positions.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than exalting individual achievements.
