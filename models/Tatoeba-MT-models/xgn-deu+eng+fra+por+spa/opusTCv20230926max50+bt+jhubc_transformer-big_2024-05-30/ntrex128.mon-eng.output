I'm concerned about the fact that the National Assembly of the Republic of Moldova seems to be in the minority.
Some members of the National Assembly are not in a single position to change their name (as members of the National Assembly) and some oppose it.
That's because the name of the forum is changed to the name of the forum.
The National Assembly of the People's Republic of China is concerned that this change will make them stupid.
A member of the National Labour Party said he was concerned that a group of people could hear a poem that sounded like a head, a, a, a, and b.
For those who don't live in poverty, it's a sign that B is a human being.
In his speech at the conference, Papua New Guinea said that he was "no" and that he had a different way of saying "no."
The U.S. conservatist said that the change in the name of the group was "unreasonable," but due to a slight change in the name of the group, the UN General Assembly decided to make a move to become a fool and naive member of the National Assembly.
In this sense, the letter "V" is similar to the English pronunciation of the letter "Y" in the English language.
According to the House of Representatives, the Committee on the Reformation of the Change Act said: "The members of the Assembly will make their final decision on the final decision."
In 2017, the United Nations General Assembly granted the right to change its name.
In June, the Board of Directors introduced a proposal to change the name of the House of Representatives.
As the National Assembly calls for more support from members of the House of Representatives of the Council of the United States, the National Assembly has received more support than the National Assembly.
Members of the Assembly offer different options, but in just a few weeks, President Elon Johns has become a victim of a head injury to the idea that this change will be extended to a single solution.
A number of changes related to the changes in the law will be made to the Assembly's resolution, including changes to the reorganization of members of the Assembly, as well as changes to the structure of the Committee.
After a long debate on the law, the members of the Assembly will decide what changes will be made.
The Macedonians have agreed to change the name of the country
Members of the public will vote on whether to change the name of the country in the "Department of the Republic of Macedonia."
This proposal is aimed at resolving the issue of the dispute that has been going on for decades with Greece's neighbour Greece, the name of Macedonia, in the name of Macedonia.
From Athens to Athens, the name of its northern neighbor has long been criticized for being the name of the Greek state, and has repeatedly refused to join the European Union, NATO and NATO.
President George Ivanov, President of Macedonia Ivanov, said in a statement that he would not change his name.
However, the Prime Minister said that, as a general vote, the proposal to change its name would be a simple step to join the European Union and NATO.
The Church of the Lord of the Rings was in the midst of the controversy, and the Church of St. Martin
"The people I talked to at the time of the war were the people I met, and there was a bar and a temple in every corner of the city," said Mr. Adams.
"But both of them are gone today."
He said, "It's obvious why the people didn't."
He said: "People are making a difference in a variety of ways."
"It's clear that there's a lot of people in the neighborhood who can't afford to live long."
However, the Church said it would not be possible for the church to return to a long-term recovery as it had been planned for the church leaders, and sooner or later they would return to that point.
He added that the temples were built by people who could not help in the nearby temples.
The majority of the people who buy these houses are white people, and the majority of these white people are white because they were not allowed to join these temples and to go to church.
A few decades before black people came to the city of black people, the Saint Martin built two churches in 1870.
In 1930, the local church of the White Rabbit, the Methodist Church, moved to the Middle East.
The black people who worked with him were in this house.
The main shopping street in Harlem and the 125th street in the street supported the leader of the retailers and the black black black people, and built a meeting with the protestant John Howard Johnson under the leadership of St. Martin.
In 1939, the fire was destroyed by fires, but the father Johnson made plans to rebuild the temple and to use the kaillon music.
The father of Johnson's son, the successor of his son, Raymond David Johnson, has lost his voice to the music of the poor.
A professional who played Carlton in July said it differently: "The value of the property and precious metals, in any case, the inexpensive cultural instrument."
Tiffany N., a professional at the University of Michigan, said that this was the first black musician to play a classical carnival that moved to Riddlesburg 18 years ago.
Mr. Harrison said, "Martin did not change his mind."
Things that have been happening in St. Martin over the past few months have been difficult for architects and contractors. Some of these are leaders of the church, some of whom came from the Episcopal Hampshire.
In July, the governing body of Church leaders asked whether or not they would donate certain things to the Church. But the Church did not hire architects and contractors to participate.
Some Christians have complained that the lack of transparency in the contents of the contents is a bad thing.

On September 30, 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Sputnik Zarevich, and his wife, Zordan, and his son Du<0xC5><0xA1>eko, announced the name of the Macedonian country to return to NATO and to join the European Union.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kramerrkov gathered a small table behind the scenes of the protests against opponents.
"We're going to have to go to Nato and the EU, but we don't want to go to the door because we don't want to be part of it."
"We are poor people, but we have a name.
If they don't want us to wait for Macedonia, we can become a part of Eurasia integration."
The Prime Minister said NATO's membership will bring in the necessary investments in the country where more than 20 percent of its private workforce is in need of a job.
"More than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO, and I think we're going to have a lot of support," he said.
He said the "yes" would be "the future of our lives."

"We'll see what we've accomplished in the first half of this year."
There are five weeks left for the most important election in our lives.
"It's one of the big and big things - I'm not quite sure, but really, I'm just trying to figure out why I'm fighting for good candidates all the time."
Trump continued, "You're seeing a radical radical group of Democrats and Democrats, that's what's happening right now.
They have decided to return power in any way, and you can see it's incompetence and corruption.
It doesn't matter who they are, who they hurt, who they are, who they are, and who they want, and if they want authority and control, we won't give them."
According to him, the Democratic Party wants to "make it happen" and "successful."
"You've seen it for the last four days," he said, "and you've been saying it's illegal, unfair, and unfair."
He was a member of the Senate Justice Committee, and opposed to the name of the Democratic Party Fitzgerald Fitzgerald.

Did you write the documents?
Oh, my God, it's all right.
No, no, no, no, I wait for one thing – it was a really bad language, and it was the worst language I've ever seen."
It's no longer a full-time job.
This is not to say that people don't listen to their own ideas.
I'm not surprised that the local media outlets in my area were surprised to find me.
After all, I've finally come to the conclusion that I don't have any support from those who are working in the office.
I'm in a similar situation with John Ryan, who was in the same position as I was in the House of Representatives.
In my case, I've been criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the important economic policy issue, about national security, about Europe, and, strangely, the same issues that Jeremy's predecessors did not agree with.
In a statement released on Friday's last meeting of the Labour Party, he said: "We want to have a broad and effective meeting.
For the past eight years, I have been a member of the House of Representatives, where most of my family members have been members of the House of Representatives.
Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a great deal of conflicts in today's society, and if there is no such thing as a "politician" or a political promise, it will be forgotten.
The difference is that it's more likely to work in the workplace, and it's up to each of the leaders of the party to determine if they're going to get the job done.
All this began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and as I thought of political views, my colleagues who had previously made me think of me as a national security or the EU's official office.
Every time I speak in public, whether I say what I say or not, I'm being bullied on social media, and I'm angry that I'm not supposed to be working in the workplace.
It's not just that I felt it.
In fact, I know that I'm more interested in politics than I do with my work.
I'm faced with a lot of racism and racism every day, but I'm amazed at the ability and determination of my fellow professionals who don't work.
One of the most important things in today's political climate is that it seems to be a bad thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that it was necessary to develop a culture of work.
The reality is that we are no longer in a broad range, and we are becoming more and more of a "faithful" movement or a change of direction.
For the past two years, I've had a lot of fun with the idea that "I'm going to be fine."
I didn't go into politics to do this.
Thirty years ago, when I was a student, when I was a student of the Patriot Government, nearly collapsed my class, I joined the Labour Party and I tried to provide the best service to anyone in the local government, government advisors, or government service.
I've never had a problem with it, and I've never been in the last election.
No one in the world understands what I'm talking about and what I'm dealing with in my current political situation.
I don't understand why I don't want to sell my work and energy to people who support this movement on Friday.
But, in fact, my only non-significant statement is not intended to be a Labour Party member, regardless of whether I'm proud of my elected representatives: I'm proud to serve you and I'm proud to announce the election results and many political objectives that you can't stop working for me.

John Edwards: The importance of language in the world
The results of the Scottish independent schools' academic success in 2018 have been confirmed by the increasing success of sports singles, arts, music, and other social work.
The Scottish independent school board (SCIS) is working with more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland to provide their students and parents with the best central services.
The students are expected to attend the next stage of their careers, their chosen careers, and their world-class position.
As an educational institution that allows us to develop a personalized curriculum, we believe that today's language classes are a good choice.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak in a language that you understand, it will go to your head.
If you speak to him in the mother tongue, he will come to his heart."
If we want to build relationships with other countries and trust them, it's a powerful statement that we don't have to rely on English only.
This year's survey results show that we can focus on the highest-ranking Liga table for independent language schools.
In fact, 86% of students who are studying foreign languages have received a high rating of A.
According to the SCIS, 74% of the students who received the scholarship from the University of Manila received a higher rating from the Mandarin language, 72 percent of the students studying German, and 69 percent of the students who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied in Spanish received a A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland have a very important skill for young children and support them in the future.
Language courses are now chosen in the context of STEM courses (Technology, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A 2014 study conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Employment Commission found that 17% of employers find it difficult to find employment for employers.
Therefore, it is more important for young people to prepare for their future careers.
In addition to the skills required for a more promising future, these skills are important all over the world.
Depending on what type of career you choose, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future.
Many of the people who speak foreign languages will be directly involved in the competition.
In 2013, according to a survey conducted by YouGov, more than 4,000 adults in England were unable to speak a foreign language, 75 percent of those who speak only French had two percent.
That's why it's important to invest in today's children's education.
Learning a foreign language, especially in developing countries, will increase the opportunity for children to work in a meaningful way.
There will be a difference in the language used in schools.
If you focus on the classical language in the modern school, others will teach Mandarin or Japanese to be the most important in the future until 2020.
Your child will be able to choose from a wide range of language courses that can be taught in an independent school.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create a learning environment that will provide them with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
In today's business environment, language in the business world is unfamiliar with the fact that it plays an important role in the future of the country, and it must also be incorporated into education.
In fact, it's really important to understand that today's languages are "politically correct."
The schools will continue to offer this option to young people in Scotland, who have a lot of diversity, diversity and reputation.
We have to do that.
John Edwards is the head of the Scottish Public Schools Board.

"But we haven't received any response from the United States."
" Without trust in the United States, our national security is not guaranteed, and in such circumstances, we cannot become a nuclear-weapon country."
The North Korean government said it would accept North Korea's sanctions on North Korea's non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and be rewarded for the actions that North Korea has taken to order.
North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump signed a joint joint statement on June 12 at a meeting held in Singapore on June 12 on the basis of the "North Korea" promise to establish a North Korea without nuclear weapons, while Kim Jong-un promised to guarantee North Korea's security.

This year, Pompo has been visited three times in North Korea and has not been a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, and he said the progress had been made, but soon he accused North Korea of being "extraordinary."
North Korea has agreed to take a U.S. deal with it this month, saying that if the U.S. agrees with the agreement, the missile will destroy the space and nuclear complex.
According to him, Kim's "progressive measures" were guaranteeing the security of Trump's promise to Singapore, and that Washington will continue to maintain normal relations with Washington.

It's important to note that the European team's long-term goal is to make sure that it's not going to happen soon.
The European team leader Thomas Brighton Perry has said that he's a lot more stressful in the last few days than in the last few days.
Dane was the first player to play in Valerara in 1997 and scored 5 goals in the U.S., while Sebastian scored 141-1-131.
"We have repeatedly warned the Valdera and Bronx that we have lost our scores, and we have lost," Broadway said in a statement at the 2018 National Golf Club on Friday and the 10th of May.
I think the story is all about me and everyone else.
You're going to be like a slut tomorrow.
Do the things you need to do.
It doesn't mean that the game isn't over yet.
We have a goal to win, so we're very focused.
I'm going to focus on all 12 of my teammates, but don't forget that we are the best athletes on the planet."
He added that his athletes were happy to play on the hard golf field and added: "I've never imagined that.
Tomorrow is going to be another monster.
Tomorrow's game will be a bit different.
It's important to be good with your partner on the field, but it's important to know that golfers will be able to compete on their own personal games.
That's what I'm trying to do when I'm the best player on the team.
Now he has to do everything he can to help his teammates."
Compared to Birmingham, Jim Francis was more focused on his players than his singles, but on the other side, he was given three of the four, including Jordan Spencer and Justin Thomas.
Fredrik himself was at the end of these big turnovers, and he became one of the winners of the Bronx team in Brooklyn, not the loss of European teams.
In 1999, an elder, Bryan Knight, who was active on his last day, said, "I remember every word he said."
We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but you've got to get your hands on the game as you've seen in Brooklyn.
When you're in the middle of a game, the game is very stressful.
"We're building our team structure and schedule, and you know, we're going to try to make magic in tomorrow's game."
Thomas was appointed to lead or lead the high-ranking role, and while Roger McClure was on the first half of the match, the first half of the match was played with other European players such as Paul Kaylee, Justin Roosevelt, John Rangers, Tommy and Ian Porter.
In a single game, Bryan said, "I've been in this group of guys, because I thought I'd go the right way."
The New Order's Renewed
According to local media reports, the ships of cold-war ships were scheduled to be replaced by the German Navy's most recent shipment shipment in 2014, but were reportedly delayed until the end of the year due to defective system and tsunami funds.
In a press release titled "Roland-Palestinian" - a new class of bachelor-builders, a new naval vessel, which had been in operation for the first half of 2019, the Di Zeitian newspaper said.
The ship was supposed to be a navy ship in 2014, but the problems with the project were solved in the following way.
In 2007, the Marine Marine Fleet was ordered to replace four ships of Bremen-Wenberg.
They include a large number of missiles or a number of missiles, as well as some mysterious technologies such as radar reducer, ultraviolet radiation and acoustic aerospace.
It's been a long time since we've been using the same equipment for two years, so we're going to have to wait two months to get a new one.
However, it is important to note that the long-term plans for the construction of a new vessel have already been approved by the German government.
The F125 Shipyard was written in a number of newspapers a year ago and refused to accept the official shipment of the German navigator, and returned to Hammmet&Vos in Hamburg.
Once the ship is ready to return, the first flight will be the first.
One reason for the refund is that the news of Germany has a number of "programs and hardware defects" and it is not possible to use it on the battlefield.
The lack of software failure is especially important for the Marine Corps, with 120 marine vessels on the brink of war.
Also, because the ship is more heavy than the ship, it is impossible to reduce the speed indicators for the future.
7,000 tons of "Roland-Pop" are twice as heavy as the ships used in World War II.
In addition to the cost of the project, the cost of the project is also a problem.
The project is expected to increase to 3.1 euros ($3.6 billion).
The problem with the new ship's fleet is that it is becoming a major problem.
At the beginning of this year, the House of Representatives of the Council of Ministers of Germany, Han-Peter Bartlett Nielsen, said: "We have accepted that the shipment of ships is low.
Although the former ships were no longer used, the replacement was not a replacement, and the problem was that they were very much in control over the time period.
He regretted that none of the ship's ships would be able to integrate Nivea.

Other British car manufacturers, Honda, Bieber and Jaguar Larry Larry, are afraid to leave the European Union.

The problem is that there is no shortage of automotive manufacturers.
Toyota manufactures products according to the order "times" and, according to the order, the vehicle parts are supplied by the UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leave the EU on March 29, the European Union will leave without any agreement, and the production industry will fall short of its target.

We've seen a lot in the past few weeks that we've been trying to do as much as we can with the president of the United States. "

How the U.S.-China trade war has impacted
The beginning of the trade war between the United States and China has been atrocious, but the war has ended, and experts believe that the two countries have benefited in Beijing for a long time.
US President Donald Trump gave the first warnings earlier this year to China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase this week was the new tariffs, which amounted to $200 billion ($150 billion) in the submarine, which has been taxed on all goods sold by China.
Beijing received a similar response, and in the last half of the US$60 billion, the tariffs for goods rose from 5 to 10%.

Although Washington is expected to increase its presence in Washington, it is a shame that the public's eyes are on the public's eyes.
However, if Beijing plays the right match, the trade war with the United States will support China's economy for a long time and reduce the relationship between the two countries.
