Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are worried about the possibility of being "perceived as whims"
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their job title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The cause of this is plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament"(Welsh Parliament).
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
One of the Labour Party's AMs explained that their group is concerned about "the repercussions of the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "solitary" and "pwp" means "kaka".
The party Plaid AM indicated that none of the group was "not satisfied" and had suggested alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party admitted that their group was ready to consider the change of name, but added that the MWP is very similar to Muppet, which means "herd".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire dialect "u".
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently working on a draft law to change the name, informed: "The final decision on what terms will be used to designate the members of the Assembly must, of course, be made by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal, which obtained broad support for changing the Assembly’s name to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the name of AM, the panel preferred the "Welsh Parliament Member" (WMP), but the MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
It is clear that alternatives are being proposed, but the struggle for a deal could be a headache for Assembly speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to table a change bill in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes in the work of the assembly, including laws on the disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote of the AM on what they will be called will take place after the legislative acts have been discussed.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on name change
Voters will vote on Sunday whether their country will be renamed the "Republic of North Macedonia".
A referendum was held to settle decades of disputes with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour gives the impression of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's request for admission to the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, one of the opponents of the plebiscite for changing the name, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply something that needs to be done in order to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin’s Church are silenced as the churches of Haarlem fight for existence.
“As the old people I’ve talked to say, there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams says.
"Now there is neither one nor the other."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms that people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the churches, he is worried that the money received from the sale of property will run out sooner than the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will have returned to the starting point."
The churches, he added, will probably be replaced by apartment buildings with apartment properties that will be occupied by people who will not help the remaining shrines in the area.
"Most of the people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and the day will come when these churches will be closed forever, because it is unlikely that most of the people who will enter these apartments will become members of these parishes."
Both churches were built by a white congregation before Haarlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left the building in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the black congregation, which had worshiped God right next door.
The Black Congregation of St. Martin's Church took over his blessings during the reign of John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of working retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Haarlem, who had refused to hire Blacks or give them a promotion.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but as the members of Father Johnson’s congregation planned to renovate the building, they ordered a bell game.
His blessing, David Johnson, son of his father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played this bell game in July used other words: "a treasure of culture" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, added that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather told us that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s Church reflected the knotted relationship between architects and construction contractors, some of which were attracted by secular power, and others by the episcopal diocese of the church.
The Council of the Congregation, which consists of secular leaders, addressed the diocese in writing in July with concern that the diocese would "try to pass on the costs" to the council, although the council was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some in the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese’s work.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Teen at Lobster Fishing Site
A shark on Saturday in California attacked a 13-year-old boy who dive after lobsters and wounded him. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services say.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near the beach of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had nipped for about half an hour on Saturday morning when they heard the boy calling for help and then rowed up to him with the group to help pull the boy out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he thought it was just a delight to catch a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!
I'm being bitten!"
It is important to note that this is not the case in the case of the United States, but in the case of the United States.
"I cried out to everyone to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was taken by air to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was declared critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles told the media in a briefing that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was found not to be dangerous to humans.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
Authorities closed beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons for the duration of the investigation.
According to Jail, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to enter UK beauty market
Sainsbury's goes on strike at Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty product rack rows and trained sellers.
As part of a major investment in the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow despite declining fashion and home furnishings sales, 11 stores in the country will be testing out larger shelves of beauty products, and if all goes well, there will be more next year.
In the beauty industry, money is invested when supermarkets look for opportunities to use shelves that were previously reserved for TVs, microwave ovens and home goods.
Sainsbury's announced it would double its beauty product offerings to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with branded areas similar to those in Boots stores, for example.
The supermarket also re-launches its "Boutique" line of make-up, where most of the products will be vegan-friendly - a demand that is increasingly being made by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume wholesaler Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to small food purchases every day in local stores means that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that outlets will become more and more like department stores as the chain struggles with discount stores Aldi and Lidl, offering a wider range of services, but without food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in several hundred stores and has opened several Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which is said to have improved sales and made the purchased product more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in a defeat.
Sainsbury's joint venture with Boots was tried out in the early 2000s, but the alliance broke up after a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from pharmacy merchandise to supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after Sainsbury's 3 years ago sold its 281 store-large pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
According to this plan, the task of "Lloyds" will be to supplement the assortment with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including "Roche-Posay"and "Vichy", in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "To improve the customer experience, we have redesigned the look and feel of our beauty product shelves.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment combined with a convenient location means that we are now a delightful destination on the road to beauty, a destination that challenges the shopping habits of the past."
Peter Jones "full of anger" after Holly Willow's withdrawal from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
“Dragon Den” star Peter Jones was “overtaken by anger” after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up an 11-million-pound deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby does not have time to devote to the brand "Truly" of their home outfits and accessories.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand "Goop".
This Morning’s 37-year-old host used Instagram to announce she was leaving.
Holly Willowby has left "Dragon Den" star Peter Jones boiled in anger as she left their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new colossal contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "full of anger" when a TV-gold girl during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said her new contracts, worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meant she had no more time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of Gvinetta Platrova and, according to hints, it will double the wealth of Viloubia, which is estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Willowby (37) used Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones took him away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source of information: "Truly was the most important of Holly's priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, to which the next decades would be devoted.
Her decision to leave surprised all involved unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the center of Marlow there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning CEO, one of the most financially profitable stars, could cost the company millions, as a lot of money has been invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home goods, and will further delay their launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willoubia, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Truly by Willoubia was set up with Kapp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The pair spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willowby is set to become the brand’s M&S ambassador, and she will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said yesterday: "We don't want to comment on his business!"
Serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from news companies for a comment that some may find “inappropriate for the president” and for his positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did the president give up so much?
Trump said in his voice as a “message editor.”
"I didn't give up anything!"
He said Kim had shown interest in meeting again after Trump recognized his initial meeting in Singapore in June as a big step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong-ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a US "response" to North Korea's initial steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he said, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his work to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: stopping missile tests, helping to release prisoners, and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach when it came to his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to make an impression of the president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this tightly populated area, we have 200 right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia kills hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations, for example, were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, the state of the national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, on many occasions, they made it very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so this is a known problem," Ms Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children collects a group to travel to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the regular occurrence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unprepared for natural anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been set up in Aceh, they are rare along other coasts.
The lack of warning sirens for the tsunami in Palu, despite the warning being effective, likely also contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the most favorable times, moving between Indonesia's many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-hospital, which had anchored in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is now heading to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new devastation.
President Joko Widodo had made the improvement of Indonesia’s devastated infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign, and he has given large sums to roads and railways.
However, Mr Djoko's administration has been tormented by a lack of funds, and he is expected to be re-elected next year.
Furthermore, Mr Djoko has to contend with the long-standing problem of tensions between sects in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have, but also how much you spend.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
He scored a goal from Xherdan Shaqiri, about 25 meters (30 yards) from the Chelsea goal, when his team lost 1:0.
He moved the ball slightly to the left of himself and then kicked the ball towards the farthest goalpost.
In this attempt, the ball flew high over the field, reaching the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over the head of the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get the position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I just tried to get myself as much time as possible," he told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, touching the ball, and, without thinking much, kicked."
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation.
The Blues returned the ball to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>ic before turning to the middle of the field and jumping into the side of Liverpool as fast as possible.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly passed and got the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice kick between the players, allowing Azard to get into the zone.
Azard beat the defense at speed and finished the combination, hitting the farthest pole in the net with his left foot, passing Liverpool by Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea and Videoton will meet in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll reaches 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet (<0x7E>6.0 m) high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
The town of Pala, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered in debris from collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Woman Assassinated
An investigation into the murder was launched this morning after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead to contact us and see or hear anything suspicious.
I also encourage anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car camcorders, to contact us, as they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokeswoman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a native of Birkenhead and was found on her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, according to the police, they are engaged in informing the closest relatives of the victim.
The driver of the taxi, who lives in Greystone City, tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He could not say a word when he found out what had happened.
Citizens are informed that it will take hours for them to be allowed to return.
It was heard that a policeman told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime appeared a woman in tears.
She continues to repeat, "It's so awful!".
At two o’clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another one was placed right next to the outside.
Several policemen were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment building.
All who have information by September 30 are asked to use DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 naming 247.
Cromwell’s statue in parliament becomes the latest scandal of “rewriting history”
The renunciation would be ethically justified in view of the Taliban-like activities that led to the destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious monuments by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace would also become a target.
Cromwell himself neither ordered nor carried out the destruction of the icons during the English Civil War.
It is possible that the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, who lived centuries before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s glorious portrayal of Cromwell in the 19th century is part of historiography of a person who many believe is still worthy of veneration.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was seen by many - probably more at the end of the 19th century than today - as a defender of parliament against external pressure, which in his case was, of course, a monarchy.
Historical discussions continue on whether this is really a perfectly accurate depiction of the topic.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable personality representing one of the sides of the division of that time.
His accomplishments as Lord tread are worthy of praise and mention."
Pig-Murderer to Death Ruined Farmer in China
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed in a pig market in southwest China.
The man -- only his surname Yuan -- was found dead with a broken artery, all in one blood at a pighouse in the market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer is about to inject the vaccines into pigs on 30 May 2005 in the pig barn in Xining Province of Qinghai in China.
He and his cousin were reported to have come from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the man dead and discovered that the door of the adjacent pighouse was standing open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the pighouse with blood on his mouth.
According to the information, the forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound (<0x7E>249 kg) whore had torn the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin -- only his surname Wu is mentioned, according to "Guiyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how Yuan enters the market on Thursday at around 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager informed Evening News that the weeper was turned on to prevent it from attacking others while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to information, Yuan's family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, it is known about other attacks of pigs on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a man’s critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound (<0x7E>295 kg) pig in Wales kept a farmer pressed against a tractor until the animal was frightened by his wife.
After farmers ate his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs were generally not aggressive, but the taste of the blood could act as a “gun shot.”
"They're just playful.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The conclusion of Orcan Rose brings a wide and powerful rain in the southwest of the United States
The hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it crosses the coldest waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding torrential rains in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
At five o'clock in the afternoon (North American Eastern Time), the Rose wind gusts reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour), corresponding to a Category 1 hurricane, and its point was 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure depression is formed that moves eastward to the east coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula with the force of a tropical storm, on Monday it will begin to push moisture masses deep from the tropical belt to the north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches (<0x7E>25.4 cm) of rain on Monday in part of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching low-pressure depression, will create a large area of heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
1–4 inches (<0x7E>2.6–10.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, mud currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
The humidity deep out of the tropical belt will cause torrential rains that will reach 2-3 inches (<0x7E>5.1-7.6 cm) per hour in some places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, especially in most parts of Arizona, up to 24 inches (<0x7E>5.2–10.1 cm) of rain is expected.
Sudden floods with rapid deterioration due to the dispersion of tropical rainfall are possible.
It is very undesirable to go to the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but thunderstorms will bring local gusty winds and sandstorms.
The low-pressure depression will bring strong local rain on part of the South California coastline as it approaches.
Rainfall of more than half an inch (<0x7E>1.3 cm) is possible and can result in small mud flows and slippery roads.
This will be the region's first rainfall in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains take over a larger area late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rain on Tuesday will spread in the Four Corners region (DR Colorado, DA Utah, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and will last all Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as temperatures in the Arctic drop, but the tropics are still relatively warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in temperature over a short distance.
This is an example of a dramatic temperature difference on Sunday in the central United States.
The difference between the temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Des Moines, Iowa, varies by almost 20 degrees.
In the following days, the long-lasting summer heat will try to form and expand.
In most parts of the United States, the beginning of October is expected to be warm, with temperatures reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit (<0x7E>27 degrees Celsius) or more in large areas from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (<0x7E>27 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability that temperatures in the eastern United States will exceed average in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the hearing on Brett Caveno’s case
More than 20 million people watched six TV channels on Thursday with excitement, according to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Caveno of sexual harassment that she claimed took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political tie continued, with broadcasters interrupting their regular broadcasts to report on Friday's latest turnaround: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's agreement that the FBI will investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Caveno had been harassed by her drunkenness and tried to take off his clothes during a high school party.
Caveno lustlessly testified that he was absolutely convinced that this did not happen.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded average viewership.
Data from other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network, who demonstrated it, were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually has problems counting the number of people watching what's going on in the offices.
To get a better picture, this viewership corresponds to the number of viewers in the playoffs or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators have resolutely supported the appointment of Caveno, had the highest number of spectators, an average of 5.69 million during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS raised 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican team published a statement that he would vote for the appointment of Caveno, the senator noticed the cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning as he, accompanied by protesters' outcry, tried to reach the Justice Committee's hearing by elevator.
On CNN, he stood for several minutes with pierced eyes, like bearded.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed he was informed that he still had something to say at the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters followed live hours later when the Committee on Legal Affairs was preparing to vote on the nomination of Caveno for the vote in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would look into the charges against the candidate next week, which had been demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his Democratic friend Senator Chris Coons.
After talking with Koons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
The choice of Flake was important because it was clear that Republicans would not have votes to approve Caveno without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of political games over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused people criticising her plan to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, right next to an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, May’s former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continues to attack her Brexit plan for Britain’s future relationship with the European Union, the so-called (Chequers plan), stressing that the suggestion that Britain and the EU use each other’s tariffs is “absolutely absurd”.
It’s also important to keep in mind that there is a lot of work to be done.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police station said.
Officials released a video showing Sims colliding with Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The CBS subsidiary WAFB reports that police found glasses at the scene of the crime and found Simpson’s blood on them.
After Simpson was interrogated, the police informed him that he had confessed to Wade's shooting.
According to the lawyer, he was given a bail of <0x24>350,000.
A team of forensic experts from the East Baton Rouge Parish Parish on Friday issued a provisional finding that the death was caused by a shot in the head that hit the neck.
The Department thanked the Louisiana State Police’s Refugee Search Operations Team, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the territorial lawmakers for their "effort and work in the name of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-inch (<0x7E>1.98 m) long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
If you’re looking for a new job, then you’re looking for a new job.
"That's what people always worry about," Wade said.
A volcano spits ash across Mexico City
The ash that rises from the Pocatépetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhood of the Mexican capital.
After activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours were recorded, the National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The center observed multiple quivering and trembling.
Pictures in social networks showed that the windshields of cars in the vicinity of Mexico City, for example, in Xochimilco, are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have noticed an activation of the 45-mile (72-km) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with public order police and when thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote for secession.
A group of disguised supporters of secession, who were hindered by the public order police, tossed them with eggs and shed powdery paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which would normally be full of tourists.
Later that day, the police continued to use batons to prevent fights.
Several hours of pro-independence groups, chanting: "Don't forget and don't forgive!", were involved in a confrontation with pro-unity protesters who chanted: "For a long life for Spain!"
According to local newspapers, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
One year after the referendum in Madrid, which was declared illegal but was praised by the Catalans, tensions remain high in the independence region.
Voters strongly argued for independence, although voter turnout was low and those opposed to secession boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to Catalan officials, almost 1 000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, and violent clashes broke out.
The pro-independence groups were on duty on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy for being allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
While parties supporting Catalonia's independence won last year's regional elections with a small but significant majority, these parties have struggled to stay on track this year, as several of the most prominent leaders have either emigrated or have been imprisoned and are awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who filmed a protest on his phone to support police, said the conflict had been fuelled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, one of Catalonia's nine leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in custody since last year and is on trial, said he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"The candidacy for the European elections is the best way to expose the backsliding of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government has directed against us," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after crashing into a building
Three men (33, 34 and 39 years old) were arrested after the car was repeatedly struck against a building in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective inspector Bob Blemmings reported that the gate and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that a crossbow shot was fired on the car at the same time.
Menga blow allows Livingston to win the Rangers with 1-0
The first goal of Dolly Menga was a victory for Livingston
Supported Livingston stunned the Rangers, bringing Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as a manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Meng's hit turned out to be decisive, as Gary Holt's team offset the situation with the Hibernian.
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market.
This is the first time I’ve been to the United States.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation.
"Livingston" does not take the opportunity against dull guests
Holt's team, with their face-to-face game, which made it difficult for the Rangers in all sorts of ways, should have been in the lead long before they got the word out.
Scott Robinson broke out but delayed his goal attempt, then Alan Lithgow's attempt after slipping in to prevent Craig Halkett from hitting his head across the goal line was unsuccessful.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop guests in planned places.
This is how the gate came to be.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to give a chance to Meng, who struck and scored a goal from the middle of the zone.
At this stage, the Rangers controlled the ball, but the defense of the guests turned out to be impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) was not particularly disturbed.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos ordered Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pitman's rehearsal was interrupted by the agility of the Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov missed the goal in the Livingston combination.
In the Livingston area, centered balls continued to appear, but two calls for punishment were rejected after Halkete fought for the ball with substitute Glenn Middleton and for hand-playing.
"Phenomenal" "Livingston" performance — analysis
BBC Alsdair Lamont (Scotland) at Tony Macaroni
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was excellent, continuing to surpass expectations, constantly improving performance.
Their style of play and personalities have hardly changed since their return to the top echelon, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in maintaining first-class organized defense, while Menga ensured that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were always vigilant.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under Gerard's command, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring -- only one time they broke into the landlord's area -- and it's basically a call to awaken the "Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is greeted in Cologne with shared feelings
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of smiles and a blue sky.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
Police, citing security, blocked a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also voiced their views, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him.
The protests between the two sides reflect the contradictions created by the guest, some of whom view German Turks as a hero, while others despise them as autocrats.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies in a collision with a car
In a car crash in London, a cyclist died.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a section of road with heavy traffic in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the help was provided by the medical staff, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place several months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, about a mile from Sunday's crash site. The driver then left the crash site.
The city’s police service said the police were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been closed and buses diverted at the scene, but drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Workers Injured in Riot
The Prison Office reports that six prison staff members were injured in riots in a men’s hard-line prison.
The riots broke out at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
In order to prevent riots involving eight detainees, which are enclosed in one wing, employees of the special service "Tornado" were involved
The staff were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison staff were involved in resolving the incident at the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will not accept violence in our prisons and say clearly that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will probably spend more time behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was being treated in hospital after the prisoner's attack.
And in October last year, staff responsible for controlling the mudslide were sent to prison to resolve serious riots in which staff had been attacked with billiard balls.
Orcan threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (probably drought-stricken areas will benefit)
Arizona rarely suffers from tropical depression, but this is likely to happen early next week, when hurricane Rosa will move with residual force across the desert southwest, posing a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to cross Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with rain late on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained their status of tropical storms or depressions within 200 miles (320 km) of Phoenix!
Catherine (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles (65 km) from the AZ borders."
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict a 2-4 inch (<0x7E>5.08-10.2 cm) rainfall, reaching up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) in some places.
Other desert southwest areas, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1-2 inches (<0x7E>2.54-5.08 cm), reaching up to 4 inches (<0x7E>10.2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the rain of Rose can be a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although the possibility of flooding is a very serious concern, some rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s road leads to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rose is still with Hurricane Force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, is located about 385 miles (<0x7E>620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean and therefore calms down.
Therefore, the hurricane is expected to hit the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning with the force of a tropical storm.
The rainstorm in part of Mexico can be strong, posing a significant risk of flooding.
“The torrential rain is expected to reach 3–6 inches (7.6–15.24 cm) from Baja California in southwestern Sonora, with precipitation likely to reach 10 inches (25.4 cm),” weather.com reported.
Rosa will move north, across Mexico as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move across Arizona and land in southern Utah late Tuesday.
“The main threat expected from Rose or its debris is very heavy rainfall in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States,” the National Center for Organs said.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsommer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in the city of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4.00 BST.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition remains "stable".
Police said 17-year-olds and two 18-year-olds, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight in the Redstock area, Avon and Somerset.
The police have called on anyone who might have mobile phone material to respond to what happened.
Trump Says Caveno Suffered From 'Anger and Evil' of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Caveno is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and violent tactics," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump stressed that Caveno had suffered the "evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Caveno testified before Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally denied any allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the excellence, ability and courage of Caveno".
"The vote to confirm Judge Caveno is a vote to confirm one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a brilliant history of serving the nation," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
President Caveno referred to the nominee by name, referring to the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I didn't stand, but I actually stand," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere, fighting for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats had taken on a mission to “protest and resist.”
The first of the important procedural votes in the Senate on the nomination of Caveno is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
Officials said on Saturday at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed away as giant waves slammed into shores after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when waves of up to six metres (18 feet) slammed into the shore in twilight, swept many away to death and ruined everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When yesterday's tsunami threat erupted, people were still on the beach and didn't flee immediately, and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it ripped everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
"Many people climbed trees to save themselves and survived," he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photographs taken during the flight by the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks of the coastal city continued to shook on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's technology assessment and application agency, BPPT, said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the Hiroshima atomic bomb dropped during World War II.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have exacerbated the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and reported the collapse of thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels.
He said the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
"Communications were completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongala," Nugroho said.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were travelling to the affected regions.
"It's already a tragedy, but things could have been even worse," the organization said.
The Agency was widely criticised Saturday for failing to report that the tsunami had hit Pala, despite officials saying the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
A video posted on social media shows that a man on the top floor of the building desperately calls people on the street below that he is approaching a tsunami.
Within minutes, the wall of water hits the shore, wiping out buildings and cars.
The news agency Reuters was unable to immediately confirm whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power supply, which cut off communications in Palu, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials said the army had begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still needed much food and other essentials.
The city airport is open only for assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
Mr. Doseba said that the employees of World Vision, who had successfully reached the city of Palu from Donggal and now live in tarpaulin sheds in the office yard, were passing the scenes of destruction along the way.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that had been destroyed," he explained.
That's very bad.
Even when relief groups have resolutely begun to organise relief for the victims of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with a great deal of experience were not allowed to go to Pala.
According to Indonesian law, overseas organizations’ funding, resources and personnel will only be allowed to arrive if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government declares, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international assistance, but that status has not yet been determined."
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami came to Palu, the friends and family of the still-not-discovered people continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that would brighten the gloomy life of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been pressed under the rubble for two days, next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, had prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those imprisoned at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were students.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I am burdened with emotions."
Mr. Gendon recalled that after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the paragliders, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages for hours to the participants of the Palu race who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
“I think that means the messages didn’t reach the addressee,” he said.
Thieves steal <0x24>26,750 during ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's employee who refilled an ATM at the Newport on the Levee complex on Friday morning.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM of the entertainment complex and was ready to fill it with more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the driver was busy, another person "run in from behind to the Brink's employee" and stole the bag with the cash intended for the ATM.
According to the press release, the witnesses noticed several suspicious persons leaving the scene of the crime, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Je
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the replacement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A messenger who previously knew him as Kanji West."
The 41-year-old West has been called Je for some time, and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June ("Ye").
This change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The creators of the show say that he replaces singer Arian Grandi in the show, who stopped working for "emotional reasons".
West has said that this is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but also has a religious meaning.
"I believe "Ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "You,"" West explained earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, it is we.
In the beginning there was Kanje, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is a reflection on good and bad in us, on our confusion, on everything.
The album is more of a reflection on who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, announced earlier this year that he preferred the words Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with Vesta, both has and has not used a dash and capital letters.
Mexican President-elect pledges not to use army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the 50th anniversary of the bloody retribution of students approaches.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday vowed to "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, a peaceful demonstration by army units was shot, killing as many as 300 people as leftist student movements spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has swore to support young Mexicans by issuing grants to students every month and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area, explains investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various U.S. government bodies made announcements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. generally lacks a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: its goal is to become a key country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double budget for AI research will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind in the U.S., and the next big breakthrough in AI is expected,” Lie said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding could double the chances that the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence will take place in the US.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an artificial intelligence system that would outperform America's best Othello (Reversi) player, but later he was a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be ready to identify people with ideas for the future.
"Scientists in the US often have to work very hard to get government grants," Lee said.
"It is not China that attracts the leading scientists, but the big companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaries to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically awarded to people with a doctorate in philosophy in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its next-generation AI development plan.
Lee explained that the National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions, similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department established a single joint artificial intelligence center, which is expected to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (the US Defense Ministry's Central Research and Development Organization) announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next."
The National Science Foundation is currently investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the United States, legislation to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in place for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" as part of a move to end a decades-long row with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's EU and NATO membership bids.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, says the name of its northern neighbour indicates claims to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists insist that the changes will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a campaign calling for a boycott has raised concerns about whether the turnout will reach at least the 50% needed to validate the referendum.
A question is asked in the referendum bulletin: "Are you on NATO and EU membership by concluding an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price to pay on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation such as a member of the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, under the guise of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have announced that they will take account of the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
To change the name, a 2/3 majority in parliament will be required.
The National Electoral Commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, activity was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Josie Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko handed over their votes in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, to Strumica in Macedonia.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and arranged the chairs by the tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to stand up with our heads up, not through the door of the servants," he said.
"We are a small country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that a majority will cast a vote in favour, as more than 80"percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote was passed.
He said the result of "yes" would "confirm our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will vote in the referendum — less than the required activity.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of voters planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government that came to power last May.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero slams through all the Brighton defenses to score
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market, which aims to ensure that the Digital Single Market is a reality.
Agvero gave the impression that his goal score in the 65th minute was ridiculously easy.
The Argentine forward got a midfield pass at the beginning of the combination.
He ran between the three Brighton guards and rushed into the free field.
Then Agvero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He bypassed the ball for one defender, then beat several more Brighton on the side of the field in the run.
Then he made a pass to the left, reaching Sterling.
The English center forward used his first touch to pass back Agvero, who used the right football boot to beat Brigton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan by hitting the ball on the right side of the net.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," City manager Pep Gardiola told reporters.
"We discussed playing for 55, 60 minutes with him.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League wrestling.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Agvero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent the ball with a beautiful kick along the caviar of the left leg of Leroy Sane.
Sané took several shots until he was assigned to deliver the ball to the farthest goalpost.
The center attacker of the Sky Blues easily rolled the ball into the net just before crossing the border.
The "City" is fighting the Hoffenheim Champions League in group games on Tuesday at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Zinshaima, Germany.
Shercer wants to cause problems for "Rockies"
Since the Nationals are not participating in the playoffs, there was no reason to reopen.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take a chance against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies are in the playoffs. And the Rockies in the Western Group of the National League are in the lead with one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market, which aims to improve the functioning of the Single Market.
"Although we play the same way, we will at least be able to have fun knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably be the most annoying one I'll face this year.
And why wouldn't I want to compete?"
It’s a great way to make sure you’re getting the most out of your day.
It is important to note that this is not the first time that a person has been diagnosed with the disease, but rather the first time that he has been diagnosed with the disease.
The right hand of "Washington" is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 streaks 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
The President encircled the situation in which his chosen candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Caveno, has entered, at the same time talking about the importance of the turnout of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Everything we’ve done in November is under threat.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It's really very, very serious — I didn't stand, but I actually stand, and that's why I'm everywhere and fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrific, horrific group of radical democrats acting right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, disgusting behavior.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to break in order to gain power and control, that’s why they want power and control and we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have taken on the mission of "protesting and resisting".
"And you yourself have seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "wrong, evil, nasty and false."
He named the senator of the Democratic Party, Dianne Feinstein, after the Senate Justice Committee, to which the audience responded with loud cries.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, wait, it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer prepared for diversity.
It is intolerant of the open
No wonder the Momentum activists in my local party wanted to subject me to censorship.
After all, I am the last Labour MP to date to be informed that he is not desirable - that's all, because we do not hide our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, and I felt the same way, because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
For the importance of economically responsible politics, for national security, for Europe - ironically, but these were issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a statement about the Labour meeting in the eastern part of Nottingham on Friday, it said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during my career as a local Labour MP were just that.
Unfortunately, today, in many meetings, the atmosphere is different and the promises of a "kinder, gentler" policy have long been forgotten, if ever.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any viewpoint is judged on its acceptability to the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy took the lead: colleagues who I think shared our political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would never have agreed to, whether it was national security or a single EU market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there’s a tirade of social media use calling for a ban on running for office in the next election, denouncing the centre’s policy, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments made against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day, but never try to quietly avoid it.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal exploitation has become.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation prepared for diversity of views, and with every expression of distrust or change in the rules of selection, the party is shrinking.
Over the past two years, I have often been given advice, asking me not to jump to hives, to think about what I am talking about, and then I will be "all right".
But that’s not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a pupil in response to the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had literally led to the collapse of my integrated school class, I have set myself the task of fighting for better public services for those who need them most, both as a member of the local council and as a government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, not even in the previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingham had any reason to doubt my position on political issues and on areas where I disagreed with the existing government.
To those who pushed the proposal on Friday, I can only say that, at a time when the country is moving resolutely towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But basically, the only thing I want to say is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they're Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of denial or reminder that nobody is irreplaceable in politics will stop me from doing what I think is best for you all.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unsold "Ayr" reaches the highest line in the table
The last two attempts may have skewed the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting match of the Scottish Championship today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unbroken team of ten.
After all, it was both their excellent defense and the much better use of opportunities that guided the hosts, and coach Peter Murchie has all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in all our games and we're still not defeated, so I'm happy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "With all due respect to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Frazier Climo raised the Ayr, but the yellow card to Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, where he had given the Warriors to the game, changed the number of Melrealose balls, and Jason Baggott.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation.
However, Melrose started the half-time with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Begott reduced the lag to 5 points.
It took a long break for Ruaridh Knott to be severely injured and transported away from the field on a stretcher, but when the game resumed, the Ayr made rapid progress when Stafford McDowall made the rehearsal, which was carried out by Klimam.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and once again, under intense pressure, Melrose used an excess of players, with Bruce Colvine's attempt, which was not carried out.
However, the hosts got excited, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for catching Klima without a ball, from the penal corridor, McPherson made a slap in the back of the Ayr Pier.
Klimo carried out the ball, as before, almost from the very resumption, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong on the pitch and sent the flank player Gregor Henry to the hosts' fifth rehearsal.
"Still Game" star seems to be planning a new career in the restaurant business
The star of the comedy series "Still Game" Ford Kieran seems to be planning to get involved in the hospitality business, as it turns out that he has been named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he co-creates with his longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that next season 9 will be the final season of the show, and Craiglang is apparently planning his life for Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun said K<0xC4><0xAB>rnan was planning to be involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant business."
"The sea belongs to us!": land-caught Bolivia hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol around the fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
The flagships from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In land-caught Bolivia, memories of Chile’s lost shoreline in the bloody 19th-century conflict for resources are still alive, as is the longing to sail in the Pacific once again.
These expectations are probably the highest since decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit and, of course, awaits the outcome with positive thoughts," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the judgment of the International Court of Justice on big screens throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's demand that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has the duty to discuss the granting of sovereign access to Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, is also deeply interested in Monday’s verdict.
"We are close to recapturing the Pacific Ocean," he said.
However, some analysts believe that a court ruling in favour of Bolivia is unlikely, and if it is passed, no major changes are to be expected.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to allocate Chilean territory, and its representatives have said that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final hearing shows that the case "was not complicated", explained international normative expert Paz Zarate from Chile.
And the last four years have not brought Bolivia's case forward, but, on the contrary, have delayed it.
“The question of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales's bellicose rhetoric has stifled the remaining goodwill in the Chileans, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate once, but after that it will be very difficult to hold a discussion.
The two countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, disagreed with the unusual speed of the court’s decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict that will benefit both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the seas as political cops.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will give up nuclear weapons only when it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to eliminate their nuclear weapons unless they could trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the two leaders’ meeting in Singapore.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared ready to resume deadlocked diplomatic efforts to prevent a nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri says it’s “fantasies” to hope that the U.S.’s continued sanctions and unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean War will ever make North Korea kneel.
Washington is wary of agreeing to a declaration before Pyongyang takes substantial disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are skeptical about whether Pyongyang really wants to give up its armament, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim’s next meeting with Trump.
Paris Fashion Show Introduces The Latest Massive Headgear Line On The Road To The High Street Near You
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented the audience with a row of absurd, huge head-on items in the spring/summer 2019 collection that dazzled against the backdrop of style set by Paris Fashion Week.
The highly impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their astonishing achievements to the fashion show.
Valentino’s finest design was a gorgeous beige beanie with a wide featherlike edge that swallowed his heads.
Massive accessories included jewel-covered watermelons, a magic hat and even pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your heads warm.
Tom Brown also made a strange selection of masks —just before Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn lips, and they were more for Hannibal Lecter than for high fashion.
One of the formations was reminiscent of a diving breath, with a tube and glasses, while the other resembled a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue with massive fashion, then the time has come.
The spectators of the style believe that huge owls are probably on the way to the High Street closest to you.
Oversized hats immediately became popular after "La Bomba" appeared — straw hats with two feet (<0x7E>60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn all over, from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The status of a very impractical hat as a cult object in all social networks led to another big creation on the tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as big as the model in a swimsuit carrying it.
The reddish-yellow raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringe and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place in the spring/summer 2019 collection of "Jacquemus' La Riviera" at Paris Fashion Week.
celebrity stylist Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in the street stores of the central business next summer, because the designer has left such an impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge-sized accessories."
John Edwards: Language skills are vital to the world's citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a reputation for excellence in education and have maintained this reputation in 2018, when once again outstanding exam results were achieved, further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, the arts, music and other public events.
These schools, with a total of 30,000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of education for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set a goal to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their life as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement specific school programmes, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it remains in his consciousness.
If you speak his native language, it remains in his heart."
It is a compelling reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relationships and gain the trust of people from other countries.
Taking into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest number of exams passed in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who taught foreign languages reached the top grade A.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools’ data on 74 schools shows that 72 percent of students got the highest grade in Chinese, and 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now as highly valued as subjects of choice in the programmes of independent schools as those of the science-technology-engineering and mathematics group.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers cited a lack of language skills as a reason for failing to fill vacancies.
As a result, language skills are increasingly becoming compulsory to prepare young people for future careers.
With growing job opportunities that will require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will be a real benefit for them in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a multi-language speaker.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit number of people, 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Multilingualism, especially in developing countries, will give children better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in the languages they teach.
Some schools will focus more on the more common modern languages, while others will teach languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for Britain's future, according to plans for 2020.
No matter what your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be specialists in the field.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future.
At present, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this fact should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire (It must be done).
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
The fans have finally waited for LeBron's first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in a pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to be decided how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
He was asked about his plans for the Lakers' series of six pre-season games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off a series of rallies today in Willingham, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned meetings next week, including a stopover at friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his vacancy at the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump’s goal is to gain support in the upcoming interim elections because of the risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress after voting in November.
When will Trump’s rally in West Virginia take place today and how will it be watched online?
Trump’s rally in Wiling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m., after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to speak about this week's hearing of Supreme Court candidate Bret Caveno's case, which has been strained by allegations of sex crimes, and a Senate vote is expected to delay approval for a week while the FBI conducts an investigation.
However, the main purpose of this rally is to help improve the situation of the Republicans expected in the elections in November.
President Trump’s campaign thus shows that the task of next week’s five gatherings is to “activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans strive to protect and increase the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congress control over his agenda is so important that the president will visit the state as much as possible as we start a busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who did not want to reveal his name, told Reuters.
This evening’s rally, planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Willingham, is likely to attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will be featured in Pittsburgh’s media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia senator candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind according to polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to help improve his polls," Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Raider Cup 2018: US has shown determination to fight to keep high hopes for Sunday singles
After three sessions "in one word" in the format of the Wednesday afternoon game "foursome" probably was exactly what this Raider Cup needed.
Athletes love to talk about fluctuations of luck, and they really believe in it, especially in competitions such as these.
So, which side do they think is successful now?
"They were in the lead with six points, but now with four, so I think in a way it means that success has turned to us," said Jordan Spieth on his way.
Europe is, of course, a priority, because it is in the lead with 4 points, but 12 more will be played out.
Spit explained that Americans believe that the wind blows on their sails and they have reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast three points out of four.
The spit has been destructive from the first blow to the lawn, and is an example of a winner.
Those gutulous victories became louder as his round continued, a decisive kick was made in the hole to four times achieve the same number of kicks, when he and Thomas were two kicks behind two after two.
His punch in the hole that brought them to victory at 15 was perceived with a similar cry from them, of his belief that the American team had not yet been pushed out.
“You really have to dig deep and worry about your match,” Spit said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 holes to succeed.
The only players who have scored more than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly make it into the history of this Raider Cup.
The strange but attractive couple of Europe is four points behind and will not be able to hurt.
Mollywood was the only couple to survive without a boggy on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided boggies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This process and the way their energy flows into this raging crowd and back convinces them that they are the players to win on Sunday, and Fleetwood and Molinari will be the most popular players who can secure a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk of a European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly coped with this morning's fourball hero Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Boggy and the two doubles in the front of the nine led the Spaniards and the Swedes into trouble, and they were not even close to breaking out of it.
But on Sunday, there is no one to help.
In "fourball" and "foursome" formats, it is so exciting to watch nearby due to the interaction of couples, to watch what advice they give and what they do not, and how the strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is far in the lead before the last day, but this "foursome" race showed that the US team is determined to fight, which many, especially Stateside, have doubted.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
The European team will start the last day of the Raider Cup in a pleasant lead after Saturday's fourball and foursome finished in lead with 10-6 against the United States.
Inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over hardworking Tiger Woods, raising the score of Le Golf National to four.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, to keep the trophy lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over the inaccurate American team in the morning competition in the format of fourballs, and the series scored 3-1.
The United States resisted the foursome format more vigorously, winning two matches, but failed to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Fury's team needs 8 points in Sunday's 12 singles to keep the trophy.
In addition to the provisions of this Article, Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities of the other Member States have access to the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article in a manner that is consistent with the principles of sound financial management and that is consistent with the principles of sound financial management.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the format of "fourballs", they easily defeated tired Wood and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau in a brilliant game with an even more sensitive 5&4 score.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, scored a great game at times, but he lost 19 of the 29 matches in the fourballs and foursomes formats, plus seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before the morning fourballs, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson's foursomes to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka on 2&1, who rank first and second in the world rankings.
Europe did not manage to reach its full potential, even though the day in the south-west of Paris was a pleasant and light breeze.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competitions, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They squeezed 2&1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the format of "fourballs" and returned later to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with the 4&3 "foursomes" after losing their first two pits.
Only two times in the history of the Raider Cup, the team has played a 4-point deficit singles, but as the owners, Farik's (Furyk) team is enough with a draw to keep the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, as it seems, Sunday counterattack will be problematic.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally, without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister on Saturday informed the United Nations that continued sanctions had deepened its mistrust of the United States, and North Korea would never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho informed the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea took "significant steps of goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear weapons test site, and never proliferation.
"However, we do not see an adequate US response," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will never unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known reproach for Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, under which Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement left an impression because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim and Donald Trump at a meeting between the first US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has attempted to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also not backed down on its call to ease serious international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists that 'denuclearization must come first' and raises the level of pressure generated by sanctions to achieve the goal by force, even opposing the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions could put us on our knees is empty fantasies cherished by people who do not know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our mistrust."
Ri didn’t talk about his intentions for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US leader had specifically mentioned in a speech at the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the minister highlighted three Kim meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other side in this denuclearization issue was South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
But Ri’s speech was dramatically different from what he said last year when he told the UN General Assembly that a North Korean missile strike on the US mainland was unavoidable after “Evil President” Trump had called Kim a “rocketman” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but stressed that there is still a long way to go and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he hadn’t set a specific timeframe, stressing that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for what it has done.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without making mistakes until final and convincing denuclearisation has been achieved.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to bring Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes to a halt.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and was subsequently informed that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but just hours later North Korea accused him of "requiring a gangster-worthy claim."
At a meeting with Muna this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the weapons site and the nuclear facility if the U.S. takes "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea wants to see are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students will learn a subject on how to relax enough
A new subject at Harvard University has made students sleep more this year, an attempt to counter the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which involves studying caffeine over and over.
One professor found that students at the best universities in the world often did not even have a basic understanding of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a subject he thought was the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create a new subject after talking about the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end, a girl came up to me and asked, 'Why am I only being told this now that I'm in my final year?'
She found that no one had ever explained to her how important sleep was — what surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
Launched for the first time this year, the subject provides students with a basic insight into how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting achievement and overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, informed that the university decided to introduce a training course after learning that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week of study.
The hour-long training process includes a series of interactive exercises.
One of the parts is an image of a dormitory door, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of bedtime routines.
In another part, students are informed about how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then the map of the campus with interactive icons invites participants to rethink their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students at once.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how your health will be affected by cigarette smoking," added Professor Chaisler.
He said that a culture that boasts of being able to learn all night long still exists, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that enough quality sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into fasting mode, making it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaseler develop the subject after attending one of his lectures last year, Harvard’s first year.
He said that the subject had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course accessible to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students who are in postgraduate education to study a similar program before going to enjoy the competition.
Professor Chaisler advises students to install an alarm not only when they get up, but also when they go to sleep, and also to keep in mind how people are harmed by the "blue lights" emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lamps, as they can disrupt the circadian rhythms, making it difficult to fall asleep.
It’s also a great way to make sure you’re getting the most out of your day.
The Rangers were hit by another horrific game when Dolly Menga beat Steven Gerrard for a 1-0 loss to the Livingston.
Ibrox hoped to win their first outing since February's 4:1 St Johnstone, but Gary Holt secured Gerard's second loss in 18 games since becoming manager of the club, and his team is 8 points away from the Scottish championship leader Hearts.
Menga hit the ball seven minutes before the end of the half-time, and the Rangers' lack of inspiration did not appear at all after an attempt to level the result.
The Rangers fall to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third place, and only Hibernian beat it in terms of goal difference.
And there may be another problem for the Rangers, because the assistant to the judge, Calum Spence, needed medical help due to a head injury apparently caused by an object thrown from the far end.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, quickly leaving the Ayr behind, reaching the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livingston 11 players who took away one point from the Hearts last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-trained team crushed opponents in each episode.
It is possible that the Rangers more often managed the ball, but the Livingston made better use of what was their behavior.
They should have scored just two minutes after Menga's first hand sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate, but the center player missed his big chance.
Then the long free kick of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to send the ball far past the rear post.
The rangers took control, but the impression was that playing in the last third was hoped, not believed, that it would happen.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly believed that he should have scored a penalty kick in the 15th minute after colliding with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly wasn't particularly disturbed, neither by Lassana Coulibaly's head-shot, nor by the modest outcome of Ovie Ejaria's attack.
If you’re looking for a new job, then you’re looking for a new job.
"Rangers" already once again did not cope with the long combination planned by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fired a ball on Scott Robinson, who kept his balance and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Gerard replaced Coulomb with Ryan Kent during the break, and this almost immediately affected the game, as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly immediately rushed to block from his line.
However, Livingston continued to make the guests play as they please, with Litgov and Halket taking one long shot after another.
Holt's team could have continued to lead in the final stage, but McGregor played well, stopping Jacobs before Litgov took a head-on shot from the corner.
The rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, demanded another penalty kick late in the game after colliding with Jacobs, but Thompson ignored the request again.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany was born Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who grew up as a physicist.
Geiger developed a method to measure and measure radioactivity, which ultimately resulted in a device known as the Geiger counter.
The science-backed Geiger counter has also taken its place in pop culture, such as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which the main roles were played by outwardly inconclusive cowboy scientists Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the fuck is that?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you'll be able to hear how the atoms work, which are released because of the radioactivity that these minerals produce."
Evans: "Really, it really bounces!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention named after him continues to live on.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to 'see' evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells and kill them
Vaccine therapy teaches the immune system to recognise evil cells
This method extracts immune cells from the patient, which are transformed in the laboratory.
Then they are able to "see" the protein, which is characteristic of many malignancies, and will be injected back into the body
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of malignancies.
A woman who was being treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize bad cells experienced that her ovarian cancer had gone away for more than 18 months.
The technique consists of extracting cells from the patient's immune system, converting them in a laboratory so that they are able to ‘see' the HER2 protein, a protein that is involved in several tumours, and then injecting these cells back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of malignancies," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explained Professor Berzovsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells are obtained from the patient, which are "trained" to attack the cells of malignant tumors, has worked in one type of leukemia.
After visiting SNL, Kanye West, dressed in the MAGA hat, attacked Trump’s critics.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was swept away during a Saturday Night Live show after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After completing the third song that night, titled "Ghost Town," in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he began to whisper loud phrases about the democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to white people, they ask, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist!'
Well, if I was worried about racism, then I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody with Matt Damon in the lead role, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the material with Vesta's regrets was uploaded on social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to ridicule West in this way.
West complained to the audience that he had been mistreated behind the scenes because of his headpiece.
"They ridiculed me behind the scenes!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on your head!"
They laughed at me!
And they said I've lost touch with reality," West said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You can't see what happens when you lose touch with reality?" and promised to put on "your Superman's cloak," because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love!”
"Variety" reported that his comments caused the audience to whistle at least twice, but the show's team members looked embarrassed, and at least one person told the press: "The studio was completely silent."
The West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days ago from a friend, rapper Max Miller.
West bewildered many with the song (I Love it) he performed in a champagne bottle costume.
Vesta was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the strongest people in the spirit: THANK YOU THAT YOU DO NOT WORRY!"
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West simply "was who he is, and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or his clothing, or supporting his art) who I believe supports and barks with an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we also," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he had now become "a presence previously known as Kanji West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and does the same as Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly Snoop Lion, and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, but then to the "stage artist, formerly known as Prince".
Indictment of attempted murder for stabbed in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harrington turns against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known as the swordsman John Snow in HBO's merciless medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has turned against the stereotype of a brutal hero, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think that they need to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought there was a "problem" and asked how to deal with toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also aged 31, admitted that this problem is important to him.
“I can’t help but think about the mistakes we’ve made with the masculine,” he said.
"What do we teach young men in the aspect of this problem as they grow up in light of the existing problem?"
Kit believes that television with its highly masculine characters may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued, "What is innate, but what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they need to be perceived as men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because there are clearly problems with the young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any Game of Thrones sequels or prequels, after the series ends next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses are fed up".
Starting in November, Kitt will play the lead role in the revival of Sam Shepard's "True West", which is the story of the film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considers his meeting with his wife Rosa as the best thing that happened to him as a result of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show because it was kind of securing my current family and my life from then on," he said.
The Rose Emmy Award-winning fantasy series featured Kita character John Snow's beloved Igrit.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS has risen sharply by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual intercourse, indicating a change.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the state, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of underprotected sex in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
This is the first time I have ever seen a woman in my life, and I’ve never seen a man in my life.
The U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday denied claims that her staff member had posted personal information of three Republican senators on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the allegations were spread by ultra-right wing whistleblowers and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly includes residential addresses and telephone numbers belonging to U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unnamed congressman, during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexually inappropriate conduct by Bret Caveno, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred some time after three senators interviewed Caveno.
Conservative, internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records was linked to Waters’ office, and revealed information about a Waters staff employee, Hills said.
"This unfounded claim is absolutely false and a complete lie!" insisted Waters.
"An employee of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false statements is in no way responsible for the leak of information.
This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and a complete lie!"
Waters’ statement soon sparked online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleisher wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not match that of a congressman.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, that person should not be angry.
He must not be belligerent.
He may not speak on the motives of the accuser.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fletcher's task was to compare Waters' reaction with the fall of the Democrats for Judge Caveno, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee to get Waters to lose her seat in the midterms, also tweeted.
"Great if true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted officials and law enforcement agencies to the fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified," she continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for all their work, which is destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
Johnny Anglis 3 Review: Rovan Atkinson's Parody of Spy Films Half-Blooded
It has become customary to look for associations with Brexit in every new British-flavored film, and this seems to apply to the revival of this Johnny English parody adventure comedy franchise, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and was revived in 2011 with "Johnny English is back".
Is a teaser for ourselves, for how obviously hopeless we are, a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Angle, with his fluffy eyes and unusually moving face, has the right to create a mess after the second revival—his name, more than anything else, signals that he is a broad-spectrum comic character designed for areas where consumers don’t speak English.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his strange claims to charming sophistication, is a bit of Cluzo, a bit of Mr. Bean, and a bit of the guy who plays one note in the music of "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
He is also based on the traveler and international, incomprehensible character Atkinson once portrayed in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials in which he left the chaos on his way.
The latest adventure of Johnny England has at least one or two lovely moments.
I loved the place where Johnny Angle goes to the helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the blades of the propeller creep at his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's ability to visually create a comic impression is well visible, but the humor is rather weak and strangely superficial, especially since "serious" film brands, such as "007" and "Mission Impossible", themselves confidently use comedy as one of the components.
Humor gives the impression that it is dedicated to children, not adults, and I think Johnny England's absurd troubles are not as creative and purposeful as Atkinson's silent movie tricks in Bean's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyberhacker has hacked Britain’s secret spy web, revealing the identities of all British agents in this field, to the displeasure of an active agent — the deplorably small role played by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a prime minister, a pompous and conflict-ridden person who has already lost all political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing what she can with a character like Theresa May, but there is not much to do in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since all the active spies have gone public, she will have to summon someone who has already retired.
And this man is the incompetent Johnny Anglis, who now works as a teacher in a fine educational institution and quietly teaches how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because Anglis offers to learn the profession of spy from the ground up.
The Englishman is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former much-affected assistant, Bo, who is also played by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a fun character who only becomes important at the end of the film, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully exploited.
And so Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of Her Majesty to make huge mistakes and meet the beautiful fateful woman Ophelia Bulletova, portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime ministers have been dangerously obsessed with the charismatic tech billionaire, evil Jason Walt, portrayed by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problem.
Coal and Bo begin their odyssey of wild fun: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create confusion by sneaking into a luxury yacht in Volta; and Coal causes absolute chaos by trying to use a virtual reality-on-head display to get to know the interior of the Volta building.
Everything possible is being done for the ending, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, it contains many elements of children's television.
Lots of moderate elements.
As with other films by Johnny England, I can't help but wonder if the British film industry could give Rovan Atkinson a role that would take full advantage of his talent.
The Labour Party denies plans that Britons will work four days a week and get paid five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is due to discuss a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week and receive a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants business executives to give the money saved through the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers by giving them another holiday.
In this case, the employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend while receiving the same salary as before.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trades Union Congress, which sees it as an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour MP told The Sunday Times: "The policy changes are expected to be announced by the end of this year.
"It won't happen in one day, but a four-day week is an idea that fits the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall strategy in industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week already in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as such does not support these cravings at the moment.
A representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's politics and the party does not consider it."
Shadow Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to shape his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell explained that he was determined to take away power from the "mass of directors" and the "speculators" of the public service company.
The shadow cabinet minister’s plans also mean that existing average shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire package, as the Labour government could make a “deduction” due to injustice.
He also approved plans to include workers on company boards and create exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees who receive dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John F. Kennedy answer "60 Minutes," or the FBI's investigation into the Caveno case could change their minds
An investigation by the FBI of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could lead a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley questioned Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham on whether the FBI could uncover something that would change their minds.
Kennedy left a more open human impression than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy replied.
"I said, turning to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Caveno.
I called him after it happened, when the charge became known, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was resolute, direct and unequivocal."
But the vote of Grema is apparently carved in stone.
"I've made a decision about Brett Caveno, and there's going to be a destructive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett resolutely denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names were able to confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don’t think there will be any changes.”
What is the World Citizens’ Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizen’s Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: to reduce world poverty.
This is the festival’s seventh year, the World Citizen Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will gather in the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, the rappers Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an event created by the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people to actively fight poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was a wish to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "activities", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant activity to raise awareness of the end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way of persuading people to act, or is it just another case of so-called "clyctivism" where people feel they can really influence something by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims that it has registered more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters since 2011 in pursuit of various goals.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than USD 37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and statements stemming from its activities for which at least USD 10 billion had already been disbursed or financed.
The group estimates that the allocated funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and enforcers committed to “helping children grow up to their full potential”, vowing to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, governments in other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can leave a legacy of malnutrition and social injustice," Tracey Ullman of The Power of Nutrition told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also mentioned that after launching more than 5,000 measures calling on the UK government to provide better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "Power of Nutrition" project, which will provide nutrition for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen commented: "It will be a long and long road, where we will stumble and fail at times.
But just as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements have done before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy to block Russian energy exports, Interior Minister says
"If necessary," Washington may use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s activities in Syria – especially in places where it operates as part of the legitimate government’s invitation – were a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason why it is in the Middle East is because it wants to supply energy in the same way it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its navy, can make sure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot bring its energy to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed an audience who had come to attend an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with the situation in Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are virtually the same.
"The economic opportunity for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, referring at the same time to Russia as a country whose economy is largely dependent on fossil fuels.
It is said that the Trump administration is promoting the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump administration officials, as well as US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which would, according to Trump, make Berlin "dependent" on Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s fervent resistance to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has expressed its opposition to Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she was seriously considering running for president after midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for president.
"It's time for women in Washington to salvage an imperfect government, which means a female president," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy for the U.S. presidential election."
During a council meeting, Warren referred to President Donald Trump, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
“I’m deeply disturbed by what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his selected Supreme Court candidate, Brett Caveno.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "Of course, an FBI investigation is needed before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s supporters do not believe she should stand in the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said that a senator should not stand for election, according to a survey by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this decision.
The survey found that former governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, receiving 38 percent for standing and 48 percent against.
In addition, in connection with a possible candidacy in the 2020 elections, such high-profile Democratic Party names as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders appear.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have to make.
Sarah Palin quotes Trek Palin in PTSD at Donald Trump’s rally
Trek Paleyn (26) spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into military service in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through after he returns, I can apply to other families facing the consequences of PTSD and a certain amount of vulnerability that our soldiers return to," she told the public at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an "obvious problem that everyone turns a blind eye" and said of her son and other war veterans that "they are returning a little different, they are returning fortified, they are returning wondering if what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to this country is respected."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasil Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of a weapon while under the influence.
18 States in District of Columbia Challenge New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a brief briefing to a court advisor in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker facing the hurdles posed by the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Sessions case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and his violent gang member's sons" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to a large proportion of U.S. asylum seekers, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are a common problem.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Prosecutor General of the District of Columbia Karl Racin said on Friday that the new policy "ignores national, federal and international laws introduced for decades".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and such an obstacle violates this principle," he said in a brief statement.
In addition, he said that policies preventing immigrants from entering the country were damaging to the U.S. economy, as these immigrants were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions appealed to immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse.
"Asylum is open to persons who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear related to their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," he said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, with the number of casualties doubling in the search for survivors
The situation became increasingly difficult for the survivors.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, comforting his hectic baby at the evacuation centre of the devastated town of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance service brings in new victims.
There is a shortage of clean water."
The residents were visible, returning to their destroyed homes and digging up the water-soaked items, trying to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken spine and shoulder, slept outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being cared for outside because of the constant violent aftershocks.
Tears came to his eyes as the powerful earthquake began shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I was printed in the ruins of the wall," Harry told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of using propaganda ads to intimidate
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad, daily highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited China Daily’s paid supplement to Iowa’s top-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, saying it was a new stage in the growing campaign of Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently dragged into an escalating trade war, as a result of which they impose a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China’s repressive tariffs were targeting exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion to Sunday's Des Moines Register, arguing that China "now doubles this intimidation by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the tradition of freedom of speech and a free press to America’s advantage by posting a paid advertisement, ‘Des Moines Register,’” Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, here at the normal Beijing news kiosk you will find a limited number of different views, and you will not see such a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have in relation to China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is here under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most influential newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans estranging female voters from midterm elections involving the Caveno scandal
With many leading Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will face a negative reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions associated with it have been extremely high, and it can be seen that the majority of Republicans were ready to give up their vote.
“These things cannot be reversed,” Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse’s Maxwell School of Science, told The Hill on Saturday.
He doubts that senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be a reason enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national representative for the progressive movement MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters in the hallway of the Senate sang "November is coming!" when the Republicans, chaired by the Judiciary Committee, chose to continue with the candidacy of Caveno despite the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news portal.
"People say it's already at a high level, it's true.
However, it could be even higher, especially among the hesitant voters living in the suburbs and younger voters (aged 18 to 29), who often do not go to the polls even if they do not like the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she outlined allegations of sexual abuse by a Supreme Court nominee, analysts point to a possible failure if Republicans continued to nominate the nominee.
"This has become a messy chaos for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News early last week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or whether or not Caveno will be convicted, it's also about how the Republicans have handled the situation and treated him," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, who heads the group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans have been somewhat divided as to what to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Caveno, slightly more inclined to believe the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are definitely or mostly inclined to believe the Ford testimonial, while 35 percent say they are definitely or mostly inclined to believe the Caveno testimonial.
Moreover, 38 percent said that Caveno may or may not have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian newspaper reported that, at Flake's instigation, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Caveno, at the age of 17, had committed a drunken sexual assault on her.
Ramireza claims that the candidate for the post of a judge of the Supreme Court during his studies at Yale in the 1980s showed her his genitals at a party.
Global Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Take Over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend "Inrupt" is a company based on the Berners-Lee open source platform "Solid".
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who is allowed to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention is to "dominate over the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to build their own "personal online data repository", or PTD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time in the same browser.
Personal online data storage is unique in that only the user determines who and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls this “personal authority through data.”
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the company with the resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently includes Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some freelance developers hired to work on the project, and a community of voluntary coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren't talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change by completely reversing all of their business models overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a report published on Saturday by Medium, Berners-Lee said Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based web.”
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet into a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in discussions on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new web era," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Marking of the Victorian Cross awarded to a clergyman during World War I
For 100 years, the only clergyman of the Church of England has received the Victorian Cross as a fighter during the First World War.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vence received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglissei and Lehaucorte.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so he never knew about the highest British military award.
In a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "excellently symbolic" that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the significant award.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vence led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick fog and cannon and machine gun fires."
Later, he rushed to the shooting line and with the utmost courage led the line forward before taking the cannon zone, where he defeated three groups.
Lieutenant Colonel Venus was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Ven (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, and which at the same time is also a very humble action.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a wreath after the parade, accompanied by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Ven said he felt "honoured to take part in this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evidenced by the support provided by so many people".
It’s a great way to make sure you’re getting the most out of your day.
Imagine you've been up all night to see Bellator 206, but in the end you're not allowed to watch this major event.
The San José poster included 13 battles, including six on the main map, which were broadcast live all night on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were shocked by the switch to Peppa Pig.
Some were genuinely puzzled when they had stayed awake all night until dawn, waiting for the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the change of the broadcast to a children's cartoon as an "unfortunate joke".
"The government has determined that this type of content is not acceptable after 6.00, so there was a switchover to a children's program," Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, explained the change of transmission.
"Piggy Pepa," "yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said he will be working on scheduling so that viewers in the UK can see these broadcasts in the future.
"Thinking about re-broadcasting, I think we'll be able to sort it out somehow," Cocker said.
"But the clock is there at six in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on that.
Believe me, after switching the transmission, a lot of texts appeared, and they were not positive.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't. It was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that next time there will be no such problems.
We will stick to five fights instead of six (as it has been so far). We tried to please the fans, but we tried too hard.
This is an unfortunate situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Tom Daley didn't feel good enough about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started high school.
During his visit to the first Radio 4 program, Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had begun to talk about homosexual rights in order to give others "hope."
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent manager of the long-term program, has gone on several months of sick leave.
Appearing as an outcast from society in Lavernes' first program, Dale said he felt "inferior" to others as he grew up, because "in society it is not accepted that both girls and boys can be liked."
He said, "Today, feeling that I'm not as good as others or that I'm different has been the main driver that has given me strength and endurance to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove there was "something" so as not to disappoint people when they finally learn about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile leader of the LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for even more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had decided to address the public because he felt happy that he could live openly and uncomplicatedly, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "surprised unprepared."
Dale married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year and claimed that the age gap was never an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much at such a young age" (his first Olympics was at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone at your age who has experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"A year ago, all that was important to me was getting a gold medal," he said.
"Do you know what? There are more important things in life than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert bears the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale mentioned that his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked Dale was if they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, where he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him she'd be gone to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I had been dreaming of all my life - to plunge into front of my home at the Olympics. There was no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song, Heather Small's "Proud", which resonated with him on the road to achievement in the Olympic Games and continues to make goosebumps.
The programme "Desert Island Discs" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 British Summer Time.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Raider Cup match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid an unfortunate turn of events.
For the 12th time in a two-yearly championship, Captain Jim Furyk put Mikelson on a reservist bench for Saturday's four-ball and two-pair matches.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as has so often been the case with the US teams, the five-time winner split his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of correcting what is bothering him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the tense fight in Le Golf National's rough field, where imprecise kicks are regularly punished.
And if the game itself isn’t scary enough, Mikelson will fight the exact winner of the British Open in Sunday’s ninth match, Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with junior Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in starting 12 singles games, succeed in the lead, the Mikkelson match could prove to be crucial.
It’s not just a question of how much money you can make.
"He was fully aware of his role today, slapped me on the back, put his hand on me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He is very confident in himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who has given so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen him play two games.
I imagined more, but everything went the way it went, and that is what we will count on.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug is not recommended for children under the age of 3 years.
This could mark the end of the Raider Cup career, which has never really coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven draws, although Furik claimed his presence gave the team some non-material benefits.
"He's cheerful, sarcastic and witty, he likes to have fun on people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to tease him this week too, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than just a game."
The European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a significant rise in leadership can quickly disappear.
The European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a significant lead in the fight for the Raider Cup in the last day’s singles can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
He made his debut at the 1997 Games in Valderrama, where the rival team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, scored a five-point lead over the Americans, but only now reached the finish line with a very small dot lead, winning with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we were significantly ahead in Valderrama; we were in the lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only with a little lead," said Bjorn (pictured), watching the 2018 graduation group victory with 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday, taking the lead with 10-6 on the golf course "Le Golf National".
So history will show me and every member of that team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will give up everything.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
It will not be over until you see the points you have scored on the screen.
Our goal is to get this trophy, and let's focus on that.
I've always said that I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of who's on the other side of us, the greatest players in the world."
Facilitated by the performance of his players on the golf course, Björn added: "I never had a good time too early.
Tomorrow there will be new challenges.
Tomorrow provided individual games, and it's a completely different thing.
It is great to have a partner next to you when everything goes well, but in individual games your golfing skills are fully tested.
This is the message you need to give to your players, namely that they give up everything in the next day's game.
Now you are leaving your partner, and he also has to go show his best performance."
Unlike Björn, captain Jim Furik will make sure his players show their best performance in individual games, not in partner games, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furik himself has been on both sides of these major tournaments of the last few days, both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn, and then suffered a defeat when European teams achieved a sensational success, later known in the golf world as "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, 1999 captain of the team, brought his players together for the final day of the fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get to the fast-paced moment you experienced in Brooklyn, like you experienced in Medina.
When such an impulse is transmitted in one direction, it creates a lot of pressure in relation to mid-games.
We made up our lineup accordingly and ranked the guys in the way we thought it right. Let's try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of attempting to lead the counter-attack, and he ranked Rory McIlroy in the main game and the Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulterer in the first part of the list.
"I rank the guys in this order because I think it fits best in the tournament," said Björn regarding the singles.
Germany’s new warship to be put into service again
The latest frigate of the German navy was due to be put into operation in 2014, thus replacing the aging Cold War warships, but this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the Baden-Württemberg frigate class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reported, citing a military official.
The ship was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but the unpleasant post-delivery problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the navy back in 2007 will replace the old Bremen frigate class.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signal reception.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods: it should be possible to accommodate new frigates for up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuous delay means that the state-of-the-art warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power overseas, will already be obsolete by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was noticeable in all the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship back to the shipyard after it was delivered.
The reasons for this step were little known, but the German media cited a number of significant "software and equipment defects" that would make the warship invalid if it were used on a combat mission.
Software flaws were a particularly significant factor, since the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 seamen, which is only half the staff of the senior Bremen frigate class.
It also turned out that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to make improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the costs of the whole project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
It is said to have cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion instead of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems associated with the new frigate are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings about the shrinking of the German navy.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the navy is indeed "starting to run out of usable ships".
The official stated that over time, this problem has grown significantly, as the old ships are taken out of operation, but no new ones are delivered to the site.
He regretted that none of the frigate class in Baden-Württemberg had joined the navy.
"National Trust" listens to the secret life of bats
The new study, which is being carried out at a Scottish Highland property, is aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape in their food search process.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to contribute to their future protection measures.
Scientists from the Scottish National Trust will study dwarf bats, pigeon bats, as well as brown-eared bats and water bats in the Invereve Gardens in Westeros.
Special recorders will be located in the main places of the property, which will track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Sound experts will analyse all records to determine the frequency of bat calls and which species carries out the specific activity.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed landscape view that reflects the behavior of the bats.
NTS conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management such as grassland creation and how best to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the last century, the population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly.
These lands are threatened by construction and development works affecting the shelters of bats and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypaper and chemical treatments for some building materials, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to locate insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bat problem very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who carry out regular surveys, inspections of bat hideouts and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization has even established the first and only special bat reserve in Scotland, Threave, on the Dumfries and Galloway estates, home to eight of the ten bat species found in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson claims that this area is ideal for bats.
"Here's a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a habitat that is generally suitable.
But there are still plenty of things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He points out that it is important to check that there are no bats in the area before the maintenance of the property is carried out, as up to 400 females and their young may be killed by the unintentional destruction of one of the female hideouts, possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and should not be killed, tortured, disturbed or destroyed in their hiding places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a staff member of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, has called on the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for several of their species, we just don't know how they're doing."
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Accusations by Ordering Lawyers to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has denounced the rape charges against him as "fake news", saying people "want to get their attention" by using his name.
His lawyers have been ordered to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
A football star of Portuguese origin and Turin Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
A few hours after making these claims, Ronaldo, 33, turned to his 142 million followers via an Instagram online video, calling the information "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, that's part of my job.
I am a happy person and everything is fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel magazine for making allegations they have described as “providing unacceptable information on the basis of a suspicion of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz mentioned that the player will claim compensation for "moral damage to an extent commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident occurred in June 2009 in a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly went back to the player's hotel room after reading at the nightclub, where he anally raped a woman.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the application of this Regulation.
It’s a great way to make sure you’re getting the most out of your day.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 30a to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the application of this Regulation.
The 34-year-old woman says she no longer wants to accept the terms of the settlement, as the incident left a lasting trauma.
If you’re looking for a job in a foreign country, you’ll want to find a job in the foreign country, or you’ll find a job in the foreign country.
Brexit: UK would "forever regret" the loss of automakers
"The UK will 'repent forever' if, after Brexit, it loses its position as the world leader in car manufacturing," said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He is "disconcerted" by the fact that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that delays at the borders in the case of Brexit without an agreement could put jobs at stake.
Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota models "Auris" and "Avensis", last year produced almost 150 000 cars, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped,” said Toyota Managing Director Marvin Cooke in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the main concern is the supply chain at risk if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “quick time” basis, where cars made to order receive parts every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be disruption at the border, which could lead to some delays and shortages.
According to the company, it would not be possible for Toyota to retain more than one day’s worth of inventory at its plant in Derbyshire, so it would have to stop production.
Clark said theresa may's exit plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the current moment, but also to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 on Today.
“The proof of this, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we must be able to fully pursue a very successful supply chain strategy.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be halted, but warned that rising costs in the long run would reduce its competitiveness and ultimately jeopardise jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and works at the factory as coordinator of the unification of the union, said his members were becoming increasingly worried: "I can say from experience that as soon as a position disappears, it does not come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed, White House reports
Trump’s key meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight against Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Caveno continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in Russian elections, the link between Trump’s actions and Russia, and possible rule of law violations by the president.
For months in Washington, there has been rumour that Trump will sack the deputy attorney general and thus threaten Miller’s independence.
In the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed recording a conversation with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president with an amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, where there were talks of his resignation.
It was reported that Trump was meeting Thursday at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Trump said he "would rather" not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary hearing, which was witnessed by both Caveno and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders visited "Fox News Sunday".
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, taking into account all the things that are happening around the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters contest this claim: Sanders hasn’t held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Manager Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to a dislike for the television reporter’s “greed for fame,” although she added: “I don’t deny the fact that they are greedy.”
She then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press would increase interest.
"The president engages in more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," she said, adding, without giving further details, "we have inquired about the number."
Sanders said the briefings would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is certainly better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you see we've done it over the last few weeks, and it's going to be in the place of press briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences attended by key figures.
Individual press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the President demonstrated the reason for this this week in New York, devoting an uncontrolled and sometimes strange expression to the mass of reporters.
Health Minister writes to Scottish NHS staff about Brexit-related fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express her gratitude and wish them strength after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to the MSP less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of applications for permanent status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, leading to decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario in the absence of agreement.
I know that this is a very troubled time for you.
This is why I would like to emphasise once again how much I appreciate the involvement of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from inside and outside the EU provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit the patients and communities we care for.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Tennessee Tigers guard Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury in a Saturday game in which Vanderbilt Commodores scored 31-27, Tennessean sports reporter Mike Organ reported.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug is not recommended for children under the age of 3 years.
"He came to the side line and so to say collapsed," said Reed.
While Abercrombie was on the side line, the trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen, then put him on a stretcher and took him for further investigation.
A Tennessee state official told a Nashville-based WSMV reporter, Chris Harris, that Abercrombie had been removed from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
“I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that, but if I’m going to do that, I’m going to do it.”
Abercrombie, the red-shirt player, is in his first season after Ilya's replacement for the Tennessee State team.
This is the first time I’ve been to the United States and I’ve been to the United States for a while.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher state fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the UK, and the additional funds raised will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plan.
Such a move will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
The increased state fee will be applied to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The treasury estimates that up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year can be collected to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the UK and channelling the extra funds gained to help homeless people, it will announce today by Theresa May.
Such a move is seen as an attempt to counteract Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract new voters with promises of affordable housing and to reach out to the wealthiest in society.
The increased state tax will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and in addition to the money raised, it will be spent on the government's efforts to combat the problem of homelessness.
The premium included in the current state fee, including the higher fee introduced two years ago for the purchase of a second dwelling and for the purchase for rent, could be as much as three percent.
The State Treasury foresees that such a step can supplement its budget by up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London’s newly built properties are bought by non-residents, thus slapping prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get their homes.
Many areas of the wealthy country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to allow more young people to afford their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by grabbing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable housing in order to address Britain's housing problem.
Mr Korbin has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including a reform of rent control and unreasonable eviction.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new housing.
Ms May said: "Last year I mentioned that I would use my position as Prime Minister to restore the British dream of a better quality of life for every new generation.
And that means repairing our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be purchased with the same ease by foreign companies and non-UK residents as by hard-working British citizens.
For many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the harsh problem of homelessness is still present."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to run "Scotland"
Sunderland CEO Jack Ross says his biggest goal is to become a Scotland manager at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge to restore the Northeast club, which is currently third in the first league with three points from above.
This summer, he switched to the "Stadium of Light" after staging St Mirren back at the Scottish Premier League last season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I got the B Cup, and that was it," Ross told the Scottish BBC broadcaster Sportssound.
"But I grew up watching the Scotland games in Hampden Park with my father, and it's always called on me to come back.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
Rosa's predecessors in managing Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Diu Pay Canio and Gus Paulo Canet.
The former Alloa Athletic chief said he wasn't worried about following in the footsteps of such a large club's top managers, having previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich's bids.
"My success will now be judged on whether I can return the club to the premiere.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
"Returning the club to the premiere will not be an easy task, but I will most likely believe that I will be successful here only when this task is done."
Ross has only been in his managerial career for three years, having previously worked as a deputy director in Dumbarton and spent 15 months as a trainer for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling to the third level and helped St Mirren win the championship in the same season.
Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than he did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalls taking charge of the Alloa.
“I really believed that leadership was my real calling — far more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had a good success, I could live from it and enjoy some heights.
But playing can be difficult.
Every week you have to go through a lot of things.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but leadership is my field.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now I’m doing it. I think I’ve been in the right place, I’ve never felt so good all my life.”

According to the survey, the best time to enjoy pints is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday evening
The summer heat wave has caused Britain’s less popular pubs to shrink, but it has put increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The collected data showed that in July, the sales of pubs and bars had increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, who represents CGA, the business consultancy that compiled the data, said: “Continuously sunny weather and England’s protracted participation in the World Cup meant that July followed the same trend as June, with pub profits up 2.8 per cent and restaurants falling.
Restaurants, whose sales decreased by 1.8 per cent in June, experienced an even more difficult situation in July.
The situation in the pubs and bars was the most appreciative, as they experienced a much greater upturn than the restaurants experienced a downturn.
Food-based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurant workers felt.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM Recreation and Hospitality Analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend observed at the end of April.
The weather and the impact of large social or sporting events are the major factors determining the turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the corresponding period of the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the constant cost pressure.
As far as food providers are concerned, the long and hot summer could not have come at an even more inopportune moment, and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we usually experience in August will provide much-needed respite."
Total sales growth among pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a drop in brand sales.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK’s sales monitor for pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a well-established industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey reveals that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show to parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake profiles on Instagram is growing rapidly.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "pure primary" account to show to parents, and also private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Heads of Schools Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It is frightening that so many teenagers are creating online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eileen Doyle to be "Voice of the Athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning indoor and outdoor athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those driven by sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eyed enjoys great respect across the Scottish, UK and global athletics community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit enormously from being on the board," Beatty said.
Doila said: "I want to act as a voice of the athletes and I hope I can really get involved and help drive this sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200-metre and 400-metre race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, thus winning a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC pandit, was unable to pass after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "On this day a month ago, I experienced a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell if and to what extent I will recover.
It was a terrible job, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and today I can already do agility training!
Thank you for your inspiring words!”
Opinions are divided on the advertising of a breast milk pump, which compares mothers with cows
The breast milk pump company has taken care of divided views online about advertising that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
To celebrate the launch of the so-called "world's first silent worn breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an ad for a sticky rush to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cowshed to a song whose words read something like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "if you haven't noticed, it's not udders, it's my breasts."
The song goes on: "Suck, suck, I feed the babies, suck, suck, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page has caused widespread online resonance.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and commented hundreds of times, has received shared viewer reviews, and many claim that it highlights the dairy industry's "horror".
"It's a very wrong decision to use cows to advertise a product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after their birth," one wrote.
"Elvie" breast pump discreetly fits into the bra for breastfeeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentary states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
There was also an opinion: "Advertisers did not know what they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "fun".
"I think it's a great idea.
I would buy one if I still breastfeed.
Suction made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understood its idea.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commentary states: "This is a fun ad for moms who milk (often in the workplace or in the toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not advertising that glorifies or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, a group of women discover that they all danced with inconspicuous pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who milk claim to feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires and pipes, and fits discreetly into the breast-feeding women's bra, allowing them to move freely, keep their babies and even take part in events outside the home.
Anna Balarin, "Mother" partner and creative director, commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Drawing in parallel between the women who milk and the dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milking while demonstrating in an entertaining and comprehensible way the stunning sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has come to the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the tongue in a show by Martha Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent site on Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, even though as many people cross the border each month as before, partly due to the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it harder for children to stay with sponsors.
As a rule, most of the sponsors were also undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that by openly applying to take the child in, it would jeopardise their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to take fingerprints, and the data would be passed on to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously punished.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors’ household are staying here illegally, and a large proportion of these individuals are criminal aliens.
This is why we continue to persecute such people,” Mr. Albens said.
According to asylum officials, in an effort to speed up the handling of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days as provided for in the previous standard.
Many will use videoconferencing instead of coming in person to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed unfit for release will be expelled swiftly.
The longer children are held in detention, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent attacks or attempts to flee, according to information provided by asylum staff and testimonies retrieved from the system in recent months.
Lawyers argued that these concerns are heightened in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked due to their breadth.
They added that moving children to a tent town without spending enough time emotionally preparing them or allowing them to say goodbye to their friends could cause injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupier armies" to immediately withdraw troops
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s eighth year of war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were in Syria illegally under the pretext of counter-terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must step down immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes, "the war on terrorism is almost over".
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in the holy war until all Syrian territory is cleared" of both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops to Syria, mainly training and advising both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1 000 men to this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions were excellent for them to return and blamed "certain Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears", which made the refugees unwilling to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicising what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until there is an agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last rebel foothold in Idlib has made it possible to speed up political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement "has deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda-linked group Jabhat al-Nusrah, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committees, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian state in the committee, stressing that the work of the group should be limited to "revision of the articles of the existing constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Be Elected for a Second Term
From this point of view, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless, and this is probably what many liberal observers hope, impeachment and scandal will put an end to his presidency prematurely.
And then 'this will be the most dramatic presidency final of all time!'
At the moment, there is no sign of a slackening of the observers.
Since 2014, CNN's best-performing ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation, in particular as regards the following:
"It's a fire that attracts many people because it's something we don't understand," explained Neal Baer, the backbone of ABC's "Designated Survivor" drama, which tells the story of the Cabinet Secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, comedy writer-veteran and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club have her own theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" said Miss Scowell.
The chaos is, to some extent, entertaining.
Of course, unlike everything else that can be seen on TV, the news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rou v Wade judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, and the state of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged observers can afford.
And yet it's more than being an informed citizen when you watch an expert panel at six o'clock to discuss how Bob Woodward has used unnamed sources of information for his book "Fear," by Mr. Storm, details of Paul Manafort, what a <0x24>15,000 bomber jacket from ostrich feathers and leather will be.
I’ll never see Super Mario again like I did before.
"Part of what he does that gives the impression of a reality show is that he gives you information every day," Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "Pawn Stars", explained about the changing team and daily developments of Trump's show.
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you'll fall behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleiss that week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai was sunny, 80 degrees (<0x7E>27<0xC2><0xB0>C), but he was sitting in a room where he stared at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to withdraw, not even when Brett Kavanaugh had to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and his future in the Supreme Court was in danger of falling apart.
"I remember the time when we were making all those crazy shows, and when people said, 'It's the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fletch told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the pre-election campaigns of the most tense parliamentary midterm elections
No wonder Pennsylvania's 17th congressional constituency aspires to receive money thanks to the transformation of congressional districts, which will result in two existing deputies fighting for one seat.
This recently restructured Pittsburgh suburb is linked to the Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in a special election last spring in another district.
Lomb will fight another current member of parliament, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, the maps were revised.
Competition in the new 17th district has led to a struggle between the parties' main financial groups: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lemb became known in Pennsylvania when he won the March elections in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district by a small margin.
The Republicans had held the place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won in the area by 20 points.
Political experts expect democrats to have a small majority.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then reconsidered
The diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners threw the Trump Organization’s management team at the door.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of a "recent decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore," department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received about <0x24>140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include a reduction in financial assistance and a targeted restriction of visas, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and murder rates have reached their highest levels.
In the course of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being, which would have followed a similar meeting last year that was recognised as a rapprochement effort to prevent migrants moving to the US.
In mid-September, the country’s top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively putting an end to considerations of punishing El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mika Pence had now decided to attend a conference scheduled for mid-October to show how serious the administration was about the meeting.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesperson, speaking on behalf of Mr. Bolton, was reluctant to give further details about the debate that was described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to negotiate internally if their anonymity was maintained.
It’s important to remember that you’re not going to have to pay for everything.
Researching History
The second stone in the garden could be a report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller that Mr. Trump may have obstructed a justice that has a lot of evidence at the disposal of the public.
It is said that Mr. Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the other party prevails in Congress, Trump will have to answer to this body and possibly to his peers’ jury at the very moment when he is about to meet his constituents again.
There’s a lot of “but” and I’m not saying that Trump’s fall is inevitable, or that it will happen to his European allies.
There are choices that we will all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to coup against Hitler if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to escape the years-long carnage.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now faced with a number of such milestones.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been struggling since it was reported last year that he proposed to secretly record a conversation with the president and wondered about his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that the story of The Times is not accurate.
“How do we respond if the FBI investigation we have just requested into Brett Caveno isn’t complete or fair, or if he is confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice despite his dishonest testimony and credible allegations of sexual assault?”
And, most importantly, will we vote in an interim election to Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to face all these challenges, democracy will have a long winter.
However, I believe that we will succeed with reference to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future if I have such a legacy?"

The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 30a to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the application of this Regulation.
In addition to the provisions of this Article, Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities of the other Member States have access to the information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of this Directive.
"We can be happy about it, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old footballer.
"We went into the game believing that we would be able to achieve a good result, and we got this point.
Maybe we could have beaten them in the end, but overall, a draw is a fair result.
They may have been better in the first half, but we broke off in the second half and were a better team.
And Thursday will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game because they scored well in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue fighting and achieve good results.
Last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, it was clearly difficult, but now there are new trends that I feel good about.
The team is great and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, leave last season behind and succeed."
Women can't sleep because they're worried about their pension savings
Although they knew exactly what kind of care they wanted, few had discussed the matter with family members.
About half of the individuals in the national survey indicated that they did not talk to a spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
"People want to be cared for by family members, but they don't do anything to discuss it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Agency.
This is where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You can not prepare your family for the fact that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known well in advance.
Work with your counsellor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor. Your advisor can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with a sum of money to cover those costs, or securing your assets – the key is to have the money.
Develop your own legal documents. Prevent legal battles before they even begin.
Talk to your health authority so that you have a reliable person who will monitor your health care and ensure that specialists act in accordance with your wishes if you are unable to express them on your own.
Consider also the possibility of granting a financial mandate.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of paying your bills if you can’t do it on your own.
And do not forget the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is taken to the hospital for emergency care.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Indicate these facts in a written plan, so that such a situation does not surprise you unprepared.
"And it's not just about finances, it's also about who's the doctor," Martina said.
"What are the drugs used for?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure you have such a plan in place."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to government information, at least 384 people were killed in the strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, and the number of victims is expected to increase.
Due to devastated communications, rescuers have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggal area, which lies north of Palu and is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16 000 people in Palu were evacuated after a devastating natural disaster.
Here are the basic information about Pala and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary with an earthquake and a tsunami.
Dongala is an area that extends about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwestern coast of Sulawesi Island.
It is estimated that the county, which is part of the province's administrative region, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the economic pillars of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal Dongala area.
Nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite bank of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Donggal.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic-active Pacific Ring of Fire, where earthquakes regularly occur.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nia, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Java, Indonesia's most populous island, in the south, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake erupted near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, causing tsunami waves up to 10 metres high that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A near-surface earthquake struck the area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded of the destruction caused by the devastating earthquakes and tsunamis of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested over alleged domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Peylin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a female friend tried to call the police to report what she claimed had been a crime, he took her phone.
In addition to the above, we may also share your personal information with third parties, such as advertisers, advertisers, and advertisers.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked if he found himself guilty, he said he was "not guilty at all."
He has been charged with three Class A offenses that can result in a one-year prison sentence and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which can result in a day’s imprisonment and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palatine has been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Peylin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported that an attack had taken place.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, delaying the report of domestic violence, and carrying a weapon under the influence of intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he will hit her with a fist in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Peylina for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder when returning from Iraq.
Earthquake Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and has devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been destroyed and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake erupted near the central part of Sulawesi, southeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social networks are spreading videos showing the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to demand a rarely used death sentence for a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in the city of New York, killing eight people, a rare form of punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
As alleged, 30-year-old Saipov used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, where he shot down pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the execution, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious injury, as stated in the statement of intent to apply for the death penalty filed with the South District Court in New York.
According to the judicial document, both charges can lead to the death penalty.
In the weeks following the attack, the federal grand jury accepted a statement of indictment of Saipov’s prosecution in 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the purpose of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of cruelty and damage to motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and prior intent", prosecutors said, citing Saipov's attack as "horrible, cruel and inhuman".
"In the statement of Erifullo Habibullaevic Saipov (Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov) injured, harmed and caused damage to the families and friends of these people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Erifullo Paicz, Erifullo, D<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>n D<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>n, (Ann-Laure), D<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xAD><0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xAD>.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since prosecutors at the Southern District Court in New York carried out an indictment that could lead to the death penalty.
The accused Khalid Barnes was charged with the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The last execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple sentenced to death on charges of involvement in espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, as days and months passed, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not express regret about the attack.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
According to the indictment, Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching a video of ISIS on his phone.
Police said he had also asked for permission to display the ISIS flag in his chamber.
He has rejected 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "quite naturally dissatisfied" with the indictment's decision.
“We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty instead of accepting admission of guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the injury that is being done to all parties involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defence team has previously urged prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Conservative MEP says Brexit negotiations should be entrusted to NAID<0xC5><0xBD>EL FARO<0xC5><0xBD>
Nigel Farage vowed at a conservative conference today to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former leader of Britain’s Independent Party said politicians should feel the anger of eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested that talks with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that Britain would have left long ago if Mr Farage were Brexit minister.
However, the challenge that Mrs May will have to face in trying to consolidate her torn party of contradictions was demonstrated by the Conservatives who support remaining in the EU and joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain her compromise plan for the future of British-European relations (the Chequers compromise) and is being attacked by those who want to leave the EU, by those who want to stay in the EU, and also by the EU itself.
Allies insisted she would make a determined effort to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative reaction and make Eurosceptics and Labour choose between her offer and "chaos".
Mr. Boun, "Leave Means Leave" at a rally in Solihull announced that he wanted to throw May's plan into the dungeon (to chuck Chequers).
He proposed to make Mr Farage an ally and to entrust him with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been on the floor, we would have already left," Boun said.
Wellingborough MEP added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw away May's plan!"
Justifying his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight to be slaves!
We want to make our own laws in our country!"
Mr Bouna ignored allegations that public opinion may have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who are actually doing all the work and electing us.
Please give up the Chequers and start listening."
In a message to May, she added: "Prime Ministers remain in their place when they deliver on their promises."
Mr Farage said politicians at the rally must feel pressure if they are to ignore the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let them do it."
In his message to a enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to put pressure on our politicians who are going to hand over Brexit.
"We will call on the people of this country who allowed us to win the Brexit battle, and we will never relax until we make ourselves an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, they marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Unknown activists greeted the Conservatives with anti-Brexit banners after the group's meeting this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Workers' Party ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they experienced with the party's applications at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the IT system in order and all their technology for Canada and yet, and yet, for an undivided border, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"This is an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to carefully consider running for president of the United States
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider carefully" running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at West Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November and is running against GOP Republican Geoph Diel, who was vice president of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that she will be the main one who will dare to stand against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters through the town hall since Trump took office.
A visitor asked her if she was planning to run for president.
To which Warren replied that it was the right time for "Washington to have women who will salvage the imperfect government, which means the female president."

Baton Rouge Police Station announced the arrest at 11 a.m. of Daiteon Simpson, 20 years old. ET Press Conference.
On Friday, they broadcast a video of the shooting, calling for help in identifying the man seen in the video.
A hundred and twenty were shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"The face of Sims was shot in the head, resulting in immediate death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, over 247 Sports.
Way rushed to defend his friend and the Simpsons shot him.
The Simpsons was interrogated and confessed that he was at the scene of the accident, with a gun, and admitted that he had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and is in the East Baton Rouge village police station.
6 feet 6 junior, who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team lets him beat Sebastian Vettel
If you’re looking for a new job, then you’re looking for a new job.
From the start, Botas started well and almost left Hamilton in the dry, defending his place in the first two trips and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
The first time he walked into the garage and left Hamilton in the driveway to deal with the rest, this was probably the deciding factor.
The Mercedes driver filled the lap later and lagged behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued to take the lead after balancing the forces, which saw the Ferrari driver persistently leave the inside free, risking to be left behind by a double maneuver to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and at the end of the first circle was the seventh in his 21st birthday.
He was then in charge of a large portion of the race, as he focused on the tires to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kimi Räikkönen in the fourth.
In the end, he arrived at lap 44 in the garage, but was unable to speed up the remaining eight laps, as Räikkönen was fourth.
This is a difficult day, because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job of getting one and two," Hamilton said.
It was very bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed senator Diana Feinstein for her insistence on not disclosing a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, in which she accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony to the Senate Legal Commission, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are "evil, nasty and unreliable."
"One thing that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in recent days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, nasty and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read the press releases and the leaked information and then they say, 'Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Remember that?
Diane Feinstein, have you leaked the information?
Remember her answer to the question... did you leak the document? — "Oh, oh, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do that."
Okay, wait a second.
Whether we did it...No, we didn’t do it,” he added, in the senator’s intonation.
A letter was sent to Feinstein in July detailing what Ford accused of Cavendish, and the letter was released in early September, but Feinstein denies it happened in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t ‘flutter’ her story,” Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did."
But her denial did not please the President, who commented on the situation at a Saturday evening rally: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that democrats use the accusations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power by any means."
“You see the evil, the nasty, they don’t care what they hurt, what they have to destroy to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
In addition, it is important to ensure that you do not have to worry about the safety of your personal information.
The Giants had an early lead with Patrick Dwight and Francis Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney led the homesteaders before Dwight restored the Giants.
It is important to note that this is not the case in the case of the United States.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the Adam Kiefes guys who won the Dundee 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth team meeting this season that the Giants had won in the previous three games.
Dwight opened the game in the fourth minute with a 3:35 kick from Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford assisting Bovilier doubling the score four minutes later.
After a tense start to the game, Sullivan put his homemates into the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward passed to Cowney to score a goal and level the score at 15:16.
Dwight made sure that the Giants regained control at the first opportunity when he scored his second goal at the end of the first period of the game tonight.
It is important to note that this is not the first time that a person has been diagnosed with the disease.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Neilsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he also confidently scored in the final period to lead his team to victory.
The Giants, who lost in four of the five games, will play their next game on Friday, where they will meet Milton Keynes at home.
The air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to escape during an earthquake
One air traffic controller in Indonesia is praised as a hero after he sacrificed himself for a plane with hundreds of passengers to safely take off from land.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue in the area, and many are trapped in the mud in the town of Palu.
But despite his colleagues saving their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Ganavan Agung refused to leave his job in Mutiara's Sis Al Jufri Airport control tower in Palu, which swayed violently.
He stayed at his post to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower, thinking it might collapse.
Later he died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC news reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We are heartbroken to hear it," he fills.
Meanwhile, national authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the national disaster prevention agency says access to Donggal, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It is believed that the beautiful will grow, because many more people's bodies are under the rubble, and there is no access to many," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of 6 meters devastated Pala, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance service brings in new victims.
Clean water is a deficit.
Small shops everywhere are crowded."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’ll find there.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and said to the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was already shaken this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Now "Air Niugini"says that one of the people is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight during which it crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people is missing, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release on Saturday afternoon that they could not answer for one of the passengers, a man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local residents helped rescue other passengers and crew by boat after the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were hospitalized.
The airline said six people remained in hospital until Saturday, all of them in a stable condition.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the plane crashed into the lagoon shortly after taking off from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the length of the runway was being overestimated.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says he and the other passengers were able to get out of the sinking plane using emergency exits, as the water was just up to the waist.
He said the stewardess fell into panic and screamed, and that he had a slight head injury.
U.S. Navy sailors who worked nearby to improve the ship’s berth also helped with rescue work, using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) under water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airlines over the past twenty years, none of them are related to Air Niugini.
Psychoanalysis commentator explains the course of events at the night when a woman was burned alive
The accusation on Saturday provided evidence in a retrial in which a man was charged with burning a woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, a psychoanalysis commentator at the U.S. Department of Forensic Science, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the information from the phone to put together how 29-year-old indictee Quinton Telle and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers acted the night she died.
Rovlets said he had received location data from several phones suggesting that Tel was with Chambers on the night of her death, challenging his previous testimonies, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the indictment asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming he was in a Sanford car that night, Sanford said he was "lie because my car was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tel said he only knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers's death, Telis deleted the text messages, calls and contacts he had received from Chambers from his phone.
"He erased him from his life," said Hale.
It is planned that the defense will present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The band "The High Breed": What is a conscious hip-hop?
The Hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative views on this genre of music, giving a positive message through their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that hip-hop has deviated from its origins in terms of political messages and those that address social issues.
The band wants to return to the roots of the genre and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like "The Fugees" and "Common" have experienced a recent revival in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Black again?!
In New York, a nanny sued a couple for sacking after receiving a “racist” message
In New York, a nanny sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received an erroneous text message from a mother who complained that the nanny was "again black."
The couple denies being racist, equating the trial with "extortion".
Lindsey Plassko-Flaksman, a mother of two, expressed her disapproval when she found out that the new carer, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"IN NETHERLANDS, BACK THE BLACK," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent the message not to her husband, but to Maurice, and twice.
To apprehend her awkwardness, Plasco-Flaxman's "confused" discount on Maurice, stating that her former African-American nanny had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino, referring to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one working day and sent home with Uber.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug is not recommended for children under the age of 3 years, but for children under the age of 3 years.
"I want to show them they don't do these things," she said in a "Post" Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejects accusations that they are racist, arguing that Maurice’s employment was a reasonable decision, because they feared that after insulting her, they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco, a husband, said "Post."
"But would you entrust your children to someone whom you treated rudely, even if it was only because of an error?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Plasko equated the court hearing with "extrusion", saying that his wife had given birth to the little one only two months ago and was in a very "difficult situation".
"You really approach someone in this way?
This is not an acceptable course of action," added the investment banker.
While proceedings are still ongoing, public opinion quickly judges couples on social networks, disparaging them for their behavior and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington's book were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very surprising to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
Claiming that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before feeling inspired to write a book for children about a little teddy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "sweetly bitter" after his father's passing away last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she calls a "very important member of the family," her father quietly boasted of his eventual successes.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and was not bragging," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who achieves something: you're proud even if you didn't do it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although this was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all merits to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye by phone to my dying daughter
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice with ambulances, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Ned called regularly and said it was very bad and that she was not expected to survive," said Ednana-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Ned saying that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to maintain her heartbeat slowly came to an end and left her body.
She would have died sooner, and it was all over now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not howl or scream, because I was in a situation where there were families and people around.
I needed a lot of strength to control myself."
After all, then already the daughter of the bereaved, Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I shook my head and tears ran all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women attach cards to bridges to prevent suicide
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide act to help others not to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey strengthen the cards at the Welsh Bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers so people can call and get support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to experience what I do every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said that her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognized him by a smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "illuminated" always and everywhere."
However, he gave up work before he died because he was in a "very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after Tyler committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that this will have consequences."
Davis made cards, "to let you know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don’t have to sit in silence; you have to talk.”
Humphrey, who has been a friend of Davis for years, lost Mark, her husband, for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he would feel sad or depressed, or that he would feel quotes in any way," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude has changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning - when the children opened the presents he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
His death was a big trauma for the children, but they have to deal with it: "It upsets the whole family.
That divides us.
But we all have to keep fighting."

The future of Brett Caveno hangs in the air as the FBI launches an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he's asking for -- in terms of time and scope of the investigation -- we could probably get a little consensus," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission was "dividing" among the fortified guerrillas.
Why do the supporters of Caveno and his Republicans not want the FBI to investigate?
Their abstention is just a coincidence.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 30a to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation.
George W. Bush calls the senators lobbying to support Caveno, who worked at the White House during Bush's time, and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently holds 51 seats for Republicans and 49 seats for Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Caveno can win at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to rule on the vote and approve it in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership has "reduced" the number of North Korean political asylum seekers
The number of North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korea's lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Unification Ministry of South Korea, said there were 1,127 political asylum seekers last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
The park said that tighter border controls stare North Korea and China and high rates of human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are ultimately offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most travel through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers political asylum seekers as illegal immigrants and deports them forcibly.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearization talks.
It happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Yongun in Singapore, when, in large trains, they agreed to cooperate in order to liberate the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions on the lack of progress in the talks.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in the security of our country, and under such circumstances, we will never be the first to unilaterally disarm," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Caveno "hysterical" and claims he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the Chamber, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno "hysterical" and claimed that he was unfit to work in the Supreme Court due to his temperament.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t stop thinking that if the woman had behaved like this, they would call her ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her response to Caveno’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Commission on Thursday.
Caveno emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment to Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial argument, Caveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and tormenting, talking about his family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the Democrats on the Commission, citing the accusations against him of “grotesque and concerted destruction of character” organised by the Liberals, who are angry at the loss of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Caveno's testimony was the basis for his inability to work in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he had a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the attitude with which he treats Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked if she would try to question Caveno if she was approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he isn’t fit to serve not only in the Supreme Court, but also in his existing job in the court,” Pelosi said.
Caveno is currently a judge at the Washington County Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possibility that Caveno would make decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Way, because he was seen as a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Caveno bypassed the questions of whether he would reject the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"It's not a good time for a hysterical and duplicitous person to work in court, but one would expect us to happily say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'" Pelosi said.
But women need to hold their hands.
It is denunciation, for months and years everything has accumulated "over the edges", but she is not allowed to get it all out of herself by crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinema told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She continued, "Once upon a time, I was very helped by a woman who was the manager of a company, who said that she too was crying when she was angry, but created the technique -- when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I am angry."
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are only partially recognized as a form of anger discharge, because they are misunderstood at the very core.
One of my most vivid memories is from my older job, which had a high percentage of men, when I once cried because of an inexpressible anger, when I was caught by an older woman, a reserved manager (a woman), whom I always had a little fear of dragging me into the stairwell.
"Never let them see that you're crying!" she said to me.
"They don't know you're overwhelmed.
They think you're upset and just happy that you managed to "scratch under the skin"."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his pre-election campaign for president.
In 1987, when Hart, caught in an extramarital relationship, left the ship, also known as "doing a fool", and withdrew from the election, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the election and the last they wanted was another one.
There were those who called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
She was late in the campaign, she lagged behind in fundraising and promised that she would not take part in the election unless she raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that many of her male supporters who donated <0x24>1,000 donated only <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was very emotional - thankful to the people who supported her, disappointed in the system that made it very difficult to raise money and address voters rather than delegates, and angry about sexism - where she was "suffered".
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to him.
"You would think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.

The main excuses about how the U.S.-China trade war started are hidden and until the battle is over, disagreements between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued a first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting units worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), immediately imposing half of the goods exported to the US from China.
Beijing also "kindly" responds every time, the latest being five to ten percent rates on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has stated that it is committed to responding to the US one-on-one and it is doubtful that in the near future, the world’s second largest economy could tremble.
In order for Washington to step down, it would be necessary to agree to certain requirements, but it would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Xi Jinping to bow to the US in public.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision was made, either in Washington or Beijing, could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries, which are really more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a New American Security researcher focused on Asia.
Syria is "ready" to take back refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily take back refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country that has been plagued by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation on land is now much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
There are all conditions for refugees to voluntarily return to a country that they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people are still living in the country and are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Almualem said that the Syrian regime would accept help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditional aid or help from countries that helped sponsor the unrest.
The European golf team sensationally wins the Raider Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raider Cup, beating the US team with a score of 16,5:10,5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when the team led by the Dane Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, which was necessary to beat the US national team.
If you’re looking for a new job, then you’re looking for a new job, a job, a job, a job, or a job.
Italian golfer Molinari played brilliantly in all his stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever scored a 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament was played in its current format.
The American Jordan Spit with 5 to 4 sensationally lost the European team, according to the rating, to the lowest player Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to Ian Polter of England, who probably won the last Ryder Cup.
Serhio Garcia, a veteran of the eight Raider Cups, became the best player of all time from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"Usually I don't weep, but today I can't control my tears."
It was a difficult year.
I am sincerely grateful to Thomas that he distinguished me and believed in me.
I am very, very happy that we have regained the cup.
It’s a great way to make sure you’re getting the most out of your day.
He then gives his name to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Taigger Woods in 2-1 singles.
"The pride I feel in winning Taiger Woods grew up following him," said the 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now has a career record with 13-21-3 in the Raider Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 top-level golf tournaments, second after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find their chances, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finn, who played high-profile golf throughout the tournament.
The US team captain Jim Furick, after his team's disappointing performance, said: "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
This morning was the moment when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
With all due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and U.S. Raider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to hit your hats.
We won."
