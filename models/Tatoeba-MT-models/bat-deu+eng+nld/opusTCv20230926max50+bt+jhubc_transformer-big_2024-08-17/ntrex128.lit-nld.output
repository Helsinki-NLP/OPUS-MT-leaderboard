Some members of the Assembly were appalled at a proposal to change their name to MWP (Welsh MP).
This is due to the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could cause political political laughter at political level.
A member of the Labour assembly said that his group was concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
Welsh "twp" means "fool" and "pwp" means "kaka".
Pllaid, a member of the Pllaid assembly, said that the entire group was "unsatiful" and suggested alternative alternatives.
The We Wales Conservative Conservative said his faction was "open" to the name change, but noted that it was shortened from "MWP" to "doll" from MWP.
The welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting draft legislation to change the name change, said: "The final decision on the names of all the members of the Assembly will, of course, be the matter of the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
The European Parliament (Wales) and the Parliament of Wales (Parliament of Wales) voted in a public consultation on a proposal to give the Assembly a new name to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission gave preference to Members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP received the most support during the public consultation.
The members of the Assembly are obviously proposing alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement could become a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to table legislative proposals for amendments within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of a member of the Assembly and the plan of the committee system.
During the debate on legislation, the members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on the issue, as they should be called.
Macedonian Macedonian people vote in referendum to change name of Macedonia
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A global vote was held to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents claims to Greek territory and has repeatedly contradicted Macedonia’s aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite over the name change, said Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price you just have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
church church bells of St. Martin and other churches silenced bells of St. Martin and other churches
“The old people I spoke to said that historically, you could find a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"Today you will find neither one nor the other."
He said it was understandable why the bars disappeared.
“People communicate differently these days,” he said.
<0x60><0x60>bars are no longer a neighborhood site where people regularly gather.'
When he speaks of churches, he worries that the money from the sale of property will not be long enough, as leaders expect leaders to “and sooner or sooner or later they will return to where they began.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment blocks with cooperative apartments, in which people would live who would not help the remaining shrines.
"The majority of people who will buy cooperative apartments in these apartment blocks will be white," he said, "and therefore will hasten the moment when the churches will be closed completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built in 1870 by the White Congregations, before Harlem became a black metropolis, the metropolitan community, and St. Martin’s Church was built a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation emerged in the 1930s.
The Congregation of the Blacks, which organized a nearby service, took over the name of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by the Congregation of Blacks with the clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led a retailer boycott on 125th Street, the main Harlem store, where blacks were refused employment or promotion.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but as the parishioners of the spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, son of the spiritual father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon the bells of the poor.
The experts, who played a carillon in July, called it a different name – “a treasure treasure treasure of culture” and “an indispensable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also mentioned that this was the first carillon in the world played by the black musician Dionisio A. Lindas. 18 years ago, he started playing a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather Merriweather said that St. Martin Church St. Martin's Church did not replace him with another musician.
What has happened in the past few months in St. Martin’s Church has been a complicated story involving architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by the laity of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Sacristy—a parish governing body made up of lay leaders—expressed concern to the diocese in July that the diocese would "try to pass on the expenses" to the sacristy, even though it had not hired architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
th 13-year--year shark shark kills lobloblob 13-year-old shark in California, California
Officials said the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was catching lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
He was attacked before 7:00 a.m. in Ensinitas near the beach of Lighthouse.
Chad Hammel KSWB-TV Shows in San Diego KSWB-TV said he dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then came with a group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel Hammel said at first I thought the boy was worried when he caught a loblobloblobloblobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming: “I was bitten!
Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis Bis!
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire key skeleton had been torn out.
“I began to cry out to everyone to climb out of the water: ‘A shark swims in the water!’”
The boy was taken by plane to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was found in critical condition.
What kind of shark was the boy attacked by the shark, is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark was spotted in that zone a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper upper trunk of the torso.
Officers closed the beach from Casablad Pont to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the zone, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s Sainsbury’s plans to enter UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty departments, which will be staffed by specialist consultants.
Actively invading the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow and fashion and household goods sales are falling, larger beauty department stores will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, more stores will be set up next year.
investment in beauty grows, and supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves that were once designed for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's has announced it will double its beauty range to 3,000 product names including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time ever, Dr. PawPawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more local brands in areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The mall is also releasing its Boutique make-up range, most of which is vegan – a demand increasingly made by younger shoppers.
Fragrance Shop will also try discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
online shopping and the desire to make small daily purchases in local convenience stores requires supermarkets to do more to attract people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said branded outlets are increasingly looking like department stores as supermarket chains try to fight cheaper Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's added Argos outlets to hundreds of stores and also installed a number of Habitat stores, two years ago after purchasing both networks, which allegedly boosted grocery sales and made their acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 1900s, but the alliance ended in a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from supermarket pharmacy stores.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold its 281 Lloyds Pharmacy stores business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Lloyds' contribution to the plan was reportedly made by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the exterior and atmosphere of our beauty departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need, and thanks to its attractive environment and convenient location, we are now an attractive place of beauty, challenging the old way of buying."
Holly Willoughby cuts <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Peter Jones
Dragons den star Peter Jones is "wrared" after TV host Holly Willoughby cut <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
H. Will Willoughoughby no longer has time for their household and accessories trademark Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of this morning's 37-year-old program announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Leaving Holly Willoughby a lucrative lifestyle brand at the last moment to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV has angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources said Jones was "infur Jones," when a golden television girl at his business empire headquarters in Marlou, Buckinghamshire, admitted she wouldn't have enough time to devote to his Truly brand of household and accessories due to new deals of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was supposed to have doubled Willoughby’s assets by <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Because 37-year-old Willoughby announced she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of his chalets.
Source said: "Truly has so far been one of Holly's top priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, lasting for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave was surprisingly surprising to all.
Nobody could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
Marlou's headquarters is a full warehouse in Marlou, ready-to-s sell."
Experts believe that the departure of the host of The Morning, one of the UK’s most financially successful stars, could cost the company millions due to heavy investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household items, as well as delays in getting things started.
And this can be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a decade-long relationship with Jones Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Couples are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin, the host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity.
A nearby Jones Jones's source, a source close to Jones's, said yesterday yesterday: "We will not comment on his business business affairs."
We had a tough conversation and "then we fell in love"
He joked about criticism coming from the media for a comment that some might consider “non-presidential” and because it was positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump refuse so much why did President Trump refuse so many?
Short short short, in a smugly voice of the "new present present present presenter" in the "news host" voice, said:

Kim is interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was seen as a major step forward in North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not receiving an “appropriate response” from the US on North Korea’s early disarmament.
He noted that the United States, instead, continued sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic viewpoint in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: it was the completion of missile tests, assistance in releasing hostages and returning the remains of American troops home.
He defended his unusual attitude when he talked about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people wanting to get into this crowded arena, we’d better have about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing right in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake have devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok were deployed, this was not declared a national disaster – a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been made very clear that there is no need for international aid, so it is a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work locally.
Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were looking at the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
In view of Indonesia’s constant experience of earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, but they are not common on other coasts.
Due to the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the announced warning, the number of lost lives is likely to have increased.
The best time to travel between the many Indonesian islands is a difficult one.
As a result of natural disasters, logistics becomes even more complicated.
The hospital ship, based in Lombok, where the victims of the earthquake are treated, is heading for Palu, but it will reach the place of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo chose the reconstruction of Indonesia’s ruined infrastructure to be the center of his election campaign, he generously spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not calm down the administration of Yoko, because in the coming year he will again take part in the elections.
Yoko is also under pressure due to the persistence of sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority hold to a more conservative form of belief.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands of thousands expelled from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetete, arrow arrow bows and other simple weapons.

Tssuns deaths from Indonesian Tssun 832 deaths hit 832
According to the country’s disaster agency, Indonesia’s death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the Agency’s spokesman, told a press conference that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed by Friday’s 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which caused waves of 6 meters.
The town of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered in debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found this morning in Burkenhead, Marysside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. in Graison Miuse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police called on people who had seen or heard someone in the area to speak.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "For now, the investigation is in an early stage, but I would like to address everyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious that they would contact us.
I would also like to address anyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have captured anything with a video recorder, and contact us because they may have information that is essential for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a Berkenhead resident and was found inside the building.
This afternoon friends who think they know a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing because police have reported that they are informing the victim’s immediate relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Greison Miuse has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police said no one should enter or leave the building.
He lost his voice when he found out what had happened.
Now residents are told that they will have to wait a few hours before they can be allowed to return home.

The statue of Parliament Cromwell is hit by the final blow of the dispute over the "rewriting of history".
Its removal would be poetic justice for the actions of the Taliban, reminiscent of the destruction of England’s cultural and religious heritage, which is the responsibility of the fanatical Puritan followers of Cromwell.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick Crick's proposal as "stu stupidity" and "an attempt to rewrite history history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the transfer of statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace was inevitably to become a target.
Cromwell did not order or execute the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent image of Cromwell, created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft, is a reflection of the attitude of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of honor.
J. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people, perhaps more numerous in the late 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, which of course was a monarchy.
Whether it is depicted with full accuracy, historians have been arguing to this day.
One thing is clear: the conflict of the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exclusive figure representing one of the sides of this divide.
His achievements as the Lord’s defender are worthy to be remembered and honored and honored.”
A pig killer killed a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a man named Yuan had been found dead. Due to the damage to his artery, he was swollen with blood and lay next to a piggy in the market of Lupansuyu in Guizhou Province (southern China).
On 30 May 2005 in Sining, Qinghai Province, China, a pig farmer in a pig-slaughterhouse was preparing to administer vaccines to pigs.
On Wednesday, he announced that he and his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan were planning to go to the market to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found a relative dead and found the door open to a nearby piggy bank.
He said that there was a big boar in the piglet, whose mouth was smeared with blood.
According to the report, forensic forensics confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms has killed a farmer.
Guiyang Eveninging News quoted the Guiyang Evening News: "My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said his cousin, who gave his surname surname Wu Wu, .
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am to feed his pig on Thursday.
His body was found about an hour later.
Yuan or his cousin did not belong to Yuan or his cousin, who was torn to death by a man.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig had to be locked in order not to attack other people and kept until the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the loss of life.
Although few, cases of human attacking pigs have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, Massachusetts, and a man was particularly seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 kilograms weighed 295 kilograms pressed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and pressed it until the animal was chased away by his wife.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but the taste of blood may contribute to aggressiveness.
"They're just playful.
They love to bite, very curious... not wanting to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
"remains" of Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hurric Rosa Rose 'Re Re Re Re Re " Re Re Re Re " " " rain will bring great rain to the south-so-so-west
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken as it moves through the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring abundant rain to all of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday, Rosa was moving at 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane at 620 km southwest of Cape Eugenia (Mexico) from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, an elongated low-pressure area begins to form on the Pacific side and moves eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Californian peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, she will begin to carry large amounts of tropical moisture to the north, to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching elongated low-pressure area, will bring in the coming days a wide-spread, abundant rain to the southwest.
On site, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain will cause a dangerous sudden flooding, a stream of debris and a possible landslide in the desert.
Due to the high tropical humidity in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, precipitation will fall from 5 to 8 centimeters per hour.
5-8 centimetres of rain is expected in the south-western regions, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Due to the disorganized nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions are possible.
In the face of a tropical storm, it would be a particularly bad idea to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into torrential rivers, and thunderstorms could cause wind and dust surges.
The approaching elongated low pressure area will bring some local heavy rainfall to parts of the southern California coast.
It is expected to receive more than 1 centimetre of precipitation, which can cause a small stream of debris, and the roads can become slippery.
This would be the first rainfall in the wet season in the region.
Tropical torrential rains some of the scattered rains will begin to approach Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday, and then the rain will spread later on late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain after the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will spread on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, it is possible to experience intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic cools down, but in the tropical zone it will be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to huge changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday was a great example of huge temperature differences in the central United States.
Temperatures in Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) are almost 20 degrees different from those in St. Louis and Di Moin (Iowa).
The summery warmth of the next few days should rise again and cover more places.
Warm October is expected to arrive in most of the central and eastern parts of the United States, from the Great South Plains to the northeastern regions, with temperatures in many parts of the United States warming 27 degrees Celsius.
Temperatures in New York City are expected to rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that temperatures in the eastern United States will be higher than the average per-year temperature in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing hearing in Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people on six television broadcasts on Thursday watched the attention-grabbing speeches by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the accusations of sexual violence in the 1980s by woman Christine Blasey Ford.
The political deadlock continued, however, after broadcasters interrupted regular programs due to Friday's last-minute change: Arizona Senator prepared an agreement for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, who was drunk at a high school party, was groping her and trying to take off her clothes.
Kavanaugh, in an angry witness, said that he was absolutely certain that this was not the case.
Nielsen reported Friday that more than 20.4 million people may have watched the broadcast.
The company has calculated the average number of viewers who watched the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in counting people watching TV in offices.
To make it easier to understand, it's the same audience size you'd get at a playoff football match or an Oscar award.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh Kavanaugh’s can Kavanaugh’s Kavanaugh, was ahead of all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers at a full-day trial of an average of 5.69 million.
ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS received 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, NBC 2.94 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
At the end of the hearing, interest remained high.
The main drama figure of Friday night was Flake.
After a small Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, when protesters yelled at him as he tried to take the elevator to a court committee hearing.
CNN directly filmed it with its eyes down as it was flooded by people.
“I stand here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told: "You have power when so many women are powerless, so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and added that he would have more to say at the Court Committee hearing before the elevator closed.
Cable television and broadcasting networks later discussed directly when the Judiciary Committee voted for Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Senate.
Flake said he would only do so in the knowledge that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which the Democratic minority had called for.
Flake, after talking with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partially convinced.
After talking with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s choice had power because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.

From the Popocatepetl volcano, ash erupted, which reached the southern surroundings of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the activity of the crater became more active and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The Center observed many thunders and tremors.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash on the windscreens of cars in the vicinity of Mexico City, e.g. in Chochimilke.
Geophysicists have observed that activity from a volcano 72 km southeast of the capital has increased since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.

Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters clashed with riot police for independence and thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s secession vote.
A riot police force was slapped with eggs and powdered paint to stop a group of masked separatists. This caused dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The police used sticks to stop a fight that started later in the day.
Within a few hours, the groups for independence, singing "Un forgotten, unfor For Unforgot, unforgggable," were confronted by unionist protestors who shouted: "L long live Spain!"
The local press reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries suffered during protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is sung by Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
The majority of voters decided to become independent, but the majority of those who boycotted the vote, who did not want to break away, had a low turnout.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1 000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as police across the region tried to stop voting in polling stations.
Independence groups set up a camp on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who is taking part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer sure about Catalonia's prospects for independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
"I've watched my parents shout happily to those who can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital and difficult victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to keep up the momentum this year after many of their most prominent leaders left for voluntary exile or are in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Police-backed mechanic Joan Puig, 42, who filmed the protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is constantly rising," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, has announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.

Menga strike secured Livingston 1:0 victory against Rangers 1–0 against Livingston Livingston Menga
Livingston Dolly Menga's Dolly Mengos Dolly Menga's first goal guaranteed victory
Livingston surprised the Rangers by forcing Steven Gerrard, acting manager of Ibrox, to lose in the second of 18 games.
Dolly Menga’s hit hit Dolly Menga turned out to be very important, as in a moment Gary Holt’s team was on a par with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has lost the away game in this season of the Premier League and will meet with the Hearts next Sunday, eight points behind.
"Before that on Thursday, the Rangers will play in the Europa League Europa League home home game against Vienna Rapid Rapid on Thursday.
At the time, Livingston extended its unrivaled series of unmatched games in the division to six, and head coach Holt has not yet tasted defeat, as Kenny Miller only replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses odds in match against shook guests
Even before Holt's goal was scored, Holt's team should have been in the forefront a long time ago because of their persistence, which poses the Rangers various problems.
Initially, Scott Robinson broke through and kicked across the gate, then Alan Lithgow slipped out of the way to reach the ball passed by Craig Halkett's head, and the ball rolled down near the gate.
The hosts didn't worry about letting the Rangers play in the front because they knew they could make trouble for guests by creating standard positions.
That is how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free kick and Livingston began to push forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to pass the ball to Menga, who stopped it and scored a goal from the middle of the penalty area.
Since then, the ball was controlled by the Rangers for longer, but the defense of the hosts was insurmountable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no work.
The game continued in the second half, although Kelly had to work hard to counter Alfredo Morelos's goal.
Scott Pittman shot the Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor with his leg, and then, after another Lithgow shot by Livingston's standard position, the ball flew near the gate.
The passing ball was constantly in the Livingston penalty area, but each time it was kicked out, and two demands for a penalty, one due to Halkett's collision with Glenn Middleton after the substitution, and the other due to hand-to-hand touch, were not met.
Analysis Analysis of the Phenomenal Livingston Livingston Performance Analysis
BBC BBC Scotland Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont Alasdair Lamont from Tony Maccaroni arena
The phenomenal game and result of Livingston.
All of them were excellent and continued to exceed expectations for the ever-improving gameplay.
The style of play and staff haven’t changed much since returning to the top league, but Holt deserves great credit as he set the team on fire when he arrived.
He was supported by many heroes.
Captain Halkett played an amazingly well-organized defense, while Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to remain vigilant.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they played great under Gerrard's leadership, this time they didn't have enough to reach their level.
They made few decisive kicks and only once broke through the defense of the hosts. A kind of anxiety bell for the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Erdogan Erdogan Erdogan in Cologne Cologne was met in various
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
Leaders quarreled over issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to Turkey’s largest population community outside of Turkey.
Police banned 25,000 people from gathering in front of a mosque for security reasons, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, have also sought to be heard in condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to meet him at home.
Different protests show the division of visitors: some Turks in Germany consider him a hero, while others flock and call him a dictator.

Long Lartino Prison. Six officers injured in the turmoil
The Prison Service reported that six prison officers were injured in a major upheaval in a men's high-security prison.
The riot occurred at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. at BVL, where it continues.

Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hurroro Rose Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods Hur Hur Hur Hur Hurricricrice Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (for arid areas this may be useful)
It is not uncommon for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this is exactly what will probably happen next week, when Hurricane Rosa with its remaining energy will stretch across the southwest of the desert and this will create a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced its surprise at a flash flood in western Arizona on Monday and Tuesday, spreading toward southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday as it approaches rain on late Monday.
In Phoenix, the National Meteorological Service said that only “a dozen tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or tropical depressions no more than 322 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
hurricane Katrina (196767) was a hurhurhurhurhurhurhurhurhurhurhurhurhur Hur Hurricricric Katrina (1967) not more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
Using the latest models from the National Hurricane Center, prili precipitation is forecast to be between 5 and 10 centimetres, while in parts of Mogolon Rim, Arizona, precipitation is forecast to reach 5 centimetres.
The other southwestern areas of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to reach 2.5 to 5 centimeters, and in some places can reach up to 10 centimeters of precipitation.
For people who are not threatened by sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some may benefit from it, as the south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to data from the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from a very severe drought, which is the second-highest category,” weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels to the coast across the entire California Peninsula, which belongs to Mexico.
Rosa, still a hurricane category with a huge wind speed of 137 km/h, is 619 kilometers south of Cape Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is confronted with cooler waters in the Pacific and is therefore calming down.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday at lunch or in the evening.
Precipitation precipitation from certain parts of Mexico can be severe and may pose a high risk of flooding.
“From the California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, 8 to 15 centimetres are expected, but possibly up to 25 centimetres of rainfall,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico like a tropical storm, then reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression on Tuesday morning, and then head through Arizona late Tuesday night to southern Utah.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or its remnants is very high rainfall on the California peninsula, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern US desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is believed that these rains will cause life-threatening sudden flooding, a stream of debris in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.

Hundreds of deaths due to the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims continues to rise.
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed, many of them tossed by huge waves smashing into the beach after a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves of six meters high slammed the coast after dark. Many of them swept to death and destroyed everything that happened on the road.
There was a 7.5 magnitude earthquake after the tsunami.
“When yesterday’s tsunami threat arose, people were still on the beach and not running at once, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t strike alone, he pulled back cars, logs, houses, he hit everything that was on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had flown at 800 km/h over the open sea before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees to avoid a tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
aerial photos of the agency for natural disasters showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, the curved and collapsed bridges, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the seaside city continued to be shaken by aftershocks.
Earthquake Series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) reported that the energy released by the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It has been reported that the tsunami may have intensified due to the geographical location of the city, as it is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "serious" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, later added that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said the communications networks "were completely paraly paralyzed, so no information" was received from Donggala.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross spokesman said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers were travelling to the affected areas.
It was stated that "it can already be regarded as a tragedy, but the situation could worsen."
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves arrived after a warning was issued.
In the shared social media amateur material, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building who, insane, screams about the approaching tsunami to the people below the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking buildings and cars away.
Reuters was not able to immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage, resulting in the cut-off of communication networks around Palu, and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the delivery of assistance.
The authorities reported that the army from Jakarta and other cities began to send cargo aircraft with aid supplies, but the evacuated person is still in great need of food and other basic necessities.
The City Airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
Doseba reported that when World Vision staff from Donggala traveled safely to the city of Palu, where the staff was sheltered in canvas tents set up in the backyard of the office, devastated views accompanied him along the way.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to take difficult steps to provide relief in a disaster, some people complained that foreign relief workers with a lot of experience were banned from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, provision and personnel recruited from abroad can only help when the disaster location is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Indonesia’s Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani.
“When the government says, ‘Y yes, this is a national disaster,’ we may call for international aid, but that status has not yet been announced.”
The second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing people hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would affect the gloomy history of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was pulled out of the sewer from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was crushed under the rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Indonesian national paraglider team coach Gendon Subandono had trained two missing paragliders from the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Courtesy, were his students.
"Because I am older in paraglider sport, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Gandon described in detail how within hours of the announcement of the Roa Roa hotel collapse, the news travelled around the paragliding community. He desperately sent messages using the WhatsApp app to Palu's competitors who participated in the beach festival.
However, in his messages there was only one gray, and not two blue ticks.
"I think that means that messages were not received," he said.

Trump tweeted a change on his Twitter on Saturday, tweeting: "A person formerly officially known as Kanye West West."
West, 41, has long been known as Ye, the name given to his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change began ahead of Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
The show will replace singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons," the creator said.
This is not only an abbreviation of the current professional title – West has even earlier said that this word has a religious meaning for him.

U U.S. should double funding funding for artificial intelligence
“As China is becoming more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI specialist at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various U.S. government bodies published reports about artificial intelligence, even the fact that in the U.S. there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China last year unveiled its plan to lead innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
Lee said: “Doubling our AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the U.S. and are looking forward to the next breakthrough in AI.
double-doubled funding could double the likelihood that the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence will be in the US, as Lee told CNBC this week in an interview.
Lee, whose book "Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures and has invested in Face++, one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated a top-ranking American Othello player, and later served as the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous US government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next would be to help find more insightful people.
Lee said that US scientists often have to work hard to win state grants.
"It's not China that takes away academic leaders, it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts on artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said, the China National Science Foundation funds people from academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donate money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA (D Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) announced a <0x24>2 billion investment for AI Next.
NSF is currently investing more than <0x24>100 million per year in artificial intelligence research.
However, in the coming months, nothing has been done about U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonian Macedonian people vote in referendum to change the country’s name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour claims Greek territory and vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on the proposed new name, but opponents of nationalists argue that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether voter turnout would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to take effect.
A referendum question was put on the voting card: "A referendum question on the voting card: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership after agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, it is worth the price to pay in order to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, the Macedonian youth, so that they could live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs said they would stick to the vote and make it decisive.
It would require a two-thirds majority in parliament to change the name.
The State Electoral Commission reported that until 1 p.m. there were no reports of violations.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of the electorate voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian parliamentarian Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko are voting in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country’s name to open the way to NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of the tents erected by those boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with raised heads and not to enter through the doors of the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we don’t want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, will attract much-needed investment.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that the result "Y Yes" would be "assure our future".
According to the results of a poll published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute last Monday, 30-43 percent of voters are expected to participate in the referendum – less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonia’s Macedonian TV-TV channel Telma, 57 percent of respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said that they would vote “Y Yes” 70 percent of them said yes.
50 per cent of the electorate plus one vote must be present for a successful referendum to be held.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious failure of the pro-Western government policy since it took power last May.

Scherererer wants to play a friendly game against the Rockies.
After the Nationals dropped out of the playoffs, there were no valid reasons for forcing back again.
Competing Scherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance in the play-off; they are one point ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West West.
The Rockies, who beat the Nationals 5:2 on Friday night, at least secured a chance to win a preferential pass, but will still have to make an effort to secure the right to play in the first division.

Trump speaks in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections, the president indirectly refers to the situation regarding the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have achieved will be placed on the scales in November.
There are five weeks left until the most important elections in our life.
“It’s very, very important, I don’t run... but I actually run, that’s why I fight everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Then she went on, “You see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how angry it is.
they don't care what they hurt, what they climbed over to gain power and control; that's what they really want -- power and control -- but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission "to resist and hinder."
"And you see this over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "an angry, ugly, low-minded and unjust people."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked huge ovations among the audience.

When the Momentum activists in my local party voted for my lack of confidence, I wondered if it was any surprise.
I am finally the newest of the Labour MPs who have been told that I am unwelcome - and that for having expressed my opinion.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan received similar threats from my fellow MP Joan Ryan because she stood up resolutely against anti-Semitism.
My mistrust was expressed by criticizing me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Due to the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically, on similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East East Labour meeting on Friday said: “We want to have a large number of members and productive meetings.”
For most of the eight years that I have been a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were exactly that.
It is a sad fact that today the tone of many meetings is not so at all, and that the promises of a "softer, more pleasant" policy have long since been forgotten, even if they have ever been put into practice.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that dissent in the Labour Party is not tolerated and that every opinion is judged on its acceptability by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues, whose political views, as I had previously believed, were similar to mine, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and hold opinions that I would never agree with, whether for national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what – there is a tirade of insults on social media that promotes my recall, condemns the policy of the centre, and says that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I have been much more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed to me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to endure an avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things in this political era is how insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the same party of the same views, and with every procedure of "confidence" or change in the electoral system, this party is becoming less and less.
over the last two years I have received a lot of advice in the last two years that has encouraged me not to jump out, not to speak so loud, and then "all will be fine" with me.
Vision But I didn't come into politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the Thatcher government's negligence, which literally ruined my entire school class, I have sought to obtain better public services for those who need them most, whether as a member of the local council or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including the recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East should have been surprised by my political opinions and my disagreements with current leaders in these areas.
For those of you who pushed this procedure on Friday, I can tell you that as the country digs towards Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact one message I have in Nottingham Momentum addressed to my constituents, Labour (or not): I am proud to serve you, and I promise that any threat of revocation or political expediency will not stop me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr-Melrose – 38:17 38:17 Invins Ayr Invins Ayr wins the tops of the tables
Two late attempts slightly distorted the final results, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved this moment of triumph in the spectacular, breathtaking Tennent's Premiership Day game.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one that has not been beaten.
Finally, the victory was brought to them by impeccable defense and well-exploited opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We've made all the challenges in all the games we've played so far, and we're still out of our way, so I'm really happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Ayr Ayr has done well, players have used their odds better than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which Frazier Climo successfully finished, led Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect numbers, and Baggot stopped the unsuccessful attempt.
Cllimo increased Ayr Ayr's advantage by a penalty penalty, when he scored points in the middle of the match and successfully completed his personal attempt to help Ayr break Ayr 17:5.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggott successfully completed, narrowed the gap to five points.
The match was suspended for a longer period of time due to Ruaridh Knott's severe injury and being taken off the line on a stretcher. As the match was extended, Ayr continued to push forward after Stafford McDowall's attempt was successfully completed by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card and Melrose tried to take advantage of the excess players, but Bruce Colvine's attempt was unsuccessful at the end of the fierce pressure.
The home team player came back, but after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without the ball, MacPherson pressed the ball down the penalty line for the place of the Ayr.
Climo has successfully completed his attempt, as he had done almost since the start of the rematch, after Kyle Rowe stopped David Armstrong from kicking in the corner of the field and prevented home team forward Gregor Henry from holding his fifth attempt to score points.
star star appears ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, star of the Still Game, appears ready to move into the hospitality industry after he was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, scripts and plays with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The Duet announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of this show, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.

The actor declined to comment on this fact, although sources from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was looking for a way to get involved in Glasgow's "g th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th Restaurant restaurant business."
"We Own the Sea": Bolivia, imprisoned on land, hopes that the court will again open the way to the ocean.
Sailors patrol the na navy headquarters in La Pase.
The blue flag of the ocean flutters on public buildings.
The na na na na na na na na na base from Lake Titica Lake Lake Titica Lake to the Amazon Amazon Amazonas is adorned with the m m m motto: “We rightly own the sea.
It is our duty to restore it, our duty."
Bolivia, imprisoned all over the land, is still alive with memories of access to the ocean, which had to be sacrificed to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century over resources – alive and longing once again wreathed in the Pacific Ocean.
The hopes of the last decades have been greatly strengthened as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision, which will be announced on October 1 October.
"Bolivia is united in a spirit of unity and peace and hopes of course for positive results," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will watch the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will make a positive decision on Bolivia's complaint - Chile will be obliged to negotiate access to the sea to the Bolivian state.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic Indian president, who faces a controversial election fight for re-election, is also very interested in the outcome of Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to the prospect of a return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to think that it is unlikely that the court will make a decision in favour of Bolivia – even if it does, little will change.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to cut off Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision will only be pronounced six months after the last arguments were heard is hardly an indication that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an expert on Chilean international law.
And even if Bolivia managed to make some progress, the last four years could have thrown it backwards.
Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said: "The question of access to the sea was illegally raised illegally by the present Bolivian administration.
She believes that any remnants of Chilean goodwill were destroyed by the vengeful rhetoric of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation at some point, but after all this it will be very difficult to discuss.
The country has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court’s decision was rendered with unusual speed.
“Bolivia will have a unique opportunity on Monday to start a new era of relations with Chile and to end 139 years of discord for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla has also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, and uses the sea issue as a political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The solution is an opportunity to see that we have to come to terms with the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarma nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the United
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho assures his people that they will never give up nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
The summit of Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises, which rival leaders agreed at a meeting in Singapore.
His comments came at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be resuming nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says it is a “utopian dream” that with continued sanctions and the US renouncing the declaration of the end of the Korean War, North Korea could one day be brought to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes credible disarmament action.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang does not seriously intend to give up its arsenal, which the country seems to see as the only guarantee of its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.

If you want to complement your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, this trend is just for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentrically large headgear in their spring and summer 2019 collections, and he simply stunned the audience of Paris Fashion Week with his style.
These especially impractical hats conquered the social network Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching creations on the podium.
A standout Valentine's Valentine's creation was a huge body-coloured hat, decorated with a wide, feathers-like edge that wraps the head of the dummy.
Other non-standard size accessories included jeweled watermelons, a magician’s hat and even pineapple – but they’re not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn on the lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One of the pieces looked like a diver's suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other resembled a nozzle of melted ice cream.
And if you follow this fashion trend of enormous size – you will not ask.
Style experts speculate that these huge covers can get into the shops.
Huge hats became popular with La Bomba high heels, straw hats with two feet edges were already worn by everyone - from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cult brand that has created extremely impractical hats that have conquered all social networks, has released another huge creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag, almost the same size as the model in her swimsuit.
Decoded with raffie fringe fringe and white leather handle, the Raffia bag in red brick color with raffie fringe fringe and white leather handle has become the highlight of Jacques Jacques Muso's collection La Riviera SS19 SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity sty Luke Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I think next summer will come huge hats and beach bags, because the designer has made so much impact, so it would be hard to ignore the need for custom-size accessories.”
John John Edward Edward John Edward: “Speaking languages is an essential skill for the citizens of the world”
Scottish Independent Schools have broken the academic achievement record in 2018 and once again demonstrated outstanding exam results, further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other community merits.
With more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest possible level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and to be global citizens.
As we work in the education sector, which is able to design and implement the planned school curriculum, we can see that modern languages continue to be popular and willingly choose them in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you can talk to a man in a language he understands, he will understand you with his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language in his own language, you will speak to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of the last year's exams, we can say that languages are at the peak of popularity and have the best retention ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language learners received the highest A rating.
The data collected from the 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of the students received the highest A grade in the Mandarin language exam, 72 percent of the German language learners received the highest A grade, and 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish received the highest A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland see foreign language skills as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as an elective are now considered as as important as basic subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of all the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill jobs had insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
Because the future employability will largely depend on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalising world.
No matter what career a person chooses to pursue, having a second language will in the future be far superior to others if he has these skills, which are necessary throughout his life.
By being able to communicate directly with people from abroad, a person who speaks several languages will be much more competitive.
According to a YouGov 2013 survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to be interviewed, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That's why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
By learning several languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better chances of meaningful employment.
Schools in Scotland differ from school to school according to the languages they teach.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be most important to the UK when it comes to the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the best interests of your child, there will always be a large number of languages to choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are ready to create a teaching environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to live in the future.
It is undeniable that in today's global business environment, languages remain vital for the country's future, and this must be reflected in the education system as well.
Modern languages should really really be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent Schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and outcome to Scottish youth.
It is necessary to do this.

LeBron will start his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The fans have little to wait to see LeBron James LeBron James start the season at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the Sunday season opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes it will play, it is still unclear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
James was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers in six pre-season games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump Trump's language in West Virginia, West Virginia, YouTube channel YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign tonight in Wilings, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five planned speeches next week, including stopovers in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump is seeking to mobilize support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in November.
We will have a Trump talk in West Virginia tonight and how can we watch it online?
Trump's speech in Vilinge, West Virginia, scheduled at 7 p.m. Eastern Time (East Time) Saturday, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia, West Virginia online on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to touch the topic of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week, as she sowed a lot of tension over allegations of sexual misconduct when the Senate voted to suspend the nomination for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the ultimate goal of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength ahead of the November election.
President Trump’s campaign campaign officials say the goal of the five meetings next week is to “ener volunteers and donors as Republic Republic Republicans try to defend and expand the majority that they have in the Senate and House.”
“Congress control is so high on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the campaign season begins,” said a Trump campaign spokesman who refused to reveal his name.
"Wiling's "Wesbanco Arena" tonight's speech is expected to attract Ohio and Pennsylvania sponsors and Pittsburgh media attention," the West Virginia Metro News said.
Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016 for the second time in the past month.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who according to polls is at the bottom of the ratings.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to trump him to the top of the rankings," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
2018 Ryder Cup tournament: The U.S. team is militarized and expects to qualify for Sunday Units
After three personal rounds on a Saturday afternoon, the four may be just what was needed for this Ryder Cup tournament.
This variation of success is completely fictional, but players really believe it, especially in competitions like this one.
So on whose side is success now?
“They were six points ahead, and now they are four, so I guess we can consider it a little bit of a success,” said Jordan Spieth as he prepared for the day.
Of course, Europe is in the lead, has a four-point lead, and there are twelve games to play.
American enthusiasm, according to Spieth, is faded and they don't lack it, not to mention the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four points.
Spieth was invincible from beginning to end and was flawlessly ahead.
As the round continued, the wild victories continued to be louder and louder. Thomas scored two points out of two to end the fourth match in a draw.
His blow, which won them the victory in this match at the 15th hole, was accompanied by similar shouts, which seemed to say that the American team was not in danger of the end.
"You just have to focus and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
Now each of these players has been left to play separately.
Until the successful end – 18 holes.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Strangely enough, but a charming couple from Europe scored four points out of four possible and can be calm.
Moliwood was the only couple who didn’t need additional blows not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
That course of events and the reaction of the raging viewers only confirms that they will be the players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinari, who, after the last rays of the sun set on Le Golf National, have a chance to ensure the victory of Europe.
It would be a good idea for both to succeed at the same time in different wells.
Although it is too early to speak of the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played with Sergio Garcia, the eastern four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An extra blow and two double extra blows during the first nine-hole series pushed Spaniard and Swede into trouble from which they never managed to get out.
But on Sunday, no one will get out of trouble.
It is so interesting to watch four-ball and four-ball matches because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the fact that the strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
In the final of the quarter, the U.S. team also had a fighter's backbone, which was questioned by some, especially in the states.
The last day of the Ryder Cup 10:6 European Europe is ahead 10:6
Reyder Cup Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a strong lead, leading against the United States 10:6 after Saturday Saturday 4th round 10:6.
Inspiring Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario continued to warm the atmosphere, winning two victories over struggling Tiger Woods and taking Le Golf National to the top by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side Thomas Bjorn's European side, in order to save the tro that Hazeltine had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the unsuccessful American side and finished the round 3:1-3:1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the quarters when it won two matches but failed to score a point lead.
Jim Fury’s side needs eight points from Sunday’s 12-piece match to hold the trophy in their hands.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points when Molinari and Molliwood dubbed Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four, they perfectly defeated the confidence-poor Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even better score of 5:4.
Woods, who at some point showed a high level of professionalism in two Saturday matches, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his matches in fours, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose rested in the morning fours and returned to play with his partner Henrik Stenson in the fours, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who ranked first and third in the world rankings, with a score of 2:1.
Despite a pleasant, gentle day in the south-west of Paris, not everything in Europe has gone through butter.
Triple winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raised the bar for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
In the four-ball game, they scored a tough 2:1 victory against Spain's Jonas Rahma and Ian Poulter, and in the four-ball game they beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 without hitting the ball in the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team managed to win a four-point lead in single matches, although Furyko's half would have had enough draws to keep the trophy.
Although two days were in second place, on Sunday the luck seemed to turn away from them.
North Korea says it won’t disarm its weapons unilaterally, unable to trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening their mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would certainly not unilaterally give up nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea has taken “significant measures of good will” in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test base, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we have not received a similar response from the United States," he said.
“With no confidence in the US, we cannot trust our national security, and under no circumstances will we be the first to unilaterally disarm our national security.”
While Ri repeated North Korea’s complaints about Washington’s opposition to a step-by-step approach to nuclear disarmament that would reward North Korea by step-by-step action, his statement was different in that he did not completely reject the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang used to do in the past.
Trump and Kim Jong Un made a joint statement at the first meeting between the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on "disarmament of the Korean peninsula" and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. demands nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal by coercive methods, even by rejecting the declaration of the end of war,” Ri said.
To think that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the same as for people who don’t care about chasing utopian dreams.
"But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrus."
Mr Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader stressed earlier this week at the United Nations.
The minister instead emphasised three meetings between Kim Kim Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in Moon Jae-in over the past five months: “If South Korea were South Korea and not the United States, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead dead dead dead dead dead.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech has changed dramatically compared to last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that, when “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim “Mr. Rocket Master” preparing a suicide mission, it was absolutely inevitable that North Korea’s missiles would be directed to the United States.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said there is still a long way to go and that sanctions must stay in place until North Korea meets its nuclear disarmament requirements.
Trump said on Wednesday that he has no time schedule and said “if it takes two years, or three years, or three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia said the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pomeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “Sanctions by the Security Council must be resolutely continued without any concessions until there is a complete and definitive, proven nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously approved sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri behind the scenes at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to unleash the soil for the next meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was a failure.
In July, he left Pyonyon, saying all progress had only been made so that North Korea would announce within hours hours that he had made “gangster demands.”
North Korea this month vo Moon Moon this month pledged to dis the missile base and nuclear nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim said the “appropriate measures” he sought were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the shift toward normalizing relations with Washington.
college college Harvard Harvard Harvard Harvard students learn to rest enough
New course at Harvard Harvard University this year this year encouraged all their students to sleep more to fight the growing macho culture in studios, caffeine and night awake
An academic found that at the best university in the world, students often do not even have the basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham City, a specialist in women's hospitals, has prepared a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspiration to prepare for this course he visited after talking about the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
"A girl at the end of the talk came up to me and said, "Why am I only now, in the last years of my studies?"
She said that nobody had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep habits help achieve academic and sports results and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services department, said the university had decided to offer this course after it became clear that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a photo of the dorm room, where students can click on a cup of coffee, curtains, simulators and books to learn about caffeine, the effects of light, how lack of sleep affects sports performance and how important the routine of going to bed is.
In the next section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.

“We understand that this will not change the behavior of students.
But we think they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know about the health consequences of choosing to smoke,” Professor Czeisler explained.
The culture of pride to not sleep overnight, according to him, still exists. Modern technologies and increasing pressure on students have led to the growing problem of sleep deprivation.
“To ensure that students get enough and quality sleep, should be students’ secret weapon against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, “even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep switches the brain to fasting, so students are constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare his course when he attended one of his subject courses last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course accessible to the whole campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all postgraduate students to take this course before starting to attend this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm when it’s time to go to sleep, just like when getting up, and beware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and LED lights, as they can knock your circadian rhythm out of balance, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset Gerrard's men
Dolly Mengai Livingstone managed to beat the weak Steven Gerrard 1:0, while Dolly Mengai Livingstone managed to beat the weak Steven Gerrard 1–0.
Ibrox hoped to win their first outing victory after February’s triumph with 4:1 St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as head of state, and now Gerrard’s team is eight points behind the premier League’s Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but the Rangers, who played without inspiration, saw no opportunity to level the score.
The Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston to third, and Hibernian has only one goal behind.
And the Rangers' troubles don't end there, because most likely from the tribunes a buttered object hit the side judge Calum Spence in the head and injured him.
Gerrard made four substitutions, which allowed him to overtake the Ayr and lead him to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, trusted the same monk who took a point from the Hearts last week, and he would have liked how his well-thought-out combinations locked opponents at every turn.
Rangers dominated the Rangers to control the ball, but Livingston did more with Livingston.
Scott Pittman, Scott Pittman on Allan McGregregor's goal, but the mid mid mid midfielder broke his chance by moving the ball away from the gate.
The free kick ball of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner defender Alan Lithgow begged by.
The Rangers took control of the game, but the last third of the match was only hopeful, not belief in their game.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty when he encountered Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson threw his hand at Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers only managed to shoot twice in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly frightened by Lassana Coulibaly's head blow or a gentle parade of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34-minute goal may not have matched the game, no one will argue that they deserved it for their efforts alone.
Rangers and again failed to overcome Jacobs's viscous defense.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his temper and handed it over to Menga for an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action to change Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately bore fruit when the wingman played Morelos, but Kelly, who played a spectacularly impressive game, ran to retaliate.
Livingston invited guests to play the game they loved – with long-distance passes between Lithgowo and Halketto.
Holt's team could raise their lead at the end, but McGregor defended himself against Jacobs's strike after Lithgowas was shot from the corner.
At the end of the match, Glenn Middleton once again appealed for penalty after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Pyramid Alma Almanac: In Geiger the inventor of the Geiger meter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today it's 136 years ago and MORE... That day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity. The invention that later led to the creation of a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, this device has been a hit in science and then a hit in popular culture, when the 1950 Bells of Coronado was played by the cowboys Roy Roger Rogers and Dale Evans, both Roy Roger Rogers and Dale Evans:
The Man of Prejudice: "Who the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This Geiger counter is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
And when you put these headphones on, you can actually hear how atoms in radioactive minerals touched by radioactive minerals actually work."
Dr. Evans Evans: "Hey, now it really shoots!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to exist.
New cancer vaccine can teach your immune system how to see bad cells - cancer vaccine new cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to see bad cells
New cancer vaccine can teach your immune immune system to see bad cells and kill them
vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells – this is part of the treatment
method involves extraction of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
the cells can then ‘see’ the proteins typical of many cancer cancers and then inject back
The trial vaccine has yielded promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
For one woman treated with this vaccine who teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has gone away for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory, then the cells can see the proteins typical of HER2 type cancers and then inject them back again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 HER2 promotes the growth of multiple cancers including breast, ovary, lung and rectal,” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> explained Professor Ber Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells are extracted from patients and taught to target cancer cells, has been successfully applied in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West released a tirade supporting Trump, wearing a MAGA cap, after his appearance on the SNL show.
the Good Things It's Not Over
After the frivolous show, the audience of Saturday Night Live cheered Kanye West, who praised US President Donald Trump, and said he would take part in the 2020 campaign.
That evening, after performing his third song, "Ghost Town," wearing a cap with "Make America Great," he continued to denounce Democrats and express support for Trump.
"How many times have I talked with white white people, they would say, 'How can you like Trump Trump because he's a racist?"
Well, if racism were a concern for me, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual misconduct brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn’t broadcast, West’s replication footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock tried to make a mockery of West with this recording.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the scenes because of his headgear.
"They mocked me behind the scenes.
Said not to go there with such a hat.
They made me laughed they m laughed me! they m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m
They said they said I had reached the bottom bottom," <0xE2><0x8E><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> "Washington Washington Ex Examiner."
<0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> asked he. <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> asked him. <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> I'm wearing my super superman cap, and that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
"Begin to love love."
SNL broadcasters looked ashamed, as Variety reported, and one man told the media: "There was a deadly silence in the entire studio," and the other said: "The whole studio is deadly silent."
West was called to replace singer Ariana Grande, because her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has puzzled many with his performance of the song "I Love It" in Perrier's bottle costume.
He received support from Candace Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA TPUSA, who tweeted the tweet, "To one of the bravest spirits: T T T T TUSSA: T T T T T T T T T T T T T T
But chat host Karen Hunter tweeted on Twitter that West West "was herself herself and that's amazing."
“But I choose NOT to take a man (by buying his music or his clothes or by maintaining his ‘art’) whose beliefs are a poisonous ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
opportunistic But we are also free," <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> added she.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on his Twitter account that he had changed his name and that he was now formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first creator who changed his name, but followed the same path that was already nicknamed Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg was originally called Snoop Lyon; music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.

A 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of a macho hero. He says that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Quito said he thought "something is wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of distorted masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
The other, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Throne Star Rose Rose Leslie Leslie Rose Leslie, confessed that the topic “strongly touches” him.
“I feel that I am now deeply touched by this topic. Where have we made the mistake of cultivating masculinity?” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> he asked.
"What do we teach growing men that we face such problems?"
Another thinks that television could be responsible for this wave of distorted masculinity partly because it creates very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is so taught on television or on the street or on the street, that young people are convinced that they should have this type of mas?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time – how can we change this?
It is obvious that we made a mistake with the young men and we made a mistake somewhere."
During an interview, he also confirmed that he would not take part in any pre-histor or continuation of Game Wars of Throne Wars when the series ends next summer, and stated that "he has had enough battle fields and horses."

The Emmy Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose Rose starred Igrite Igrite, the love-object of another character, John Snow Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS HIV/AIDS HIV/AIDS: China China reports 14% increase in new HIV HIV/AIDS: China China reports 14% rise in new HIV cases
China China reports that the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to representatives of health authorities, in the country more than 820 000 people were infected with the infection.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of newly infected people have passed the infection through sexual contact, and this is different from the statistics of the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But so the number of people infected with HIV has fallen to almost zero <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> said representatives of Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, over time, the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a sensitive issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because conservative values prevail in the country, 70–90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
The majority of cases of infection with this disease occur due to inadequate protective measures during such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as one of the ways to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked the data of a Republican senator, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US spokeswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had posted the personal information of three Republican US senators on Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the accusations came from ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and yet again scornful lies," Waters said on Twitter.
U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrino Hatch, both from Utah, had their home addresses and phone numbers.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill at a time when allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh were being investigated by the Senate.
The leaked information appeared a little later, when these three senators put questions to Kavanaugh.
"Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address used to determine the source of these records related to Waters's office and to disclose information about a Waters employee," <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> reported from the Capitol.
"These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these fraudulent and false suspicions is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded allegations are completely false and absolute lies, and total lies."
The statement by Waters quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This negation sounds evil," Fleischer wrote.
“It says she doesn’t have enough self-control to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of things he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not defend himself.
He should not doubt the motives of the accuser.
He should be calm and humble and humble."
Apparently, Fleischer tried to compare Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday’s hearing.
Republican nominee Omar Navarro, who ran a midterm election campaign to replace Waters, also tweeted his thoughts.
"Truth, if not a lie," he wrote.
In its statement, Waters said that its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the organizers are made clear, <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> she continued, <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> that they are legally liable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my staff without exception and to all my staff without exception.”
Come come come come "John John English English English Strikes John John At Atkinson Review Review Review - An Ex-Spee Par Parody with Row Row Row Row Row Row Atkin Atkinson
It is a tradition to look for Brexit in any British film. The same can seem to be said about the rev revival of the action spy come come come come come come come comedy franchise “John John English English” – “John English was released in 2003 and returned to the screens with the come come come comedy “John English Resurrection of John English” in 2011.
Is this sarcastic auto sarcastic sarcastic about how obviously we've obviously screwed up will become a new national export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has a second chance to bring unpleasant truths to the surface with wide eyes and a rubber face <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> after all, the name itself clearly indicates that this comedy is intended for non-English-speaking regions of the cinematographer.
Of course, this silly secret agent, who, despite his claims to luxury, has acquired some of the qualities of inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean's traits and a little bit of his resemblance to that guy, alludes to the theme of the "Cars of Fire" drama used at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It's also a bit based on the character of a traveler and a mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ad.
This latest film by Johnny English has a few beautiful moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the blade rotor crashed into his helmet.
Atkinson's comedy talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems exfoliated and strangely overloaded, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible boldly insert comedy elements.
It's as if it's more for children than for adults, and the adventurous adventures of Johnny English don't seem as inventive and as purposeful as Atkinson's quiet jokes playing Mr. Bean.
The most common topic at the moment is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has successfully hacked into Britain’s top secret spy internet network and revealed the identities of all British spies in this area, causing the agent’s outrage – the too insignificant role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop in the cup of a prime minister, a pompous and corner-drawn character who already suffers from overwhelming political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Theresa May squeezes everything she can, but in the script there is not much good material for that.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people among the retired.
It means Johnny English, who's now headmaster at some glamorous institution, but gives illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. There were a few good jokes here when the Englishman offered the School of Rock type spy academy.
Englishman is sent back to Whitehall to discuss the state of emergency, and there he meets his longtime general Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
The Bough is now already a married man, affiliated with the submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays a nobility girl, the talent seems underutilized.
So Batman and Robin, capable of messing things up in Her Majesty’s Secret Service, take action again and meet the fatal beautiful Ophelia Buletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
A charismatic billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problem, Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy, is dangerously turning his head before the prime minister.
English and Bough start their odyssey: dressed up as waiters, they start a fire in a French restaurant, cause chaos on a luxury Volta yacht and English begins a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality headphones to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All stop shots were clearly reserved for this last series, but no matter how pleasant or wild it may be, it is all reminiscent of children's television.
It's pretty mediocre.
As with other John John English English films, I couldn’t get rid of the thought: Is the British film industry in the British film industry incapable to give Row Rowan Atkinson a role that is certainly worthy of his talent?
Labour Party den denies making a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is planning to consider a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but pay a five-day wage.
It is reported that the party wants executives of companies to share the savings accumulated as a result of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, giving their employees one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend and at the same time bring home the same salary.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party’s economic agenda and plans to steer the country’s development in a worker-friendly direction.
The change to a four-day week was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to reap the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but the four-working-day week is in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first party to promote this idea; the Greens also promised during the four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this idea is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A representative of the Labour party said: "The four-four-day week is not party politics and it is not considered in the party."
Shadow Government Representative John McDonnell at last week’s Labour Party conference took the opportunity to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless dictators” and “earning hunters” in utility companies.
Such plans by the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their full share, because the Labour government may deduct something if it sees the wrong done.
It also approved plans to include employees in the company’s board of directors and to create inclusive equity funds so that 10 per cent of the capital of private sector companies would be transferred to employees and could receive dividends of up to GBP 500 per annum.
Lindsey Graham and John John Kennedy answer '60 Minutes' question: FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their opinion
In the FBI investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on whether to appoint him to the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week, and the question arises whether the facts raised by the Bureau of Investigation could affect the opinion of any Republican senators in a way that they would no longer support the judge.
Scott Pelley, a 60 Minutes correspondent, asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI might find something that will change their minds.
Senator Kennedy seems to have a looser stance than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course, of course," Kennedy said.
"As I said when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened when these accusations came up, I called him and asked, "D Did you do that that?"
He answered decisively, firmly, une un une une
Thus, Graham’s opinion does not seem to be changed by anything.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, there should be some really shocking accusations," he said.
"On Dr. Ford, I don't know what was there, but I know one thing: Brett categorically denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“Nothing she calls it can confirm it.
It has been 36 years.
I don't think there's nothing new will come out."
What is the World Citizens’ Festival and has it contributed in any way to the reduction of poverty?
The World Citizen Festival will take place this Saturday in New York City – an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and the equally impressive goal of eradicating world poverty.
For the seventh year in a row, the World Citizens Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread the message about the true goal of the event – to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival was launched in 2012 as a follow-up to the Global Project against Poverty, an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people active in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a variety of tasks or activities, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or in any other meaningful way helping to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, do the citizens of the world succeed in achieving this goal? 12 years remain before the deadline.
Will the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really convince them to demand and call for action? Maybe this is just another example of so-called Kliktivism, fictitious activism – people think that they will definitely change the situation by signing an online petition or posting on Twitter.
According to the organizers of the World Citizen Festival, since 2011, the movement has registered the actions of more than 19 million of its supporters to promote a wide variety of goals.
They claim that under pressure from these actions, world leaders have announced <0x24>37 billion in commitments and policies to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group posted 390 commitments and statements prompted by the group’s actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been disbursed or at least USD 10 billion has been raised.
According to the Group’s estimates, nearly 649 million people worldwide are already directly affected by the secured funds.
The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and promoters that aims to "help children grow up and unlock their full potential", is one of her key commitments. With more than 4,700 tweets from world citizens, she has pledged to give Rwanda US dollars to help address malnutrition in the country.
“With the support of the UK government, sponsors, national governments and people like you, citizens of the world, we can make social injustice such as malnutrition a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Nutrition Power to the London crowd at a concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after receiving 5,000 calls to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government has announced funding for the “Nutrition Power” project, which will deliver nutrition interventions to 5 million women and children.
our website in response to one of our FAQs, which asks "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?",
The citizens of the world answer: “This is a long and difficult road – sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But like the great movements for human rights and anti-apartheid, we will win because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e – these are some of the artists participating in this year’s event in New York. The event will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U U. US could use fleet block block US Navy to block Russian energy exports, says Home Home Home Home Secretary U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U Fleet Block Block Fleet to Prevent Russian Energy Exports
“If necessary, Washington may use a fleet fleet to prevent Russian energy from accessing markets, as well as markets in the Middle East,” Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
According to Zinke, Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially when it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext used to explore new energy markets.
“I think Russia is meddling in the Middle East because it wants to regulate energy, just as it is doing in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” Zinke said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to solve this issue.
“The United States can do this with the fleet, can make sure the sea routes are open and, if necessary, can blockade, make sure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke said this to participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself the "Voss of Energy Energy Consumers" in the US.
He then compared Washington’s methods with those used in dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are essentially the same.
"The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is to find more or less counterbalances to replace fuel," he said, calling Russia a country whose economy depends only on fossil fuels.
These statements came as the Trump administration was on a mission to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia on the market with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
As a result, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the alleged inappropriate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all agree that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position in the U.S. position received hostile reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its determination to continue this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I really don't support third-country interference in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president after midterm elections.
Warren confirmed at a meeting at Hollook Town Hall in Massachusetts that she would consider running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to manage our failed government, they must go to the highest office," she said in the town hall.
"After November 6 November, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential election."
During a meeting in the town hall, Warren rebuked President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm terrified at how Donald Trump treats our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticizes Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said in a tweet on Friday on Twitter that "an FBI investigation is definitely needed before the vote is definitely to be investigated by the FBI investigation."
But a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of voters in Warren's own state think she shouldn't run for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the likely voters in Massachusetts say that a senator should not run for election.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
Former Governor Deval Patrick received more support, with 38 percent supporting his possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic party representatives discussed about their possible candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says Biden will make a formal decision in January, according to Associated Press.
At Donald Trump's rally, Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic disorder.
26-year-old Track Palin, who entered the military service in September, spent a year in Iraq.
In the aftermath of the incident of domestic violence on Monday night, he was arrested and charged.
“I see what my son is going through, what he faces when he comes back into everyday life, so I understand other families who are suffering from PTSD, and the kind of injury our soldiers are getting back with,” she said at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
S. Palin Palin called his arrest "the truth the truth is avoided," she said that her son and other veterans "are coming back a little changed, they come back with a harder heart, they come back doubting whether they will receive respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other soldiers have given to their country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as preventing reports of domestic violence with guns and drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and District of Columbia support opposition to new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy to refuse asylum to refugees fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the county filed amicus curiae comments Friday in Washington, D.C., to support challenging asylum policies, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the proceedings Grace v Sessions, initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She says her partner "and members of his criminal gang" have abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was apprehended in Texas.
Grace-supporting state lawyers have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the US receives a large number of asylum applications as states plagued by constant gang violence and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "viols decades-de decades existing state, federal, federal and international laws."
“Federal law requires that decisions on asylum applications be taken on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and this prohibition violates this principle,” amicus curiae notes.
In this note, lawyers also argue that immigrant-ban policies are harming the U.S. economy, and that immigrants are more likely to do business and “pro provide employment services.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop giving asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems (or all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Da twice twice the number of victims in Palu Palu twice the number of victims has doubled the number of victims in Palu, desperate desperate desperate searches for survivors
The situation of the survivors is constantly deteriorating.
“The tension is very high,” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, as she calms her baby’s fever-stricken son, who was devastated in the evacuation centre of Palu.
“The speedboat continues to carry more and more bodies.
The lack of clean water is lacking clean water."
It has been observed that residents return to their ruined homes, collect things overloaded with water, and try to save what they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and damaged 7.5-magnitude earthquake hospitals are packed.
Some of the wounded, like Dwi Harry, who suffered from back and shoulder fractures, are placed outdoors near the Palu Army Hospital – as severe aftershocks continue, hospital patients are treated outdoors.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recounts how the hotel’s fifth-floor room, where he was staying with his wife and daughter, felt a violent earthquake.
“There was no time to save others.
I think I broke through the ruins of the wall," Harry told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, followed by silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they are healthy.”
The US ambassador accuses China of intimidating itself with propaganda advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned China Daily's paid supplement to the state's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, and accused China of trying to influence the November 6th US Congress elections. China denies this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the U.S. election marks a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China,” U.S. officials told Reuters.
Although it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising in order to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war, and both sides are battling tariffs on each other’s imports of goods.
According to Chinese and U.S. experts, Chinese counter-tariffs were targeted at exporters from Iowa and similar states that supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad – the U.S. ambassador to China, a former long-term governor of Iowa and one of the biggest exporters of agricultural products to China – said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion article published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, a daily newspaper, Branstad said that China "mocked China even more when it began to publish propaganda propaganda advertisements in our free press."
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese authorities took advantage of America’s respected freedom of speech and freedom of the press and ordered a paid advertising message, the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“ meanwhile, at the local Beijing press kiosk, you will not find contradictory voices and you will not get a real picture that reflects the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s disturbing economic trajectory, because the press is under the hard sole of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
Branstad also added that "one of China's best-known newspapers has evaded the offer to print" his article, without mentioning which newspaper it was.
analysts warn: Kavanaugh’s Kavanaugh fiasco deters Republic Republican vote voter: analysts warn mid mid election, Kavanaugh’s Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with multiple sexual harassment charges, the analyst warned that it will receive a negative response in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions of the situation are very strong, and many Republicans already officially say they want to go to the polls.
"Such things cannot be taken back later," said Grant Reeher, a professor at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, in an article published Saturday for The Hill newspaper.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute calls for an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will remember it tomorrow and November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive movement movement MoveOn.
On Friday morning protesters chanted "No November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby, when Republic Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to no Kavanaugh to Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, kipip reported Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will flow over the edges,” Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst who is impartial to the news website, told Reuters.
The people say that it was already strong, and they are right.
"But it could strengthen its position, especially among undecided women voters in the suburbs and younger 18- to 29-year-old voters who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ch.B. Ford testified in public, when she detailed the allegations of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts said that if Republicans approved the candidacy, it could cause outrage.
"This has caused a lot of confusion for the Republican Party," said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee or the final vote, not just whether Kavanaugh will be appointed as a judge, but also how the Republicans managed this situation and how they handled Ch.B. Ford,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats in the election, told the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to believe after the testimony of Kavanaugh and Ford, although it receives a little more support.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents believed or likely believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied or likely lied to testimonies, and only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Invited by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations and the testimony of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ms Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, arguing that Ms Kavanaugh had drunkenly assaulted her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party they attended while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the web-inventor plans plans to set up new internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global network, is creating a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project by this legendary inventor, is a company whose work is based on the Berners-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal is to take control of the world.
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
Solid's technology-based app allows people to create their own personal online data store (POD) – POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
As if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be available in one browser at a time.
The online shop for personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and what information can be accessed.
The company calls this the empowerment of the individual through data.
According to company CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team aren’t in touch with Facebook or Google about changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
Berners-Lee writes in a Medium report Berners-Lee said Inrupt’s “mission is to provide trading energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the durability and quality of the new Solid Solid network.”
1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technological University.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the internet neutrality debate.
Even working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I feel tremendous optimism about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Mer Mer Bernard Bernard B Van Van Van Vanbad – clerer awarded with the Victoria Cross of Victoria Cross in the First World War Victoria Cross
In honor of the 100th anniversary of the Anglican Church, the only Anglican clergyman, who was awarded the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I, was honoured in his hometown.
Colonel Lieutenant Pastor Bernard Bath won the award on September 29, 1918, during the Belenglis and Lucurs offensive.
Unfortunately, after four days, the pastor was shot dead by a sniper, so he never knew that he was awarded the highest British military award.
During the Parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, the memory stone was uncovered by two grandchildren.

Lieutenant Colonel B. Vann was shot and killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
72-year-year-old Michael Van Van Van Van Van, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather’s grandfather were “somethththing that himself himself could never be equal, but at the same time a very inspiration of hum.

MMA fans didn't go to bed all night to see Bellator 206 but had to be content with P P P P Pep Pepa
Imagine: you don’t go to bed all night to see the packed Bellator 206, but eventually you don’t get to see the main spectacle.
There were 13 battles on the San Jose poster, six of them on the main card and broadcasted live in the UK all night-night on Channel 5 Channel 5.
The British viewers were shocked at 6:00 in the morning as Gegard Mou Mouss and Rory MacDonald Rory and Rory Mou Mouss and Rory MacDonal Rory were preparing to fight, as the movie "M P Pep Pa Papa" was interrupted.
Some viewers, to put it mildly, were not impressed, because it was precisely for this fight that they did not go to sleep until the dawn.
One of the fans on Twitter called the replacement of the broadcast a children's cartoon "some kind of morbid joke."
"According to government regulations, this content is inappropriate at 6 a.m., so the children's program had to be turned on," Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said in response to the broadcast.
"Yee, "Pep the Pep."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust the timetables to take viewers in the UK into account.
"When I think of repetition, I think maybe we could probably do it," Coker said.
“But at that time it is 6 a.m., Sunday, and we wouldn’t be able to fix it until Sunday in our time, Monday in their time.
However, we are already working on this subject.
Believe me, after the change of the broadcast, a lot of messages were exchanged, not all of which were friendly.
We tried to rectify the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it is a matter of power.
I can promise you that next time it will not happen.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do. We wanted to give more to the fans, but we just didn't succeed.
This is a failed situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexual orientation.
Tom Daley, Olympic jumper to water Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he only realized in elementary school that he wasn’t the same as everyone else.
For the first time ever, Lauren Laverne, in the "Radio 4" show Desert Island Discs, said he had started talking about gay rights in public because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also claimed that it was not so important to win the Olympic Games after becoming a father.
Kirsty Young, the permanent hostess of this long-lived release, has resigned from her job for several months due to illness.
During the first Laverne show, which asked guests to imagine they were traveling to a desert island, Daley said he was growing up feeling inferior to everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said: "Up to the present day, this sense of smallness and otherness was the stimul that gave me the strength that helped me to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove himself worthwhile, so as not to disappoint those around him when they finally learn about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic bronze medals became a high-level LGBT activist and, by taking part in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Britain, took the opportunity to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had begun to speak about it publicly, because he thought he was fortunate enough to live openly without any consequences, and so he wanted to give others such hope.
The three-time World Champion said it was a surprise for him to fall in love with a man he met in 2013, Dustin Lance Black, the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
Delay said that when you survive so much when you’re so young — he was only 14 at his first Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later — it’s hard to meet someone of the same age but with the same highs and lows.
When the couple became the parents of their son Robert Ray Blacko-Daley in June, Daley’s perspective, he said, had completely changed.
"If you had listened to me last year, I would have said that the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal," he said.
But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
"Ro Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob my Olympic gold gold medal."
The name of the son of the receiver is the same as that of his grandfather Roberto, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Anto T. Daley's father didn't want to accept death, so one of his last questions was whether he had already bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, which he was going to watch while sitting in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row," Daley said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing before finally admitting that he is not invulnerable," Daley said.
After a year, the athlete competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of that my whole life – jumping into the water with the local Olympic spectators – there is no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the choice of the first song for the show – Heather Small’s song “Proud”, which responded to his feelings while preparing for the Olympics and still pleasantly horrifies the skin.
Desert Island Discs broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British Summer Time.
Form Loser Ph. Mickelson spent Saturday Ryder Cup tournament on the bench
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he will need to improve his form a lot to avoid becoming a failed anniversary.
Ph. Mickelson, who has already played his 12th time in the biennial competition, was seated on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's four-year competition.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case in the United States, five times the main winner spent part of the day on a support team, and the rest he perfected his technique on the field to correct the mistakes that prevented him from playing.
Even at the heights of his career, 48 athletes are not the ideal player on the tight Le Gold National, where a long stretch of rough grass is particularly unfavorable for inaccurate kicks.
In addition, as if the field itself weren’t terrifying enough, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson will play against Francesco Molinari, a British Open champion who has won all four matches this week with Tommy Fleetwood.
If four points behind the Americans manage to get a good start on the upcoming 12-piece matches, Mickelson's match could become absolutely decisive.
Furykas expressed confidence in his player, but he probably could not say otherwise.
“He perfectly understood the role he played today, clapped my back and hugged me with his hand and said that he was ready to play tomorrow as well,” Furykas said.
Self-confidence – He has no lack of self-confidence.
He is on the list of the most glorious athletes and has given so much to these teams both in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't know he was going to play two games.
I imagined more, but it came out like this, so we decided that we would do that.
He wants to play, just like everyone.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Fald’s record to become the most-playing athlete in a Ryder Cup match.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never reached his personal record highs.
Ph. Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, but Furyk says his presence has brought the team an intangible benefit.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to laugh at people and he’s a great guy with whom it’s fun to be in the team room,” he explained.
I think it was also fun for the younger players to compete with him this week, it was nice to look at it.
It brings much more than just a game."
Captain Captain Thomas Thomas Thomas Bjornn Bjorn knows that a large majority can quickly van
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead ahead of the last Ryder Cup unit race can easily turn into a tough fight.
The Danish athlete made his debut in 1997 in a match in Valderama, where the opposing team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only crossed the finish line with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We constantly remind ourselves that we had a big lead in Valdemara; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valdemara, where we won, but barely," said T. Bjorn (pictured), who watched the 2018 show's victory with a score of 5:3 on Friday and 10:6 on Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the team members that it is not over yet.
Tomorrow it will take all your strength.
Vision Go and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal – to try to win this prize – so we have to consistently strive for it.
“I always said, I trust the 12 players on our side, but we know who’s on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with his players' performance on a challenging field, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to pre-empt myself in any way.
Tomorrow will be a completely different matter of hair.
Tomorrow the most important thing will be an individual game – it’s something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're on the field alone, you're tested to the limit of your ability to play golf.
This idea should be introduced to the players – tomorrow they will have to squeeze everything out of themselves.
Now I'll have to separate my partner and he'll have to squeeze everything out of himself too."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk expects his opponent Jim Furyk to perform better individually than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points each.
Furyyk himself experienced both sides of the surprises of the last day, for Brookline was on the winning team until Europe had performed the miracle of Medina and made them losers."
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players to prepare for the last day.
Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but look forward to a quick start, like you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, the middle matches become very tense.
We have formed our team accordingly and released the players in a way that for us, you know...we are trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas will have the task of retaliating against Rory McIlroy in a top-level match, with Europeans leading Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"I chose these guys in this order because I think they're going to make it through the whole game," Bjorn said about his choice for the singles.
ship delivery of a new German German na na German war warship delayed again delivery delayed
The newest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to start working as early as 2014 and replace Cold War-era warships, but according to local press, it will not be seen until at least next year due to perishable systems and the massive price rise.
The commissioning of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main vessel of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was overshadowed by the problems that began to plague the already delivered ship.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the navy back in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is expected that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and certain secrecy technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance intervals, which would allow the latest frigates to travel away from their home ports for up to two years.
However, due to the endless delays, the high-tech warships, which, it is said, should allow Germany to direct military power to overseas territories, will age before they are put into service.
The failed F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Hamburg-based Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This is the first time that a ship that has already been delivered is returned to the builder by the Navy.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German press mentions some major software and hardware defects that would have made the ship useless for a military mission.
The weaknesses of the software are of particular importance, since the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of around 120 seafarers, which is half the force of the older Bremen-class frigates.
Moreover, it turned out that this ship is far too heavy, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to implement various improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the entire project – along with the perishable technical equipment, including crew training – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion).
The problems plaguing the newest frigate have become particularly significant following the recent warnings that the power of the German navy is dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German German parliament's defence chief Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the na na na "is in fact running "missable and usable ships".
The officer said that the problems had been solved over time, because the old ships had already been decommissioned, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the navy.
the National Trust is listening to the secret life of bat bats
A new study, conducted in a Scottish Highland estate, aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
Researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will be looking at dwarf bitches, soprano bitches, brown-tailed bitches and water mice that are the tallest in the Vester Ross Inverev Gardens in their research.
In certain areas of the territory, special recorders will be arranged to allow the activity of bats to be tracked throughout the season.
National Health Service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile hand-held detector tests.
An analysis of all audio recordings by experts will determine the frequency of signals emitted by the bats and the activity of one or another type.
A map of habitable habitats and a report will then be created, which will help to form a detailed picture of behavior on the scale of the entire landscape.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser to the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat maintenance, such as the creation of meadows, as well as how best to maintain wooded areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development works, which affect hatcheries and destroy residential habitats.
There is also a threat from wind turbines and lightning, as well as flycatchers, some chemicals used to process building materials, as well as hunting domestic cats.
Bats are actually not blind.
However, to catch prey during night hunting is more helped by ears than eyes.
Bats precisely determine the location of insects or obstacles in the flight trajectory by sophisticated echolocation.
NTS, responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats extremely responsibly.
Ten trained and trained experts work here to regularly carry out investigations, hat hatche inspections and sometimes rescue operations .
The organization even created the first and only special bat reserve in Scotland at Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the landlord of the manor, says that the territory of the manor is ideal for them.
"We have a great place for bats in Threave Manor," he said.
We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and great areas to live in.
But we still don't know a lot about bat bats, so working here and elsewhere here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to flour to flour."
He emphasizes that it is very important to check for the presence of bats before starting maintenance work on the territory, because accidental destruction of one hatchery can kill up to 400 females and juveniles, which can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is forbidden to kill, tease or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their hatcheries.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, urged the public to contribute to the rescue of the bats.
She said, "We still have so much to learn about our bat bats, and how many native populations of indigenous species are doing, we don't even know."
Ronaldo has rejected rape allegations as lawyers intend to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape accusations against Cristiano Ronaldo "li lie lie rape" and said people using his name "seek to become famous".
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus are accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel room.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that he then paid the alleged woman <0x24>375,000 <0x24>375,000 to silence the incident.
Speaking to 142 million followers in a live-streamed Instagram video hours hours after the charges were announced, the 33-year-old Ronaldo criticized the reports and called them "falses."
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The five-time Ballon d'Or laureate said, looking at the camera.
They want to become famous by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous, they want to say my name – that’s part of my job.
I am a happy person, all is well,” – added the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to su Der Spiegel Spiegel on charges they called "unacacacacacac " public disclosure of allegations of private space."
Christian Schertz, lawyer Christian Schertz, said the athlete would seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount of the gravest violation of personal rights, perhaps one of the most serious violations of individual rights in the past few years."
The alleged incident occurred in a Palms casino and hotel apartment in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents filed with the Nevada Clark County Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete’s room after meeting at the nightclub, where he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a "99 percent good man" who was betrayed by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo admitted that the couple had had sexual intercourse, but claimed they were contractual.
Mayorga also said Mayorga had approached police and her injuries were photographed in hospital, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she feared "fe fear of re re re and feared she would be "publicly hum de de de.'"
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel the deal as she continues to feel traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juventus with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit. The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of car manufacturers.
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK “would forever regret it” if it lost its status as the world’s car leader after Brexit.
He added he was concerned about Toyota Toyota’s UK branch to the BBC saying a no deal Brexit would temporarily stop production at Burnaston plant near Derby, Burnaston.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that a no-deal Brexit would mean a loss of jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, which manufactures Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will have to stop production in our factory,” said Toyota CEO Burnastone Marvin Cooke.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, have also voiced concerns about a no-deal exit from the EU and its implications for international trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the most worrying threat to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is up and running when needed, as parts for custom-made cars come from both UK and EU-based suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which could delay or be missing parts, according to the industry.
Toyota said the plant in Derbyshire would not be able to store more than one day’s supply and would stop production.
Theresa May’s Chequers plan for Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such border border checks.”
"We need a contract, we want to have the best contract, which, as I say I say, will not only enjoy today's success, but also take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC BBC Radio 4's "Today".
“Not only Toyota Toyota, but data from other car manufacturers show that we need to continue to benefit from a very successful supply chain system.”
Toyota could not say for how long production would be halted, but warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs in the long run.
Peter Tsouvallar Peter Tsouvallar Peter Tsouvallar, who has worked 24 years at the Burnaston plant and is responsible for Unite Unite union union meetings, said his union members were becoming increasingly worried: "I know from my experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back."
A representative of the Government said: “We have proposed a precise and credible and credible plan for future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
"As the fight for a Supreme Court Justice candidate continues, a very important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week," the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, Trump’s ties to Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller’s independence, has fuelled rumours in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the wearing of a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of using the 25th Amendment to remove the president.
Rosenstein denied this report. Rosenstein denied it.
Still, flashing with resignation announcements, he went to the White House last Monday.
The meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations in New York, will take place Thursday.
Mr Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein. The meeting was later postponed in order not to coincide with the Senate Jud Judiciary Committee hearing, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh’s allegations within a week, again postponing the vote in the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's spokeswoman, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “Its date is not fixed. It may take place this week, but given all the events surrounding the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
We'll see. I always like to press the press to keep the news."
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: Sanders hasn’t held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, Moderator, asked why.
Sanders replied that press conferences are rarely rarely held because they don’t like TV reporters with “viewer effects” but added: “I have to accept the fact that they are looking for effects for viewers.”
Then he suggested that Trump would communicate more often with the press directly.
"The president answers questions more often than any previous president," she said, without providing any evidence, adding, "We have reviewed these statistics."
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We've tried this a lot of times over the last few weeks, and you've seen it many times over the last few weeks, and press conferences will be replaced by your direct communication with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions while leaving the White House, attending public hearings or press conferences with honorable guests.
One-person press conferences are rare.
The President's free and sometimes bizarre appearance before journalists this week in New York City may have explained why.

Emergency surgery on Christion Abercrombie who has a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a defender of the Tennessee State Tigers who suffered a head injury, lost the game to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday at 31:27, according to Mike Organ, a Tennessean journalist.
Tennessee State Chief Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the side line and it just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medics at the side line Abercrombie gave to breathe oxygen, then laid it on a stretcher and sent it for further research.
Tennessee State officer Chris Harris from Nashville, Tennessee, told WSMV that Abercrombie’s operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was completed.
Harris added that "there is no information yet about the type and extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-years-old who has officially spent the sporting season in Abercrombie, has moved from Illinois and plays his first season with Tennessee State.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he rebounded five balls on Saturday, and the total number of rebounds he rebounded in the season has reached 18.
higher stamp stamp tax for foreign foreign buyers buying UK UK real UK real property will have to pay higher stamp stamp tax
foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp tax and the extra money will be used to help homeless people
Corbyn’s successful Corbyn campaign to attract young voters will reduce the risk posed by the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
UK non-tax-payers will be subject to increased stamp stamp stamp tax UK tax
the Ministry of Finance Ministry of Finance expects to be able to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers of UK real estate will be subject to a higher stamp tax and will use the extra money received to help homeless people
By promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners, this step is expected to reduce the risk posed by Jeremy Corbyn’s successful campaign to attract young voters.
the increased stamp duty will be levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay UK taxes, and the additional money received will be used to promote the government’s campaign against homelessness.
Additional toll – paid in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for buying a second home or house for rent – can reach as much as three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that this step will allow to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3> 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built real estate is bought by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it more difficult for first-time home buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, so many rich neighborhoods of the country and especially the capital city have become ghost towns.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in court fees to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused big construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by quickly buying up land but not using it, and urged May to address Britain’s housing shame by scrapping quotas on affordable homes.
Corbyn announced some eye-catching housing reforms, including rent controls and a no-fault removal ban.
In addition, he wants to give more power to the municipal councils to build new houses.
May said: "I said last year that as prime minister I would strive to bring back the British dream - every new generation must have a better life.
Which means that we need to fix our disturbed housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
It is, however, wrong that non-UK residents and foreign-based businesses can buy houses as easily as hard-working British citizens.
For so many people the dream of a home has become almost impossible to achieve, and the threat of homelessness hum hum humiliation is still far too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland’s Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland’s national team leader.
The 42-year-old Scots love the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the first league and three points behind the club in first place.
After taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championships last season, this summer he moved to the Stadium of Light.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I'm in B and that's the end of it," Ross told the BBC's Scotland's Sportsound.
"But when I was a kid, I grew up at Hamden Stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish national games, and that always drew me back.
It's true, this opportunity will only happen if I lead the club successfully."
By Ross Sunderland was led by Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, the former Alloa Athletic CEO says he didn't feel anxious about starting a job after such prominent executives in such a big club.
"My success will now be judged on the answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Premier League?"
"According to its structure and conditions, this club is undoubtedly a member of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I'll think that I've been a good job here when I'll probably return the club back to the league."
Ross's managerial career lasts only three years. Before that, he worked as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and replaced Hearts coaches for 15 months.
He later helped Alloa to rebound to the third division, and made St Mirren the next season champions of the championship.
Ross says he is now more satisfied than he ever felt in his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"This change must have been radical," <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> he recalls his leadership of Alloa.
“I honestly believed that it’s better for me to lead than to play.
It sounds strange, because I was lucky, I earned a lot of money and I was happy with the satisfactory achievements.
Targeting Any play can be difficult.
Every week has to overcome a lot of problems.
And now it is not easy – work stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. As an adult I always felt I was on my sled, but leadership gives me the most satisfaction."

The summer heatwave has boosted the incomes of poor British pubs, but has made it even more burdensome for restaurant chains.
The figures showed that in July, sales of groups of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants, revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from CGA, the business consulting firm that compiled the data, said: “The unending sunshine and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that the same trends continued in July as in June, when pub revenues grew by 2.8 per cent. However, restaurants suffered even more than before.
Health in restaurants trade in restaurants fell by 1.8 per cent in June, and in July the situation became even worse.
pubs and pubs, which receive the main income from the sale of beverages, undeniably had the best results, and the sales of pubs and bars grew stronger than the decrease in restaurants.
Although not as bad as restaurant companies, pubs, which receive the main income from the food trade, were also hit by the sunshine.
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In well-run pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food sales fell by 3 percent."
Paul Newman of RSM, a leisure and hospitality sector analysis firm, said: “These results continue the trend seen since late April.
When it comes to caterers, the weather and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be key factors.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle. True, a 4.8 per cent drop in sales will be particularly painful over the years, as it will contribute to the continued cost pressure.
a longer hot summer could not have come at a worse time. Time will tell whether milder temperatures, felt milder temperatures in August, will provide a much-needed rest."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new venues, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the development of brand-owned networks.

One in five children -- some just 11 years old -- create secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that the number of fake Insta pages is growing rapidly, a link to the photo-sharing site Instagram.

Twenty percent of the students said they used a censored main account to show parents, but they also had secret accounts.
A mother accidentally finds a secret secret website of a 13-year--old daughter, finds that a teenage girl insists: "R rape me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (CIA) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old schoolchildren had two accounts, and half of those said they had hidden accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of the MDK, Mike Buchanan, said: “The fact that so many teenagers give in to the temptation to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them is alarming.”

breast breast breast pump advertising, where mothers are compared with cow cows, received different ratings online online
The company, which makes breast pumps, has received different opinions about its advertising, which compares nursing mothers with dairy cows.
To mark the launch of a product described as the world’s first silent portable breast lift, consumer technology company Elvie has launched a promotion inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new breast pump gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers in a hir full of Hayne, four real mothers dance according to a sound recording, in which, for example, they can hear the words: "Yes, I milk myself, but I see no tail tail" and "If you have not noticed, this is not the ud, this is my breasts."
In the Appendix continues: "T pull it out, pull it out, pull it out, I feed the babies, pull it out, pull it out, pull it out, I milk my hand-beauty."
However, the advert posted on the company's Facebook page sparked an online controversy.
The video, which was viewed 77 000 times and received several hundred comments, reacted in different ways. Many said that it overlooked the horrors of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to promote this product is a very poor solution.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their newborns are taken away from them a few days after giving birth," one woman wrote.

Another commented: “It is understandable that this traumatizes both the mother and the newborn.
But why don't you use them for an ad that introduces a breast pump for mothers who don't take their babies?"
Something else else added: “Ad advertising is a total misunderstanding.”
She defended the advertisement of the other commentator – one of the women admitted that the song seemed “very fun” to her.
“I think the idea is genius.
I would have bought it if I was still feeding.
When I cut off the milk, I felt just like a cow.
The advert is a little crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.

Another commented: “This fun ad is for mothers who milk out (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to praise or to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that all of them were shocked with inconspicuous breast pumps in their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
Still, the Elvie breast pump does not emit any sound, has no wires or tubes and fits seamlessly in the nursing bra, so that women can move freely, hold their babies or even leave the house when they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and executive creative director, said: “The Elvie breast pump is a revolutionary product that deserves to be marketed boldly and provocatively.
When we compared nursing women to dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the issue of milk termination and all the challenges it poses, while having fun and as much as possible demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie breast pump has entered the headlines of the press.
During London Fashion Week, in the collection of designer Martha Jakubowski, the mother of two demonstrated this product on the catwalk.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border per month has remained broadly unchanged, but the number of migrant children in detention has increased significantly, partly because the Trump administration’s tough rhetoric and policies have made it more difficult to accommodate them with guardians.
Traditionally, the majority of guardians themselves were immigrants without papers and feared that by applying for child custody they risked the possibility of staying in the country.
As the federal government announced in June that potential carers and other adult members of their families will have to provide fingerprint fingerprints and this data will be shared with immigration authorities, the risk has increased further.
Last week Matthew Albence, chief officer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the institution had detained several dozen people who had sought custody of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“Nearly 80 percent of these persons – guardians or members of their families – reside illegally in the country, and the majority of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to persecute these persons," Albence said.
According to the employees of the shelter, in order to consider cases of children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules. According to them, some children must appear in court within a month of their detention, and not within 60 days, as it was customary in the past.
Many will try to defend their request for legal status before an immigration judge, not by arriving in person, but by video conference call.
The deportees, who have been declared ineligible, will be deported in a short time.
According to the staff of the shelter and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Defenders say this is even more alarming in large institutions such as the Tornill Shelter: because of their size, they increase the chances of overlooking signs that a child is suffering.
They added that moving children to a tent village without enough time to emotionally prepare them or to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma many had suffered.

In addition, addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces on Syrian soil under the pretext of counter-terrorism were illegal and would be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem said that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have fled their homes since 2011, the war on terror was almost over.
“Damascus will not stop fighting this holy struggle until we have eradicated both terrorist groups and any illegally staying foreigners in all areas of Syria.
There are some 2,000 US troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-ravaged country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem said the conditions for their return are good. At the same time, he accused some Western countries of spreading unfounded fears that discourage refugees from returning.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return back," he said.
“They politize what should be a purely humanitarian humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will only receive reconstruction aid if Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created the conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces targeting a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed hope that the military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which will be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a committee composed of members of the government and opposition to prepare the draft Syrian post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions under which the Syrian government will participate in the committee – the work of the group should be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why will Trump Trump be elected for a second term Why will Trump be elected for a second term?
According to this logic, in 2020, Trump would be elected unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, his presidency would end prematurely with impeachment and scandal.
Without no doubt doubt, it would be the most dramatic end of the presidency, the most dramatic end of any presidency ever!

In the tight mid-term mid-term elections to the House of Representatives in the House of Representatives, money is pouring money from around
It is not surprising that the reorganization of congressional constituencies, which resulted in two members of the House of Representatives attempting to win the same position, flooded Pennsylvania's 17th constituency with money.
The newly redrawn Pittsburgh County has included Democrat Conor Lamb, a member of the House of Representatives, in March, winning his seat in a special election in a different district last spring.
The Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, competes with the Republican Keith Rothfuss, a new 17th in the House of Representatives.
Maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that, in violation of the Constitution, the old counties were falsified in favor of Republicans.
During the election March in the new 17th constituency, the main party financial institutions – the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DKCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NPC) – ran into campaign finance.
Lamb gained fame in Pennsylvania when he narrowly won the high-profile March special election in the 18th congressional district by a narrow majority.
Republicans took the place for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Political connoisseurs gave Democrats a bit of an advantage.
the United States considered to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but then calmed
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, but did not receive a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama before the partners moved the Trump Organization leadership.
“Due to recent decisions to withdraw recognition, Taiwan State Department officials have decided to recall heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
The sanctions are being considered only for El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately <0x24>140 million in American aid, as well as drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, which would include a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions for specific individuals, would have been painful for a Central American country with high levels of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as an important step forward in preventing migrants from migrating to the United States.
But in mid-September, the highest officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and so basically ended any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
“In order to show the importance the administration attaches to this gathering, Vice President Mike Pence is now on the speaker list for the conference scheduled for mid-October,” the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without warning of any reprimands or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesperson refused to comment to Bolton on the details of the discussion, which were told by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an outsider analyst close to the administration, who also spoke, if his anonymity is preserved.

Next, it is inevitable to wait for the report of special adviser Robert Mueller about the possible obstruction of justice by Trump – his very solid evidence is now available in public archives.
Furthermore, Mueller is reportedly turning his investigation to the question of whether the Trump campaign was conducted in secret cooperation with Russia, which is undermining our elections.
If Congress were to shift hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution—at the same time as he prepares to stand up again against the electorate, and perhaps, finally, against the commission of officials.
There's a lot of "if" here and I'm not saying that the end of Trump is inevitable -- just like the end of Trump's European counterparts.

History unfolds around such fundamental turning points – then the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or paused.
Now the Americans have found themselves at several such fundamental turning points.
What will we do if Trump diss Rod Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the fate of Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein's troubles began when this newspaper reported that last year an official had offered to record the president secretly and considered his unfitness for office.
Rosenstein argues that the story in The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the FBI’s new FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh’s Kavanaugh proves incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, Brett Kavanaugh is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And, finally, in the mid term election, will we vote for Congress, which will force Trump to take responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy is in danger of a long winter.

Graham Dorrrrans Graham Dorrrrans of the Rangers against Rapid Rapid Vienna Vienna looks optimistic
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that if they win a spectacular match against the Austrians against Villarreal earlier this month in Spain, they could be in a strong position to leave Group G.
midfielder Graham Dorrans could only make his first appearance this season in a 2:2 finish against Villarreal due to a midfield injury, but he hopes the Rangers can use this score as a springboard for more important goals.
"We had a good result because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old.
“We started playing with the belief that we would achieve something, and we ended with something achieved.
Maybe we could have been more focused at the end, but overall the competition wasn’t bad.
They probably played better in the first half, and we pulled in the second half and showed who we were the better team.
Thursday will be another significant European League night.
I hope that we can get three points. The game will be tough, because in the last competitions their result was excellent. But I have no doubt that with the support of the audience, we can get ahead and achieve a good result.
Last year was really hard – both what happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood there.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the training is great.
"I hope we can get ahead ahead, forget last season and play a good game."

Although the respondents clearly imagined what kind of care they would like to receive, few of them talked about it with family members.
Nearly half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member but don’t try to talk about it,” Holly Snyder, vice president of nationwide life insurance, said.
This is where you need to start.

earthquake and tsun disaster earthquake and ts
“At least 384 were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday,” officials said in a statement.
Due to the destruction of communications, the emergency services did not have access to any data from the Donggal Regency, an area north of Palu, close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palu following a disaster.
Here are some of the most important facts about Palu and Donggal on the island of Sulawesi.
With a population of about 379,800 in 2017, Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the earthquake struck and the tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency stretching along the coast of Sulawesi Island in the northwest of Sulawesi Island, more than 300 km (180 miles) long.
Regentica, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population of around 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic pillars of the central province of Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, although it is mainly concentrated in Moroval on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the last century.
In 1938, the tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, a tsunami hit the western city of Donggal in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia, located on the seismic-active ring of fire in the Pacific, is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a strong quake on the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia triggered a tsunami in northern Sumatra that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several strong quakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April 2005.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near it.
A 6.8 magnitude quake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a magnitude 7.6 quake struck an area near Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
In 2010, a 7.5 magnitude quake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters in length that wiped out dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
The Regency of Pydiye Jaya in Aceh was devastated and panicked as people remembered how everything was devastated after the terrible earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
Strong quakes shook the Indonesian tourist-visited island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the coast.
Saraha Palin's el el Saraha Palin's el Saraha Palin's son arrested on charges of domestic violence
On charges of assault, Track Palin, the eldest son of Saraha Palin, a former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate, has been arrested.
A report by Alaskan police released on Saturday found that 29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and resistance in detention.
According to a police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took away her phone.
As reported by KTUU, Palin was returned to pre-trial detention in Mat-Su Pre-trial Detention and released for <0x24>500 bail.
"On Saturday, he appeared in court, where, when asked to justify himself, he claimed that he was completely innocent," the network said.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, meaning he can be jailed for up to one year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, a day in prison and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the suspected assault.
The case is currently being considered by the Alaska Veterans Court.
Related to this incident, he was charged in January 2016 with assaulting his home, preventing him from reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend said that he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for linking her son’s cruel behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) caused by his service in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after Friday's tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of the tsunami strike are being shared on social media.
The Tsunami hit the coast when hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in Palu.
Federal prosecutors federal prosecutors in New New New New York seek rarely-used death penalty for suspected suspect in terror terror attack
federal prosecutors in New York seek the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been executed for federal crimes in this state since 1953.
30-year-old Saipov is suspected of renting a truck from Home Depot on October 31 and carrying out an attack on a bicycle path along a western highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists while driving along the path.
According to the announcement of the intention to seek the death penalty in the southern county of New York, prosecutors to justify the sentence will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily injuries.
According to a court document, both of these accused points can result in the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury of Appellants issued a 22-point indictment to Saipov, covering eight charges of murder involving extortion (typically by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases) and of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say that the attack was very well planned and premeditated, and the way Saipov executed it called disgusting, cruel and immoral.
"As a result of the actions of Sayfull Habibullaevich Saipov, members and friends of the following families were injured, injured and lost loved ones: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveso, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darreno Drake, Ariel Erlijo, Hernano Ferruchio, Hernano Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Deleamimus".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case involving the death penalty was heard in the Southern District of New York a decade ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution was in 1953 in a New York federal case against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two years after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Abbi Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek national, did not regret his actions either immediately after the attack or several months later.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack by videos of the Islamic State (ISIS) that he watched on his phone.
Police reported that he also asked to hang the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital ward.
He did not admit his guilt in accordance with the 22 points of the charge.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal state-funded federal defenders, said they were obviously disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of pleading guilty and serving a life sentence without an opportunity to be released will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says the responsibility for Brexit negotiations should lie with NIGEL FARAGE<0xCA><0xBC>AS.
Nigel Farage pledged to mobilize the nation's army during a protest at the Tory conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the heat of Euroscepticism, and one of Theresa May's party MPs suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have left if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the difficulties May faces in trying to unite the divided pro-EU ranks have been revealed by EU-backed Tories who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to deliver on her Chequers-agreed compromise plan when she is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostile reaction and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone at the Leave Means Leave Solihale rally said he wanted to thwart Chequers' plan.
He argued that Farage should have been an equal partner and should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had led, we would have already left the EU," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers’ plan.”
expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to obey others.
in our country we want to pass our laws.”
Bone denied any suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstrators and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it. It is also unpopular among members of our party and activists who take to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Stop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a critical critical statement to May May, May added: “Pri Prime Prime Prime Prime Minister will keep his office as long as he keeps his promises.
Farage said that politicians must be forced to feel the heat if they betray a decision made in a 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a question of confidence for us, for the nation and for our political class," he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit Brexit, so today we’re here to tell them we’re not going to let them get away by doing that.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which has almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
Mobilize the army of the nation of this country, which has brought us the victory of Brexit Brexit, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-go and proud the United Kingdom.”
And Brexit opponents marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
When the Group formed this weekend, a group of activists waved posters with the slogans “Tories against Brexit”.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they had faced because of the party's gadget at the start of the conference.
“These are people who say they can deploy IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus plus plus plus plus, frictionless borders and free trade without borders with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a total farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to world champion title when team orders him to give victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Walter Bott defeated Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying race on Saturday, it became immediately clear that Mercedes' instructions would be crucial in the race.
Starting in the first place, Bott made a great start and, defending his position in the first two turns, almost left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter a two-part garage, left Hamilton, and he returned to the race in the tail of the group, so it was fatal.
Mercedes entered the two-part garage behind the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after almost contactless action, took the lead when the Ferrari driver, after a double manoeuvre to maintain his position in the third turn, was reluctant to loosen the inner side of the track.
Max Verstappen, who celebrates his 21st birthday, started from the back of the line, but at the end of the first lap he was already seventh.
He was the fastest for most of the race, as he drove without changing tires to be as fast as possible in the finish, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and finish fourth.
Finally, in lap 44, he turned to the two-partition garage, but in the remaining eight laps he was unable to raise the pace and Raikkonen crossed the finish line fourth.
“It was a difficult day for Valtteri because he had a great weekend and when he was asked to skip me, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team did a great job and won the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was really poor body language it was really bad body language
US President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a meeting with people on Saturday over her stubborn denial of the leak of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, which accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting.
In a speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly name Ford's testimony to the Senate Law Committee, but said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are unholy, indecent and unjust.
“What could have happened and is actually happening in the Senate in recent days, when you see anger, when you see people are angry, wicked, obscene and unjust,” he said.
"When you see official statements and leaks, and then you say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I haven't done it."

Dianne Dianne Dianne Feinsteinstein, are you leaking?
You remember her answer to the question, did she leak the document? “Oh, oh, oh, what?
Definitely not.
I have not leaked."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added, depicting the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh, which was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from her office.
Feinstein told the Feinstein committee, according to The Hill, according to The Hill, to Feinstein told the committee: "I did not hide the accusations of Dr. Ford Ford and I have not leaked her history."
"She asked to keep it secret, and I did as she asked."
But the president, during a meeting with people on Saturday night Saturday night, he said, "You know, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't leak, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
As he continued to defend a candidate for Supreme Court Justice, accused of illegal sexual behavior by three women, the president said the Democrats had used the accusations to their advantage.
“They are determined to regain power by any necessary means.
You see meanness, indecency; they don't care what they hurt or what they have to go over to get power and control," the president's speech was quoted as saying.

The analyst analyst laid out the sequence of the events that occurred during the night when the woman was burned alive alive
The prosecutor's office set out the facts available in a repeat case on Saturday against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as forensic expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to bring together the movement of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, the accused, and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, a victim who died on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that indicated Tellis was with Chamber on the evening of her death, which contradicts previous statements.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
Sanford expressed his position on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tell Tell Tell told the truth that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "lie because his truck was in Nashville Nashville."
Another difference was that Tellie claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks after Chambers died.
Mobile phone records show that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tell had deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
It is expected that the defense will begin to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would be referred to the jury later on the same day.

New York nanny-nanny sued a couple after she was fired from her job for "racist"
a New York n a New York n Babysitter sued a New York n a couple for being dismissed for discrimination, after receiving a wrong message from a mother complaining that she was "another black black black" at the wrong address.
The couple deny that they are racists and deny racists and called the claim "rap rape".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was upset when she learned that Giselle Maurice, the new baby baby-sitter Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEE, NONE MORE BLACK”, Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
It was sent twice, however, not to her husband, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized that she had acted carelessly, she felt uncomfortable and dismissed Ms. Maurice, arguing that the previous babysitter, who was an African-American, had done her job badly and was hoping to have a Filipino instead.
Maurice was paid for one working day and she was sent home in an Uber Uber car.
Maurice now sued the couple for compensation for dismissal and seeks to pay as much as <0x24>350 a day for living and working at the client’s home for half a year, for which she was initially hired even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them that such things can't be done," she told Post on Friday Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by denying it and arguing that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice because they feared they would not be able to trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasc told the Post Post.
“Wo would you entrust your children to someone to whom you were impolite, even though it was a mistake?
Your own newborn newborn baby???
dothorororormanmandododo not think."
Plasc, who e e e e e e e e e e e "rape" Plasc said Plasc said his wife had had a baby just two months two months ago and was "in a very difficult situation".
Are you going to judge for that?
This is not very nice behavior," added the investment banking specialist.
While the case is being tried, the media hastened to condemn the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the talking bear.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel at the place of someone else reading the book for the first time before it’s published.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about the enormous success of Pad."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before discovering the inspiration to write a book for children about a plush teddy bear, would not have been too upset if his work had been rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book after the death of his father was pleasant and at the same time sad a year later.
Speaking of Paddington, which she describes as a "very important member of the family," she added that the father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was quite a quiet man and didn't like to brag," she said.
“Because Paddington was so much like himself, he felt as if he had a child who had achieved something: you are proud of him, even though this is not your job.
I think he had a similar view of Paddington's success story.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always dedicated his merits to Paddington himself.
my daughter was dying dying my daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors never managed to save her life.
"Nad constantly called and said that the condition was really bad, she is not expected to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I received a call from Nado, who called to tell her that she had two minutes to live and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I told her, “Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
Medications given by doctors, which supported her heartbeat, slowly ceased to function and was eliminated from the body.
She died a little ahead of time and that was the end of it all.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not howl, scream or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I should have kept it in myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning her dead daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers unaware of the hardship she must face.
"Nobody knew," she said.
“My head was lowered and tears were shed all the time.
It's hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt so sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
The m mourted women postcards are intended to prevent suicide suicide on bridges and bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones by suicide try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh Bridge distribute postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and seek help.
Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want a single parent to feel the way I have to feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up the room."
However, he gave up his work before his death, for he was "in a very dark place, in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother Tyler, who was 11 at the time, found his suicidal brother.
Davis said: “I fear a chain chain reaction could happen all the time.”
Mr. Davis created postcards “so that people know that there are people around you who can be approached and talked to, even if it’s a friend.
"Sit not in silence, you must speak."
Mr. Humphreys, a long-time friend of Mr. Davies, has lost his 15-year-old partner, Mark, who resigned shortly after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he was depressed, depressed and didn't complain," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
The Christmas Christmas was a very bad situation: when the children rolled out their presents, he did not look them in the eyes and did not react in any way."
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: “It left a void in the family.
It breaks our heart.
However, we must all continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance when the FBI begins investigation Brett Kavanaugh's Kavanaugh's
I thought if we could actually get what he asked for -- a limited investigation of a limited duration and scope -- we might be able to bring some unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" under the strong clutches of supporters.
Why did Mr Ka Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters and Republican supporters not want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their contradiction is determined solely by time.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to fail, their efforts to elect the person they want to elect to the nation’s highest court will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators in an effort to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, formerly Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI releases its FBI report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can receive 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cut ties and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean deserters has "redredred" since Kim Kim Kim comes to power
The South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea had fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Un Un Unification Ministry, said that 1,127 deserters were identified last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were tightening controls at the North Korean-Chinese border and increased prices of human smuggling.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
Many North Korean deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved noticeably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered in the middle of stalled talks on denuclearisation.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in June in Singapore, when both agreed in principle to work towards a nuclear-weapon-free zone on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of keeping its sanctions unchanged.
“If there is no confidence in the US, we cannot trust our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally,” Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri Ri “will not be the first to disarm unilaterally,
Nancy Pelosi Brett Kavanaugh Kavanaugh calls Kavanaugh "hysteric" and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made those remarks in an interview she gave Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman did this, she would be said to be hysterical,” Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault against Dr Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his introductory talk about the family and high school, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes starting to cry or cry.
He also utterly denounced the charges against him, calling the “grotesque and coordinated destruction of reputation” that was organized by liberals outraged by Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he could not work for the Supreme Court because he revealed his biased view of Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and attack from the Clinton and Democratic Party," she said.
When asked if she would seek to oust Kavanaugh if his candidacy was confirmed and the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
“I’ll say yes if he’s lying to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit to serve not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court he’s working for now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Healthcare Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he was considered a conservative judge.
Mr Kavanaugh evaded questions whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court rulings or not.
“Now is not the time to say, hysterically, when a biased personality has become a judge, ‘How wonderful!’” Pelosi said.

This is a legitimate criticism – finally months and even years of accumulated wrath, which she cannot express without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," 45 years later, Miss Steinem told me.
"It doesn't seem unusual to me, and what do you?"
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman, the manager of a company, who told me that she also cries when she gets angry, but she developed a method: when she got angry and started to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to at the time: “You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm really angry I'm really angry."
And she just kept crying.
“It seemed brilliant to me that it was genial.”
tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is from one of my first jobs in the office, where mostly men worked and where once I started to cry because of the unspeakable rage. Then I was grabbed by the neckline by an older woman, a harsh manager, whom I always feared a little bit, and dragged to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you weeping,” he said to me.
They don’t know that you are angry.
to them it seems to them that you are sad, so they will rejoice that they have overcome you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democratic Party Congresswoman, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught by an adulterer on board the Monkey Business and withdrew his candidacy, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to run for president on his own.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing after 30 years.
There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for another.
Somebody called me "Snow Snow Snow with seven dzz-s seven."
Late in the campaign, there was little time left to raise funds, so she swore she would not announce her candidacy until she raised <0x24>2 million.
It was an uneven struggle.
She noticed that some sponsors who donated <0x24>1,000 to men only donated <0x24>250 to her.
"Did they think I was getting a discount?" she asked.
When she gave a speech in which she announced that she was launching a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions – people who supported gratitude, a system of frustration that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and directly reach voters rather than representatives, and anger at sexism – that she wept.
"You would have thought I was nervous," Schroeder recalled the reaction of the press to her speech.
You would have thought that I was supported by Kleenex Wipes business.
I remember, I wondered what would be written in my tombstone.
"She was crying?"
How US-China trade generations of US-China trade between China and US trade generations may benefit Beijing Beijing Beijing
The first salves of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say that discord could eventually benefit Beijing.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year after imposing duties on key Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The sharpest confrontation occurred this week, when new tariffs on goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) came into force, effectively taxing half of China’s US exports.
Beijing responded to all the measures in the same way – with the latest decision, it imposed a five to ten percent tariff on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has sworn an oath to fight the U.S. tooth for tooth, and it seems that this second-largest market in the world is definitely not going to come down in the near future.
Washington would ease sanctions only if China obeyed the demands, but publicly bow to the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its party properly, the difficulties of a trade war with the US could eventually have a positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence between the two markets.
“The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could cause the economies of both countries to crash is actually far more dangerous than observers have hitherto acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at Asia’s Center for New American Security Institute.
Syrian Foreign Minister Says Syrian Foreign Minister Says Syrian Foreign Minister Says Syria Ready to Accept Returning Refugees
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Walid al al-Moualem, Foreign Minister of Foreign Minister, Walid al al-Moualem, told the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
"For progress in the fight against terrorism has made the situation on the territory much more stable and more secure," he said.
The authorities continue their efforts to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists and to restore the situation to normal.
All the conditions are already in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave as a result of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against everyday life and well-being.
According to UN estimates, 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem Al-Moualem said the Syrian Syrian regime would be happy to accept help to rebuild the country.
However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.

"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods - I grew up watching him play," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This is a bizarre statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 of the biggest prizes and landed only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the drive lawn over the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level game throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk, Captain Jim Furyk, after the team's disappointing performance, said: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning there was a certain moment when we started to put pressure on the Europeans.
We have been fighting.
Wearing a hat against Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
It is necessary to bend down the head.
Our opponents were superior over our opponents."
