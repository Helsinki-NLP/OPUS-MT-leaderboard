Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they "look like dolls"
Some members of the Assembly were appalled at the proposal to change their name to MWP (Welsh MP).
This concerns the intention to change the Assembly's name to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule at the political level.
A member of the Labour Assembly said his group was concerned "that this is rhymed with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Wales readers: In Welsh, twp means "fool" and pwp means "cock".
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the group as a whole was "unsatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that it was a shortening of the word from MWP to "doll".
The Welsh letter w is pronounced in a similar way to the Yorkshire English word u.
The Assembly's commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change the name, said: "The final decision on the names of all members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
In 2017, the Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that received strong support for naming the Assembly the Parliament of Wales.
As regards the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission gave preference to Members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP received the greatest support during the public consultation.
Members of the assembly are obviously proposing alternatives, but the efforts to reach an agreement could be a headache for the Presidency's official, Elin Jones, who is expected to table legislative proposals for amendments in a few weeks' time.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of a member of the Assembly and the plan of the committee system.
During the debate on legislation, the members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on the issue of how they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote was held to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province of its own called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, speaking against the plebiscite over the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
During the hardships of Harlem, the bells of St. Martin and other churches fell silent
“The old people I talked to said that historically, you could find a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
You won’t find one or the other today.”
He said it was understandable why the bars disappeared.
“People talk differently these days,” he said.
“Bars are no longer a neighborhood site where people gather all the time.”
Speaking of churches, he worries that the money from the sale will not last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they’ll come back to where they started.”
He added that churches could be replaced with multi-apartment apartments with cooperative apartments that would house people who would not help the remaining shrines.
"Most of the people who will buy cooperative apartments in these multi-apartment buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore speed up the moment the churches close completely because it is unlikely that most of these people who have moved into these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built in 1870 by the White Congregations, before Harlem became a black metropolitan community, and St. Martin's Church was built a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation emerged in the 1930s.
The Congregation of the Blacks, which held services nearby, took over the name of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by the Congregation of Blacks with cleric John Howard Johnson, who led a retail boycott on 125th Street, the main store in Harlem that refused to hire or appoint blacks to higher positions.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but as the parishioners of the spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
Clergyman David Johnson, the son of spiritual father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon the bells of the poor.
The experts who played the carillon in July called it a "treasure of culture" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also mentioned that this was the world's first carillon played by the black musician Dionisio A. Lindas. 18 years ago, he began playing the larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him with another musician.
What has happened in the past few months in St. Martin’s Church has been a complicated story involving architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by the church’s laymen and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Sacristy, a parish governing body made up of lay leaders, in July expressed concern to the diocese that the diocese would "try to pass on the expenses" to the sacristy, although it did not hire architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Lobster Catcher in California
Authorities said the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was catching lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
He was attacked at 7 a.m. in Ensinitas near the beach of Lighthouse.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then came with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was worried about catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: “I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire clavicle had been torn out.
“I shouted out to everyone to get out of the water: ‘A shark is swimming in the water!’”
The boy was taken by plane to the San Diego Rady Children's Hospital, where he was admitted in critical condition.
What kind of shark was attacked by the boy is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the torso.
Authorities shut down the beach for 48 hours from Casablanca Ponto to Ensinitas Swami.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the zone, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty departments, which will be staffed by specialist consultants.
As the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market continues to grow and fashion and household goods sales decline, larger beauty outlets will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, more stores will be set up next year.
Investments in beauty are growing, and supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelves that were once designed for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's has announced it will double its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more local brands in areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The mall is also releasing its "Boutique" range of makeup, most of which is vegan, which is increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will try discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the desire to buy small quantities from local convenience stores on a daily basis require supermarkets to do more to attract people to visit.
Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe said the outlets are increasingly looking like department stores as supermarket chains try to crack down on cheaper Aldi and Lidl stores offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has added Argos outlets to hundreds of stores and has also set up a number of Habitat stores since it bought both networks two years ago, which are said to have boosted groceries sales and made them more profitable.
A previous attempt by the mall to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 1900s, but the alliance ended in a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores to Lloyds Pharmacy's Celesio three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It was said that Lloyds contributed to the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We’ve changed the exterior and atmosphere of our beauty departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and thanks to its attractive environment and convenient location, we are now an attractive place of beauty, challenging the old way of purchasing.”
Peter Jones is “infuriated” by Holly Willoughby’s <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragon Den star Peter Jones has become “enraged” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer has time for their household and accessory brand Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of this morning's show has announced she's leaving on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left a lucrative lifestyle brand at the last moment to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, annoying Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources said Jones was "infuriated" when a golden television girl at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted during Tuesday's tense meeting that she would not have enough time to devote to his Truly brand of household goods and accessories because of new deals of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, and was supposed to double Willoughby’s <0xC2><0xA3>11m fortune.
As 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly has so far been one of Holly’s top priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone.
No one could believe what was going on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
The Marlou headquarters is a full warehouse of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that leaving the host of The Morning, one of Britain’s most financially successful stars, could cost the company millions due to heavy investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household items, as well as delays in getting things started.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had close ties with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for a decade.
In 2016, Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for the M&S brand and replace Anta McPartlin, the host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity."
A source close to Jones said yesterday: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
We talked hard and “then we fell in love.”
He joked about criticism from the media for a comment that some might consider “non-presidential” as well as a positive response to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Shortly, in a mockery of the "news host" voice, he said:
“I didn’t refuse anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was seen as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not receiving an "adequate response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
He expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, including the completion of missile tests, aid in releasing hostages and returning the remains of American troops home.
He defended his unusual attitude by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people wanting to get into this stuffy arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was deployed, it was not declared a national disaster – a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been made very clear that there is no need for international aid, so it's a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were looking at the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute.
Given Indonesia’s persistent earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the warning, is likely to have led to an increase in the number of lives lost.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands at the best time is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has chosen the reconstruction of Indonesia's ruined infrastructure as the centrepiece of his election campaign, spending generously on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has troubled the Yoko administration, as he will run again in the election next year.
Yoko also faces pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority hold to a more conservative form of belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows with arrows and other simple weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a long-distance scoring goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
As their team was 1–0 behind, Xherdan Shaqiri handed the ball over to former Sturridge about 30 meters from the Chelsea gates.
He threw the ball on his left leg and hit a long-distance swing.
The ball, raised high above the penalty area, flew to the upper right corner of the net.
He eventually flew over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
“I was just trying to get into a position where I got the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to keep as much time as possible for the shot,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante running, I made the ball with one touch, and without thinking too much, I just kicked.”
Belgian star Eden Hazard scored Chelsea 1-0 in the 25th minute.
During that attack, the blue attacker returned the ball to Mateo Kovacic in the heel in the middle of the field and hurried towards Liverpool.
In the middle of the square, he quickly played the wall.
He then aptly sent the ball between the opponents to the penalty area for Hazard.
Hazard overtook the defenders and passed Liverpool player Alisson Becker with a left-handed kick, pointing the ball into the net to the long-distance swing.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet with Videoton at 3 p.m. in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia’s disaster agency said early Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that many people were stranded in the ruins of buildings destroyed by Friday's 7.5-magnitude quake that caused waves of six metres.
The town of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered in debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
The murder investigation began this morning after a woman's body was found in Burkenhead, Marysside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. at Graison Miuse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police called on people who had seen or heard someone in the area to speak.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would like to address anyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to address everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have captured something on the video recorder, and contact us as they may have information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed the woman, whose body was found, was a Berkenhead resident and was found inside the building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police have reported that they are informing the victim’s immediate relatives.
A taxi driver living in Greyson Miuse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one should enter or leave the building.
He lost his voice when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told they will have to wait a few hours before they can return home.
It was heard that a police officer was explaining to one person that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared in tears at the scene.
She said, “It’s so scary.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in front of the barrier on the inside and another van was behind it from the outside.
Many officers stood on the inner side of the barrier and watched the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, indicating the number 247.
The statue of Parliament Cromwell is hit by the final blow of the "rewriting of history" dispute.
Its elimination would be poetic justice for the actions of the Taliban, reminiscent of the destruction of England’s cultural and religious heritage by the fanatical Cromwell Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the transfer of statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell near Westminster Palace was inevitably to be a target.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent image of Cromwell, created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft, is a reflection of 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of honor.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, which was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether this is true or not is still disputed by historians.
One thing is clear: the conflict of the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exclusive figure representing one of the sides of this divide.
His achievements as a defender of the Lord deserve to be celebrated and honored as well.”
Killer Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
Local media reports said a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a man named Yuan had been found dead after being engulfed in blood because of his damaged artery and lying next to a pig in the market in Liupansuy, Guizhou Province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer in a pig house in Sining, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to administer vaccines to pigs.
He said he and his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province were planning to go to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found a relative dead and found the door open to a nearby piggy bank.
He said there was a big boar in the piggy bank whose mouth was smeared with blood.
According to the report, forensics confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms tore the farmer to death.
The Guiyang Evening News quoted him as saying: "My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," the cousin, who gave his last name as Wu, said.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man's torn animal, Yuan, or his cousin did not belong.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had to be locked up to stop attacking other people and kept until police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the deaths.
There have been a few, but few, cases of pigs attacking humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 295 kilogram pig pushed a Welsh farmer onto a tractor and pushed him until his wife chased him away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but the taste of blood may contribute to aggressiveness.
“They’re just playful.
They like to bite, very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa Will Bring Heavy Rain to Southwest
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves through the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring heavy rain to all of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa was moving at a speed of 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane from 5:00 a.m. on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Cape Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
At the same time, on the Pacific side, an elongated low-pressure area begins to form and moves eastward, toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, she will begin to carry large amounts of tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimetres of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching elongated low-pressure area, will then bring widespread abundant rain to the southwest over the coming days.
On the spot, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain will cause a dangerous sudden flood, a stream of debris and a possible landslide in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause some areas, particularly southern Nevada and Arizona, to fall between 5 and 8 centimetres per hour of rainfall.
Five to eight centimetres of rain is expected in the southwest, particularly in large parts of Arizona.
The discontinuous nature of tropical rainfall can lead to sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions.
When a tropical storm threatens, it would be a particularly bad idea to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain canyons can turn into raging rivers, and thunderstorms could cause wind and dust surges.
The approaching elongated low-pressure area will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
More than a centimeter of precipitation is expected, which could lead to a small stream of debris, and roads could become slippery.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Some sporadic tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and then spread into late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall across Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will spread Tuesday and continue Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropical zone will be relatively warm.
Sometimes this leads to huge changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday was a great example of huge temperature differences in the central United States.
Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) temperatures are almost 20 degrees different from those in St. Louis and Di Moin (Iowa).
In the next few days, the summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
Much of the central and eastern U.S., from the Great South Plains to the northeastern regions, is expected to arrive in warm October, with temperatures in many parts of the United States warming 27 degrees Celsius.
Temperatures in New York City are expected to rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that temperatures in the eastern United States will be higher than the average perennial temperature in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched prominent remarks by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and accusations of sexual violence by Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s on six television broadcasts on Thursday.
But the political stalemate continued after broadcasters interrupted regular programming due to Friday's last-minute change, with Arizona's senator agreeing to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, who was drunk at a high school party, grabbed her and tried to take off her clothes.
Kavanaugh testified angrily that he was absolutely certain that this was not the case.
Nielsen said Friday that it was likely more than 20.4 million people watched the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers who watched the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in counting people watching television in offices.
To explain it more clearly, it is an audience of the same size as it would be during a playoff football match or an Oscar.
Nielsen reported that the Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, was ahead of all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers per full-day court session.
With 3.26 million viewers, ABC was in second place.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
There was great interest at the end of the trial.
The main character of Friday’s drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters yelled at him as he tried to take the elevator to a court hearing.
CNN filmed it live with its eyes down as it was flooded with people.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and added that he would have more to say at the court hearing before the elevator closed.
Cable television and broadcast networks then discussed directly when the Judiciary Committee voted Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so in the knowledge that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which the Democratic minority had called for.
Flake, speaking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partly convinced.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Britain's prime minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in an interview with the Sunday Times of "playing politics" with Britain's future and seeking to undermine national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published under her picture on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called "Brexit checkers" plan that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs, saying it was "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims Shooting Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson Over LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a person suspected of killing 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of the Sims-Simpson clash, with police saying Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The CBS branch WAFB reported that police took the glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, police said he shot Wayde to death.
The attorney informs that his release deposit is <0x24>350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish’s expert service released a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a shot in the head and neck.
The department awards credits to the Louisiana Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, Southern University Police, and residents of the district who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the rayon law enforcement for their "practice and administration of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds during the game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked".
“You think about it all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano spitting out ash in Mexico City
From the volcano Popocatepetl erupted ash, which reached the southern areas of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after a crater activity peaked and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center observed many thunders and tremors.
Social media photos show thin ash-covered car windshields in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Chocimilke.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
On the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined anti-government demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote.
The riot police, who are stopping a group of masked separatists, were slapped with eggs and powdered paint, triggering dark dust clouds in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Police used canes to end the fighting that began later in the day.
Within hours, the independence groups singing “Unforgettable, Unforgivable” were confronted by unionist protesters who shouted: “Long live Spain!”
The local press reported that 14 people were being treated for minor injuries during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, considered illegal by Madrid but sung by Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the region, which is seeking independence.
The majority of voters chose to become independent, but voter turnout was low due to the large number of boycotters who did not want to break away.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes as police across the region tried to stop polling stations last year.
Pro-independence groups set up the camp on Friday night to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
The demonstration took place, but the route had to be changed.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who is taking part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer sure about Catalonia's prospects for independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents shout happily at those who can vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite a crucial and hard-to-achieve victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to keep up this year after many of their most prominent leaders fled voluntary exile or were detained awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and later declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was supporting police and filming the protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
“The tension is constantly growing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed since the end of last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry —Men Arrested for Driving Into a House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after driving into a Londonderry house.
The incident happened on Thursday around 19.30 (BVL) at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building were damaged.
At some point, a crossbow could also be fired into the car.
Menga wins Livingston 1:0 against the Rangers
Livingston's Dolly Menga's first goal wins
Moving to higher leagues, Livingston surprised the Rangers by forcing Ibrox manager Steven Gerrard to lose second in 18 games.
Dolly Menga’s hit proved to be a big hit, as in an instant, Gary Holt’s team was on a par with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not won any away games in the Premier League this season and will meet with the Hearts next Sunday, eight points behind.
On Thursday, the Rangers will play in the Europa League against Rapid Vienna.
At the same time, Livingston extended its unrivalled series of unmatched games in the division to six, and head coach Holt has not yet tasted defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller only last month.
Livingston misses out on chances in a game with staggered guests
Even before Holt scored the goal, his perseverance, which raises the Rangers' various problems, should have led the team a long time ago.
At first, Scott Robinson broke through and struck across the gate, then Alan Lithgow failed to reach the ball passed by Craig Halkett's head, and he rolled off the gate.
The hosts weren’t worried about letting the Rangers play in the front because they knew they could cause trouble to guests by creating standard positions.
That is how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free kick and Livingston began to push forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson handed the ball to Menga, who stopped and scored from the midfield.
Since then, the Rangers have been in control of the ball for longer, but the defense of the hosts was invincible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no job.
The game continued in the second half, though Kelly had to work hard to keep Alfredo Morelos from hitting the goal.
Scott Pittman’s shot was shot by Allan McGregor, the goalkeeper of the Rangers, and then a Lithgow shot after another Livingston’s standard position.
The ball was constantly in the Livingston penalty area, but was kicked every time, and two demands for a penalty - one for Halkett's collision with replacement Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball by hand - were not met.
Analysis of the Phenomenal "Livingston" performance
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal Livingston game and result.
All of them were excellent and continued to exceed expectations due to the ever-improving gameplay.
The style and staff of the game haven't changed much since returning to the top league, but Holt deserves a great deal of credit as he set the team on fire when he arrived.
He was supported by many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a great player with a well-organized defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall not to lose vigilance.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they played well under Gerrard's leadership, this time they lacked much to reach their level.
They made few decisive kicks and only once broke through the defenses of the hosts. A kind of alarm bell to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has been met in many ways.
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
The leaders argued over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
It is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have banned 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, have also sought to be heard in condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to meet him at home.
Various protests show a division among visitors: some German Turks see him as a hero, while others call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford. A cyclist dies after colliding with a car
In London, a cyclist died after colliding with a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy Deptford Road, in the southeast of the city at around 10.15am BVL.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics also arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened a few months after another cyclist was killed on Childers Street by the perpetrator, who then fled. The accident happened about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
Police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes are changed, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartino Prison: Six Officers Injured
The prison service said six prison officials were wounded in a major turmoil in a high-security male prison.
The turmoil occurred at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9.30 a.m. at the BVL, where it continues.
Special Tornado officers were called in to control the turmoil, which involves eight prisoners and takes place on one wing of the prison.
Officers are being treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison official said: "Specially trained prison staff were called in to manage the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are confident that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly spend a longer time behind bars."
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals, are being held in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was being treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot control officers were summoned to jail to manage a serious upheaval in which some workers were thrown with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with its flash floods (for arid areas, this may be useful)
Tropical depression isn’t uncommon in Arizona, but that’s what’s likely to happen next week, when Hurricane Rosa and its remaining energy stretch through the desert’s southwest, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already said it was surprised by the flash floods in western Arizona on Monday and Tuesday, spreading to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday as it approaches rain on late Monday.
In Phoenix, the National Meteorological Service noted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status within 322 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane no more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona border.
Using the latest models from the National Hurricane Center, the prism is predicted to reach 5 to 10 centimetres in precipitation, while parts of Arizona's Mogolon Rim are expected to reach 5 centimetres in precipitation.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to reach 2.5 to 5 centimetres, with some areas likely to receive up to 10 centimetres of rainfall.
For people who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some may benefit from it, as the southwest is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from a very severe drought, which is in the second-highest category.”
First, Hurricane Rosa travels to the coast across the entire peninsula of California, which belongs to Mexico.
Rosa, still a hurricane with a massive wind of 137 kilometres per hour on Sunday, is 619 kilometres south of Cape Eugenia in Mexico and heading north at 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is colliding with cooler waters in the Pacific and is therefore calming down.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday at lunch or in the evening.
Precipitation from certain parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
“From the California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, 8 to 15 centimetres are expected, but possibly up to 25 centimetres of rainfall,” it said.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm, then reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression on Tuesday morning, and then head through Arizona towards southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or its remnants is very high rainfall on the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora and southwestern US desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods, a stream of debris in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Assault on Midsamer Nortone: Four arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in Midsamer Nortone’s Excelsior terrace area at around 04.00 on Saturday, according to the BVL.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable condition.
Avon and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock district.
Officers approached anyone who might have any mobile-phone footage of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has been hurt by the vileness, the anger of the Democratic Party."
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote by which we would like to reject the relentless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a speech in Wilinge, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "experienced the vileness and anger of the Democratic Party" during his candidacy process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress Thursday that he strongly and emotionally denies Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers decades ago.
Ford also testified at the trial on his charges.
On Saturday, the president said: “The Americans saw that day how cool, noble and brave Kavanaugh was.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a proven track record in public service,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while at the same time referring to the importance of Republican turnout in mid-term elections.
“We have five weeks left until the most important election of our life.
“I’m not here, but I’m really here,” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said Democrats were trying to “resist and hinder.”
Senior GOP aide CNN said the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed by Indonesia earthquake and tsunami
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were tossed to death by huge waves hitting the beach after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia’s Sulawesi island.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu on Friday after six-metre-high waves slammed into the coast after dark, many of them hurling to death and destroying everything that happened on the road.
After the tsunami, there was a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and were not fleeing immediately, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t strike alone, he pulled back cars, logs, houses, he hit everything that was on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had flown at 800 km/h in the open sea before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs of the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the seaside town continued to be shaken by aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's quake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The tsunami may have been exacerbated by the city's geographical location, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "major" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped beneath the rubble of buildings, later adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be higher along a coast 300 kilometres north of Palu in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Nugroho said communications networks were "completely paralyzed, so no information was received" from Dongala.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross spokesman said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers were travelling to the affected areas.
It was said that "it can already be considered a tragedy, but the situation could get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticised for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves arrived after a warning was issued.
In the shared amateur social media footage, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming, insane, about an impending tsunami for people below the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, carrying away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and the tsunami disrupted the power supply, cutting off communications networks around Palu and making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate assistance.
Authorities said the army had begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities with aid supplies, but those evacuated were still in dire need of food and other basic supplies.
The city’s airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has surpassed 800.
That's very bad.
Doseba said that when World Vision staff were safely travelling from Dongala to Palu, where they were sheltering in tents in the backyard of the office, devastated views accompanied them along the way.
“They told me they had seen a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to take difficult steps to provide relief in the disaster, some people complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience were banned from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel recruited from abroad can only help when the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"This is still a provincial disaster," said Indonesia's Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani.
“When the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can call for international assistance, but that status has not yet been announced.”
In the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing people had hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would affect the gloomy history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of the sewer.
Rescuers on Sunday freed a woman who had been crushed under rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Indonesian national paraglider team coach Gendon Subandono had trained two missing paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The rest of those stranded at the Roa Roa hotel, including the courtesy, were his students.
"Because I'm older in paragliding, I'm carrying my emotional burden," he said.
Gandon described in detail how within hours of the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, this news travelled around the paragliding community. He desperately sent messages using the WhatsApp app to Palu's rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages contained only one gray, not two blue ticks.
"I think that means the messages were not received," he said.
Newport on the Levee thieves stole <0x24>26,750 while filling an ATM
According to a Newport Police Department press release, on Friday morning the thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's employee who refilled an ATM at Newport on the Levee.
"The driver of the car was knocking down the ATM in the amusement complex and ready to add more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man "run from behind the back of a Brink's employee" and stole a sack of money for replenishment.
Witnesses had spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, but police were unable to quantify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. The rapper changed his name to Ye
Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted: "A person formerly officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been known as Ye, the name given to his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began ahead of Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He is to replace singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons," he said.
Not only is this a shortening of his current professional title, West has said it has a religious meaning.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, referring to the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and turned into just Ye, which means the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but announced this year that he preferred Love and Brotherly Love.
Former West colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador (abbreviated AMLO) has vowed not to use troops against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed to "never use military force to restrain the Mexican population" in Tlatelolco Square.
On October 2, 1968, while left-leaning student movements began across Latin America, the military fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has solemnly promised to support young Mexicans by subsidising students every month and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are dragging young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. to double funding for artificial intelligence
"As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field," said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and specialist in artificial intelligence at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various U.S. government bodies published reports on artificial intelligence, even as the U.S. has no official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
China, meanwhile, unveiled its plan last year to lead innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the U.S. and are looking forward to the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubled funding could double the chances of the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the U.S., as Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top American Othello player and later served as the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help find more insightful people.
Lee said U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win state grants.
"It's not China that takes away academic leaders, it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts on artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said, China National Science Foundation funds people from academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations donate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA (Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) announced a <0x24>2 billion investment for AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
But nothing has been done in the coming months about U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Macedonians voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that will resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes Macedonia's province, says the name of its northern neighbour claims Greek territory and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on a proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents say the name change would harm the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the turnout would reach the minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum to take effect.
The question was asked on the voting card: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership after the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs said they would stick to the vote and make it decisive.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
But turnout was just 16 percent, up from 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian lawmaker Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko are voting in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country’s name to open the way to joining NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of tents erected by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not to enter through the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in the integration of Eurasia."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent, would attract much-needed investment.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
The result, he said, would be “assurance of our future.”
According to a poll published by Macedonia's political research institute last Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters are expected to vote in the referendum -- less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma television, 57 percent of voters are preparing to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote “yes”.
For a referendum to be successful, 50 percent of the electorate plus one vote must be present.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious failure of the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero beats all of Brighton's defenses and scoring
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton and Manchester City won 2:0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored the goal in the 65th minute, seemingly with incredible ease.
The Argentine striker received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the offensive.
Before entering the open field, he flew among the three Brighton defenders.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-shirted players.
He broke through one defender before overtaking several others at the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then passed the ball to the left, where there was Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero with one kick from the penalty area, and Aguero kicked the ball to the right of the net with a right foot, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero has foot problems," City chief Pep Guardiola told reporters.
He said he would play for 55-60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky to have him at that point.”
Still, it was Sterling who helped the Sky Blues lead the way in this Premier League game.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball from the depths of the Brighton court during the attack.
Along the left side of the square between the two opponents, he nicely passed the ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball forward with a few kicks while Sterling rushed towards the farthest stick.
The Sky Blues striker kicked the ball into the goal just before slipping out of the field.
On Tuesday, at 12:55 pm, City meets Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game at the Rhein-Neckar arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a friendly game with the Rockies
After the Nationals dropped out of the playoffs, there were no valid reasons for forcing again.
Competitive Scherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to survive in the playoffs; in the National League West they are one point ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies, who beat the Nationals 5:2 on Friday night, have at least secured the chance to win a preferential pass, but still have to make an effort to secure the right to play in the first division.
“While we’re playing for nothing, at least we can get off the field knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, with a crowd of people and the rest of the team, will probably be at the highest level we’ll be able to reach this year.
Why not argue?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting line-up for Sunday's match, but they are clearly willing to release Scherzer in this case.
Scherzer, who will be 34 in the barrel of the game, made a throw on Thursday and will take the thrower's position on his normal day of rest on Sunday.
Washington right-hander statistics for this season: 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 aut<0xC5><0xB3> in 220 2/3 of the half.
Trump speaks in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the president indirectly refers to the situation regarding the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have achieved will be placed on the scales in November.
We have five weeks until the most important election of our life.
That’s very, very important, I don’t run... but I actually run, that’s why I fight everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
“You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how angry it is.
They don’t care what they hurt, what they climbed over to get power and control; that’s what they really want—power and control—but we won’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and hinder.”
"You see this over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, ugly, lowly and unjust people."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked huge ovations.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Oh, uh, how.
No, uh... no, I’m waiting for one thing—it was really poor body language—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour has lost its diversity of opinion.
They can’t stand those who speak their minds openly.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to distrust me, I wondered if I should have been surprised.
Finally, I am the latest Labour MP to be told that I am unwelcome – and that’s for my opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has received similar threats because she has taken a determined stand against anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Because of the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically, on similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a statement on Friday, the Nottingham East Labour meeting said: "We want a large number of members to participate in the meetings and that the meetings are productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were exactly that.
Sadly, today the tone of many meetings is not at all the same as the promises of a "softer, more pleasant" policy have long since been forgotten, even if they have ever been put into practice.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissent in the Labour Party is not tolerated and that every opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy took the lead of the party, and colleagues who, as I had previously believed, had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and hold opinions that I would never agree with, whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly -- and no matter what -- there is a tirade of insults on social media that incite my recall, condemn the centre's policies, and say I have no place in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
In fact, I am much more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments made to me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to endure an avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things about this political era is how insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the same party of the same views, and with every procedure of "confidence" or change in the electoral system, this party is getting smaller and smaller.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice to keep me from jumping out, not talking so loud, and then “everything will be fine.”
But that’s not what I came for in politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thatcher government’s negligence, which literally brought down my entire school class, I have sought to obtain better public services for those who need them most, whether as a member of the local council or a government minister.
I’ve never done anything wrong with my policy, including the recent election.
“No one in Nottingham East should have been surprised by my political views and disagreements with current leaders.
To those who pushed for the procedure on Friday, I can say that as the country digs towards Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact one message I have in Nottingham Momentum to my constituents, Labour or otherwise: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of revocation or political expediency will stop me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr-Melrose – 38:17 Invincible Ayr conquers the tops of the tables
Two late attempts have somewhat distorted the final results, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved this moment of triumph in the spectacular, breathtaking Tennent’s Premiership day game.
Now the team is at the top of the table - the only one that has not been beaten.
Ultimately, the victory was brought to them by impeccable defense and well-exercised opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
“We’ve put all the challenges through all the games we’ve played so far and we’re still out of the game, so I’m really happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr did well, the players used their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was successfully completed by Frazier Climo, led the Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, which was issued by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to get the numbers, and the Baggot stopped the unsuccessful attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage by a fine after scoring points in the middle of the race and successfully completing his personal test, helping Ayr to pull back 17:5 before the break.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was successfully completed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
The match was halted for a long time because of Ruaridh Knott's serious injury, and he was taken to the stretcher. The Ayr continued to advance after Stafford McDowall's attempt was successfully completed by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card and Melrose tried to use the surplus, but Bruce Colvine's attempt was unsuccessful after the fierce pressure.
The home team player returned, but when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without the ball, MacPherson pressed the ball off the penalty line behind the location of the ongoing Ayr match.
Climo successfully completed his attempt, as he had done almost from the start of the rematch, after Kyle Rowe stopped David Armstrong from kicking into the corner of the field and prevented home team forward Gregor Henry from holding his fifth attempt to score.
Still Game star appears ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be ready to move into the hospitality industry after he was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old starred Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, scripting and starring with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
Officially, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the fact, although sources in the Scottish Sun have hinted that Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business."
'We Own the Sea': Bolivia jailed on land hopes court to open way back to ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The blue flag of the ocean is waving on public buildings.
A naval base stretching from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bears the motto: “We rightly own the sea.
It is our duty to bring it back.”
Bolivia, trapped all over the land, is still alive with memories of access to the ocean, sacrificed to Chile in the bloody 19th-century conflict over resources, once again engrossed in the Pacific.
The hopes of recent decades have now been greatly strengthened, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be issued on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia is united in a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes for positive results," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the court’s ruling on big screens in hopes that the Hague tribunal will make a positive decision on Bolivia’s complaint, obliging Chile to negotiate access to the country’s seaside.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic Indian president who faces a controversial election battle over his re-election, is also keen on what Monday's decision will bring to an end.
"We are very close to the prospect of a return to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will make a decision in Bolivia’s favor — even if it does, little would change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to cut off Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of the talks.
The fact that the ICJ’s ruling will be issued only six months after the final arguments were heard is hardly an indication that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an expert on Chilean international law.
And even if Bolivia managed to make some progress, the last four years could have thrown it backwards.
"This issue of access to the sea has been raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She believes that any remnants of Chilean goodwill have been destroyed by the vengeful rhetoric of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to discuss.
The country has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's ruling was unusually swift.
“On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start an era of new relations with Chile and to end 139 years of discord for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, and uses the sea issue as a political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“A decision is an opportunity to see that we have to come to terms with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is possible only if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has pledged that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises, which rival leaders agreed at a meeting in Singapore.
His comments came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be resuming nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting Kim in Singapore.
Ri says a “utopian dream” is that by continuing sanctions and renouncing the declaration of the end of the Korean War, the United States could one day bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to endorse the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes credible disarmament action.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is not serious about giving up its arsenal, which the country seems to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headgear, and they will soon conquer the nearest trendy stores
If you want to add to your collection of hats or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentrically large headgear in their spring and summer 2019 collections, and he simply stunned Paris Fashion Week viewers with his style.
These extremely impractical hats conquered the social network Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
A distinctive creation of Valentine was a huge body-colored hat decorated with a wide, feather-like edge that encloses the mannequin’s head.
Other non-standard size accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat and even pineapple – but they’re not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn on the lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One of the pieces looked like a diver’s suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other resembled a melted ice nozzle.
And if you follow this huge fashion trend, you will not ask.
Style experts speculate that these huge veils can get into stores.
Huge hats became popular with La Bomba high heels, straw hats with two-foot edges were already worn by everyone - from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which has created extremely impractical hats that have conquered all social networks, has released another huge piece on the catwalk – a straw beach bag, almost the same size as the model wearing her swimsuit.
The red-brick Raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, became an exclusive highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I think next summer, huge hats and beach bags will be coming to the stores, because the designer has made such a big impact, so it would be hard to ignore the need for non-standard size accessories.”
John Edward: “Language proficiency is an essential skill for the citizens of the world”
Scotland’s independent schools broke records for academic achievement in 2018 and once again demonstrated outstanding exam results, which were further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other community merits.
With a total of more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest possible level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and to be global citizens.
Working in the education sector, which is able to design and implement the planned school curriculum, we can see that modern languages continue to be popular and willingly choose them in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you can talk to a man in a language he understands, he will understand you with his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of this year’s exams, we can say that languages are at the peak of popularity and have the best retention ratings in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of foreign language learners received the highest A rating.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A grade in the Mandarin language exam, 72 percent of those who learned German, and 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish received the highest A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland see foreign language skills as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as an elective are now as important as basic subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that of all the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill jobs, 17% lacked language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
As the future employability will depend heavily on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses to pursue with a second language, he or she will be much better off than others in the future if he or she has these lifelong skills.
By being able to communicate directly with people from abroad, a person who speaks several languages will be much more competitive.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to be interviewed, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
Several languages, especially in developing countries, will improve children's chances of meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school is different according to the languages it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages considered to be most important to the UK in view of the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests may be, there will always be many languages to choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in the field.
Scotland’s independent schools are ready to create a teaching environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to live in the future.
It is undeniable that in today’s global business environment, languages remain vital to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in the education system as well.
Indeed, modern languages should definitely be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and outcomes to Scottish youth.
This must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans have little time to wait to see LeBron James start the season with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the Sunday season opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes it will take is still unclear.
"It's going to be more than one minute and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers in six pre-season games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need any more pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's Speech on the YouTube Channel in West Virginia
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign tonight in Wilings, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned speeches next week, including stopovers in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
After approving the suspension of the nomination of his Supreme Court nominee, Trump is seeking to mobilize support in the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in November.
What time will the Trump talk take place in West Virginia tonight and how can we watch it online?
Trump’s speech in Vilinge, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time (Eastern Time) on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s speech in West Virginia online on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to touch on this week's topic of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, as she has been sowing much tension over allegations of sexual misconduct after the Senate voted to suspend the nomination for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main goal of the campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength in the run-up to the November election.
The goal of the five meetings next week, according to Reuters, is to "energise volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to defend and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Control of Congress is so high on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as a very hot campaign season begins," said a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named.
“The speech planned for tonight at Willing Wesbanco Arena should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” the Metro News of West Virginia said.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is polled at the bottom of the ratings.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come in to trump him to the top of the rankings," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team is fighting hard and looking forward to Sunday’s unit race
After three personal rounds on Saturday afternoon, the four may be just what was needed for this Ryder Cup tournament.
This variation in success is completely fictional, but players really believe it, especially in competitions like this one.
On whose side is success now?
"They were six points ahead and now four, so I guess we can consider it a little bit of a success," Spieth said as he prepared for the day.
Of course, Europe is in the lead, has a four-point lead and still has 12 games to play.
The enthusiasm of the Americans, according to Spieth, has faded, and they do not lack it, not to mention the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four points.
Spieth was invincible from the beginning to the end and was irreproachably ahead.
As the round continued, the wild victories continued to grow and Thomas scored two points out of two to finish the fourth game in a draw.
His strike, which won them the match at Hole 15, was accompanied by similar shouts that said the American team was not in danger of ending.
“You just have to focus on your own game,” Spieth said.
Now each of these players has to play separately.
By the end of the day, there will be 18 holes.
The only players to score more than Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couple from Europe scored four points out of four possible and can be calm.
Moliwood was the only couple who didn’t need to be hit not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings.
That course of events and the reaction of the raging spectators only confirm that they will be the players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinari, who, after the last rays of the descending sun, have a chance to ensure the victory of Europe.
It would be good to have both at the same time in different wells.
Although it is too early to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played with Sergio Garcia, the eastern four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An extra kick and two double kicks in the first nine-hole series pushed the Spaniards and Swedes into trouble that they never managed to get out of.
No one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four-ball and four-ball matches are so interesting to watch because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and the fact that the strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe played better as a team and came to the finals decisively, but this four-stage show that the US team has a backbone that some, especially in the states, have questioned.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe is in the lead 10:6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a strong lead, leading against the United States at 10:6 after Saturday's quarter-finals.
The inspirational duet between Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario continued to warm the atmosphere, winning two victories over struggling Tiger Woods and taking Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in order to preserve the trophy that Hazeltine lost two years ago, dominated the unsuccessful American side in the morning four games and ended the round with a 3:1 result.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four games when it won two games but failed to score.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12-piece match to hold the trophy in his hands.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points after dubbing Molliwood with Molinari after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four, they smashed up the confidence-poor Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even better score of 5:4.
Woods, who otherwise beat two Saturday games, showed a high level of professionalism at some points, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his four games, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose rested in the morning fours and returned to play with his partner Henrik Stenson in the fours, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, both first and third in the world rankings.
Despite the pleasant, gentle breeze of the day in southwest Paris, Europe has not gone through everything like butter.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raised the bar with two points on Saturday.
In a four-ball game, they won a tough 2:1 against Spain's Jonas Rahma and Ian Poulter, and in a four-ball game they beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 without hitting the ball in the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team managed to win a four-point lead in single matches, although Furyko's half would have had enough draws to keep the trophy.
Even though they were in second place for two days, on Sunday they seem to have turned their backs on luck.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions had deepened their mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons.
Ri told the General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" over the past year, including halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we have not received a similar response from the US," he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and under such circumstances, we will by no means be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s complaints about Washington’s opposition to a step-by-step approach to nuclear disarmament that rewards North Korea by step-by-step action, his statement was different in that he did not completely reject the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri hinted at a joint statement by Kim and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on "disarmament of the Korean peninsula" and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States demands nuclear disarmament first and is stepping up the pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by coercive methods, even renouncing the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“To think that sanctions can bring us to our knees is like pursuing utopian dreams for people who don’t care.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted by the US leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he emphasised three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: "If South Korea were the next country on this nuclear disarmament issue rather than the US, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
However, Ri’s tone of speech changed dramatically compared to last year when he told the UN General Assembly that when “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket lord” preparing a suicide mission, it was absolutely inevitable to direct North Korean missiles to the United States.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said there was still a long way to go and that sanctions must remain until North Korea met its nuclear disarmament requirements.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia said the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pomeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must be resolutely continued without any concessions until there is complete and definitive, proven nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously approved sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri behind the scenes at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to unleash the soil for the next meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a failure.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying all the progress had been to get North Korea to announce within hours that he had made "gangster demands".
North Korea said at a meeting with Moon this month that it would dismantle the missile base and nuclear facility if the United States took "appropriate measures".
Kim said the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and a move to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of its students to sleep more to fight a growing macho culture in studios, consuming caffeine and staying awake at night.
One academic found that in the best university in the world, students often do not even have the basic knowledge to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Brigham City, a specialist in women’s hospitals, have prepared a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspiration to prepare this course came to him after talking about the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told about this now, in the final year of my studies?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains how the most important quality sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services department, said the university had decided to offer the course after it became clear that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive exercises.
One section contains a dormitory room photo where students can click on a cup of coffee, curtains, simulators, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and how important sleep routines are.
In the next section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.

“We understand that this will not change the behavior of the students.
But we think they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know about the health consequences of choosing to smoke,” Professor Czeisler explained.
The culture of pride to not sleep overnight, he said, still exists. Modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to the growing problem of sleep deprivation.
“Ensuring students get enough and quality sleep should be their secret weapon in fighting stress, exhaustion, and anxiety,” he said, “even avoiding gaining weight because lack of sleep switches the brain to fasting, so students are constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped prepare Professor Czeisler's course when he attended one of his courses last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course accessible to the entire campus.
It hopes that the next step will be to invite all postgraduate students to take this course before enrolling in this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm when it’s time to go to sleep, just like when getting up, and beware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic devices and LED lights, as they can knock your circadian rhythm out of balance, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset Gerrard's men
The Rangers were disappointed when Dolly Mengai Livingstone defeated Steven Gerrard in a 1:0 victory.
Ibrox had hoped to win their first outing win after February's 4:1 st Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, and he is now eight points behind the premier league's Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but the uninspired Rangers didn't see a chance to even out the score.
The Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston to third, and Hibernian are only one goal behind.
And the Rangers' troubles don't end there, because the tribune butter probably hit the side judge Calum Spence in the head and injured him.
Gerrard made four substitutions that allowed him to overtake Ayr and lead him to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt trusted the same 11-year-old who took a point from the Hearts last week, and he would have liked the way his well-thought-out combinations tied opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They were able to score in the second minute when Menga passed the ball to Scott Pittman, who was heading towards Allan McGregor's goal, with a close kick, but the midfielder destroyed his chance by deflecting the ball away from the goal.
After a long shot by Keaghan Jacobs, the free kick ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow slammed by.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game, there was only hope, not belief in their game.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson threw his hands at Colombian.
The Rangers only scored twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely frightened by Lassana Coulibaly's head kick or a gentle parade of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi’s 34-minute goal may not have matched the game, no one would argue that they deserved it for their efforts alone.
The Rangers once again failed to beat Jacobs's viscous defense.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his temper and handed it over to Menga for an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action to change Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately bore fruit when the wingman played Morelos, but Kelly, who played spectacularly, ran back.
Livingston drew guests into the game they loved, with long-distance passes from Lithgowo and Halketto.
Holt's team was able to raise their lead at the end, but McGregor defended himself against Jacobs's strike after Lithgow was shot from the corner.
Rangers player Glenn Middleton once again appealed for a penalty at the end of the match after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today it's 136 years ago and MORE... On that day, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention that later led to the creation of a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, the device has been a hit in the scientific world, and later a hit in popular culture, when the cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado:
The man said, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “This Geiger counter is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear how atoms work when touched by radioactive minerals."
Evans: “Hey, it’s really shooting right now!”
Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention of his name continues.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to See Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to See Bad Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Learns Immune System to Recognize Bad Cells – Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
The cells can then ‘see’ the proteins that are common to many cancers, and then inject them back into the body again.
The trial vaccine has yielded promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
In one woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches her immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has gone away for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from the patient and replacing them in a laboratory so that the cells can see the proteins that are characteristic of HER2 cancers and then inject them back again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
"HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and rectum," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which immune cells are extracted from patients and taught to target cancer cells, has been successfully applied in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West released a tirade supporting Trump wearing a MAGA cap after his appearance on the SNL show.
The good doesn't end there
After the frivolous show, Saturday Night Live spectators cheered Kanye West, who praised US President Donald Trump, and said he would take part in the 2020 campaign.
After performing a third song that night, "Ghost Town," in which he wore a cap that said "Make America Great," he continued to denounce Democrats and voice his support for Trump.
"How many times have I talked to white people, they said, 'How can you like Trump because he's a racist?'
Well, if racism were a concern for me, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show began with a comic scene in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual misconduct by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, West's footage was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock tried to mock West with this video.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the scenes because of his headgear.
“They were mocking me behind the scenes.
He said he wouldn't go there with a hat like that.
They made fun of me!
They said I had reached the bottom," he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see what the bottom is? <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> He asked. <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> I’m wearing my superman cap, and that means you can’t tell me what to do.
“Begin to love.”
His speeches sparked at least two dissenting cries in the audience, and members of the SNL broadcast looked ashamed, as Variety reports. One man told the media: "There was a deadly silence in the whole studio."
West was called to replace singer Ariana Grande after her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West was puzzled by his performance of the song "I Love It," wearing a Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from Candace Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR THE MINIS."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West “was just himself and that’s amazing.”
"But I choose NOT to take a man (by buying his music or his clothes or by upholding his 'art') whose beliefs are a poisonous ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we're also free," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name and was now formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first developer to change his name, but followed the same path that Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy, had taken.
The fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was originally called Snoop Lyon; music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.
Accusations of attempted murder after knife attack at Belfast restaurant

Police say the incident took place in Balihakamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
Next articleGame of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes distorted view of masculinity
Another Harington became famous as a sword-beating character in the HBO fantasy adventure series about the Middle Ages "Game of Thrones."
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Quito said he thought “something is wrong” and questioned how to deal with the problem of distorted masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
The other, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, admitted he was "strongly touched" by the subject.
“I feel that I am deeply touched by this topic now, and where have we made the mistake of cultivating masculinity?” he asked.
"What are we teaching growing men to do to face such problems?"
Another thinks that television could be responsible for some of this twisted wave of masculinity, as it creates very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is being taught on television or on the street that young people believe they should have this kind of masculinity?
I think this is one of the important questions of our time: how do we change this?
I think I made a mistake with the guys.”
In the interview, he also confirmed that he would not take part in any prehistory or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying "he has enough battlefields and horses."
From November onwards, Kit will be filming Sam Shepard's "True West" in the modern version, a film about the filmmaker and his brother the thief.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones, where he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife in this series, so in this sense, the series gave me a future family and a future life," he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose starred Igrit, the love object of another character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports a 14% increase in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
Health authorities said more than 820,000 people were infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most newly infected people have been sexually transmitted, which is different from the statistics of the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But this has reduced the number of people living with HIV to almost zero, according to representatives of Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, over time, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a sensitive issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually marry women.
Most cases of infection with this disease occur due to inadequate protective measures during such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as a way to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked the Republican senator's data, denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US spokeswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had posted the personal information of three Republican US senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the charges were brought by ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
"A lie, a lie, and once again a despicable lie," Waters said on Twitter.
The revelations reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was released by an unknown person from Capitol Hill as the Senate examined allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came later when the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
"Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address from which the source of these records related to the Waters office was determined and that Waters employee information has been disclosed," the Capitol said.
"These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these fraudulent and bogus allegations is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds evil," Fleischer wrote.
“It says she doesn’t have the self-control to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of things they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
He shouldn't be defending.
He should not question the accuser’s motives.
He should be calm and humble.”
Fleischer appeared to have tried to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is campaigning to replace Waters, also tweeted.
“True, if not a lie,” he wrote.
In its statement, Waters said its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the organizers are identified," she continued, "that they are legally accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees without exception."
"Johnny English Strikes Again" Comedy Review: An Exhausted Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is already a tradition to look for Brexit hints in any British film. The same can be said about the revival of the action spy comedy franchise "Johnny English" - "Johnny English" was launched in 2003, and in 2011 returned to the screens with the comedy "Johnny English Resurrection".
Will this sarcastic auto-defeat about how obviously we have failed become a new opportunity for national exports?
Be that as it may, the incompetent Johnny English has a second chance, with wide eyes and a rubber face, to bring unpleasant truths to the surface.
Of course, this silly secret agent, who, despite his claims to luxury, has acquired some of the qualities of inspector Clouseau, some of Mr. Bean's traits and a little bit of the guy's resemblance, is a reference to the theme of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony, which was used to create the theme of the drama "Cars of Fire."
He is also somewhat based on the character of the traveler and the mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ad.
There are some beautiful moments in this latest film by Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the blade rotor crashed into his helmet.
Atkinson’s comedy talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems breathless and strangely overloaded, especially when serious film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible boldly incorporate elements of comedy.
Humor is like it's more for children than for adults, and the adventures of Johnny English, which I don't like, don't seem as inventive and as purposeful as Atkinson's silent jokes about playing Mr. Bean.
The most common problem is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A hacker has successfully hacked Britain’s top-secret spy network and uncovered the identities of all British spies in the field, sparking an outrage from the agent — Kevin Eldon’s insignificant role.
This is the last drop in the cup of a prime minister, a pompous and cornered character who is already suffering from overwhelming political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Theresa May squeezes everything she can, but in the script there is little good material for that.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people to retire.
This means that Johnny English, who is currently acting as the headmaster of a school in some glamorous institution, but is giving illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent, is going to have to talk to him, and there were some good jokes about the English proposing the School of Rock type spy academy.
The Englishman is sent back to Whitehall to discuss the state of emergency, and there he meets his longtime general Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man linked to a submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays a high-society girl, seems under-exploited.
So Batman and Robin, capable of messing things up in Her Majesty's Secret Service, take action again and meet the fatal beauty Ophelia Buletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
The prime minister is dangerously overwhelmed by the charismatic billionaire who says he can solve Britain's computer problem, Jason Walt, starred as Jake Lacy.
The Englishman and the Bough begin their odyssey: dressed as waiters, they start a fire at a French restaurant, cause chaos on a luxury Volta yacht, and the Englishman begins a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality headphones to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta house.
All stop shots were clearly reserved for this last series, but no matter how pleasant or wild it may be, it's all reminiscent of children's television.
Quite average.
As with other films by Johnny English, I could not help but think: is the British film industry incapable of giving Rowan Atkinson a role that is truly worthy of his talent?
Labour denies making a plan for Britons to work four days a week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but pay a five-day wage.
The party is reported to want executives to share the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, giving their employees one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while bringing home the same amount of pay.
The source says the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to steer the country's development in a worker-friendly direction.
The move to a four-day working week was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to reap the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected by the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week is in line with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to promote the idea, as the Greens also promised during the four-day week of the 2017 general election.
However, this idea is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour party said: "The four-day week is not party policy and it is not considered in the party."
Shadow government spokesman John McDonnell at last week's Labour Party conference took the opportunity to present his vision for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to win back power from “faceless dictators” and “earning hunters” at utility companies.
Such plans by the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not get their full share back, because if they see the wrong done, the Labour government may deduct something.
It also approved plans to include employees in the company's boardroom and to create inclusive equity funds so that 10 per cent of the capital of private sector companies would be transferred to employees and could receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer '60 Minutes' question whether FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
As the FBI is investigating charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on whether to refer him to the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week, raising the question of whether the FBI's findings could affect the opinion of any Republican senators in a way that would no longer support the judge.
Scott Pelley, a correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI might find something that will change their minds.
Senator Kennedy seems to have a looser stance than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy replied.
"As I said when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, when these accusations came up, I called him and said, "Did you do that?"
He responded decisively, firmly, unequivocally."
No one seems to change Graham’s opinion.
"I'm determined for Brett Kavanaugh, there should be some really shocking accusations," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what was there, but I know one thing: Brett categorically denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of what she says can confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t think there will be anything new.”
What is the World Citizens Festival, and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
NEW YORK (AP) — The World Citizen Festival in New York this Saturday is an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars with the equally impressive goal of eradicating world poverty.
For the seventh year in a row, the Citizen of the World Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread the true message of the event’s goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival was launched in 2012 as a follow-up to the Global Project against Poverty, an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a variety of tasks or activities, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or making any other meaningful contribution to raising awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, are the world’s citizens successful in achieving this goal? 12 years remain before the deadline.
Will the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really convince them to demand and urge them to act? Maybe this is just another example of so-called cliktivism, fictitious activism – people think that they will definitely change the situation by signing an online petition or posting on Twitter.
According to the organizers of the World Citizen Festival, since 2011 the movement has registered more than 19 million actions of its supporters to promote a wide range of goals.
Under pressure, they say, world leaders have announced <0x24>37 billion in pledges and policies to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and declarations triggered by the group’s actions, of which at least <0x24>10 billion had already been disbursed or collected.
According to the group’s estimates, the secured funds have already directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of her key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and enforcers that aims to "help children grow up and unleash their full potential". After receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the world's citizens, she pledged to give Rwanda US dollars to help tackle malnutrition in the country.
"With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments and citizens of the world like you, we can make social injustices like malnutrition a thing of the past," said Tracey Ullman, a nutrition power ambassador, at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after receiving 5,000 appeals calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the “Nutrition Power” project, which will carry out nutritional interventions to reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on our website, which asks, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The world’s citizens answer: “This is a long and difficult road – sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, “The Weeknd”, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e – these are some of the artists participating in this year’s event in New York. The event will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy blockade to block Russian energy exports
"If necessary, Washington can use the fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, as well as Middle East markets," Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement.
Zinke says Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially when it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think Russia is meddling in the Middle East because it wants to regulate energy, as it is doing in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve the issue.
"The United States can do this with the fleet, it can make sure that the sea routes are open and it can blockade if necessary, it can make sure that its energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke told attendees at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself the "Voice of Energy Consumers" in the United States.
He then compared Washington’s methods with those of dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were essentially the same.
"The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is to find more or less a counterweight to replace fuel," he said, calling Russia a country whose entire economy depends entirely on fossil fuels.
The announcements came as the Trump administration embarked on a mission to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the alleged inappropriate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said led to Berlin becoming a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has met with hostile reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
Germany's main industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I certainly do not support interference by a third state in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president in 2020
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after midterm elections.
At a meeting at Hollook Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to manage our failed government, and they must go to the top office," she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether to run for president.”
During a meeting in the town hall, Warren rebuked President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm terrified of how Donald Trump treats our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticizes Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "an FBI investigation is definitely needed before the vote".
But a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of voters in Warren's own state believe she should not run for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the likely voters in Massachusetts say the senator should not run for president.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll found that former governor Deval Patrick received more support, with 38 percent supporting his possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Others discussed in the run-up to 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make a formal decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
At Donald Trump's rally, Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic disorder
Track Palin, a 26-year-old who entered military service in September, spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, after a domestic violence incident, he was arrested and charged.
"I see what my son is going through, what he's going through when he gets back into everyday life, so I understand other families who are suffering from PTSD, and the kind of injury our soldiers are getting back with," she said at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said the son and other veterans of the war "are coming back with a little change, they are coming back with a harder heart, they are coming back doubting whether they will receive respect for what their comrades soldiers and pilots and all the other soldiers have given to their country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as preventing reports of domestic violence with guns and drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 States and District of Columbia Oppose New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy to refuse asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the county submitted amicus curiae comments in support of challenging asylum policies, NBC News reported.
The applicant’s full name in the proceedings Grace v. Sessions, initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She says her partner "and members of his criminal gang" have been violent against her, but US authorities rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace-supporting state lawyers have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the U.S. receives a large number of asylum applications, as states plagued by constant gang violence and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "violates decades of national, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that decisions on asylum applications be taken on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an injunction violates this principle," an amicus curiae note said.
In the remark, lawyers also argue that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the country is damaging to the US economy, and that immigrants are more likely to do business and “provide the necessary work services.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop offering asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems (or all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
With the death toll doubled in Palu, a desperate search for survivors has begun.
The situation of the survivors is constantly deteriorating.
"The tension is very high," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, as she calmed her baby's fever-stricken son into the evacuation centre of Palu.
“The fast keeps transporting more and more bodies.
It lacks clean water.”
Residents are returning to their destroyed homes, collecting waterlogged items, and trying to save what they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and damaged 7.5-magnitude earthquake hospitals were packed.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Harry, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, were placed outside the military hospital in Palu, where severe aftershocks continued and hospital patients were treated outdoors.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recounts how the hotel’s fifth-floor room, where he was staying with his wife and daughter, felt a violent earthquake.
There was no time to save others.
I think I broke through the ruins of the wall," Harry told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, followed by silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they are healthy.”
US ambassador accuses China of intimidating propaganda
A week after a four-page ad in an official Chinese newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned China Daily's paid supplement to the state's top-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, and accused China of trying to influence the November 6 U.S. congressional elections.
"Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the U.S. election marks a new stage in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China," U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are waging an escalating trade war and both sides are battling tariffs on each other’s imports.
According to Chinese and US experts, Chinese counter-tariffs were targeted at exporters from Iowa and similar states that supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a former long-term governor of Iowa and one of China’s biggest exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said China was “even more ridiculed by the start of printing propaganda ads in our free press.”
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese authorities have used America's respected freedom of speech and of the press to order a paid advertising message, the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In the meantime, at the local Beijing press booth, you won’t find voices that contradict each other, and you won’t get a real picture of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China’s disturbing economic trajectory, because the press is under the hard foot of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
Branstad also added that "one of China's best-known newspapers has evaded the offer to print" his article, without mentioning which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: Kavanaugh fiasco is deterred by Republican voter
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with multiple sexual harassment charges, the analyst warned it would face a negative response in the upcoming midterm elections, particularly from women.
The situation is very emotional, and many Republicans have already officially said they want to go ahead with the vote.
Such things cannot be taken back later," Syracuse University Maxwell School professor Grant Reeher said in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reecher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute calls for an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will remember it tomorrow and November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive movement MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the senate lobby when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite Dr Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will flow across the board,” Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst and impartial to the news website, said in a statement.
People say she was already strong, and they’re right.
But it could further strengthen positions, especially among undecided women voters in the suburbs and younger 18- to 29-year-olds who, while not liking the president, often simply don’t vote.”
Even before Ford testified in public, when she detailed her allegations of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that if Republicans approved the candidacy, it could cause outrage.
"This has caused a lot of confusion for the Republican Party," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee or the final vote, it's not just about whether Kavanaugh is to be appointed as a judge, it's about how the Republicans managed the situation and how they treated Ford," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats in the election, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be at odds over what to believe after Kavanaugh and Ford’s testimony, even though she has a little more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent believe Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had lied or likely lied in his testimony, and only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Driven by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and the testimony of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, arguing that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 when she was drunk.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party they attended while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
Web inventor plans to launch new internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global network, is developing a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project by this legendary inventor, Inrupt, is a company whose work is based on the Berners-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to take control of the world.
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
“This is an historic moment.”
Solid technology-based app allows people to create their own personal online data store – POD.
It can include lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal or work tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in the same browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and what information can be accessed.
This is what the company calls personal empowerment through data.
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not in talks with Facebook or Google about changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission."
In a statement on Saturday, Berners-Lee said Inrupt’s “mission is to provide trading energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the durability and quality of the new Solid-based network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the Web Consortium at Massachusetts Technological University.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate about internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernardas Vanbas – priest awarded with the Victorian Cross in the First World War
On the 100th anniversary of his birth in his hometown honored the only Anglican cleric who was awarded the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I.
Lieutenant-Colonel Pastor Bernard Bath earned the award on September 29, 1918, during the Belenglis and Lucurs offensive.
Sadly, after four days, the pastor was shot dead by a sniper, leaving him unaware that he had been awarded the highest British military award.
During the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, the memory stone was uncovered by two grandchildren.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vanbas, said the discovery of the stone 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat was "wonderfully symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, a lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Kent “in a very thick fog, with guns and machine guns burning violently.”
He then rushed to the firing line and "extremely galantically" led the line forward, then attacked the cannon alone and killed three squad fighters.
Lieutenant Colonel B. Vann was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vandana, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something that can never be matched, but also something that inspires humility.”
After a parade hosted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother Dr. James Vannas laid the wreath.
Micheal Bath said he was honored to take part in the parade, adding: "The valor of a real hero is shown by the support that so many people will give."
MMA fans didn’t go to bed all night to see Bellator 206, but had to be content with Pig Pepa
Imagine: you don’t go to bed all night to see the packed Bellator 206, but eventually you don’t get to see the main spectacle.
There were 13 fights on the San Jose poster, six of them on the main card and broadcast live in the UK all night on Channel 5.
As Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the UK audience was stunned by the break-up of Pig Pepa.
Some viewers were not impressed, to put it mildly, because it was precisely because of this fight that they did not go to bed until early in the morning.
On Twitter, one supporter called the replacement of the broadcast a children's cartoon "some sort of morbid joke."
“According to government regulations, at 6 a.m., this content was inappropriate and the children’s program had to be turned on,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said in response to the broadcast.
“Yes, Piggy Pep.”
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust the timetables to take account of viewers in the UK.
"When I think of repetition, I think we could probably do it," Coker said.
“But at that time it’s 6 a.m., Sunday, and we wouldn’t be able to fix it until Sunday in our time, Monday in their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, after the change of the broadcast, a lot of messages were exchanged, not all of which were friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
No, it is a matter of power.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do. We wanted to give more to the fans, but we just didn't succeed.
It's a failed situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels Incompetent About His Sexual Orientation
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, said he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he only realized in elementary school that he wasn’t the same as everyone else.
For the first time in Lauren Laverne’s “Radio 4” show, Desert Island Discs, he said he started talking publicly about gay rights because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a father, it was not so important to win the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent host of the long-running program, resigned from her job for several months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, which asked guests to imagine they were heading to a deserted island, Daley said growing up he felt inferior to everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said: “Until now, this sense of triviality and otherness has been the stimulus that has given me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove himself worth something to avoid letting people around him down when they finally learn about his sexual orientation.
The winner of two Olympic bronze medals became a high-profile LGBT activist and, as part of this year’s Commonwealth Games, took the opportunity to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had started talking about it in public because he thought he was lucky enough to live an open life without any consequences and wanted to give others the same hope.
The three-time world champion said it was a surprise for him to fall in love with a man he met in 2013, Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
Delay said that when you’re so young — he was only 14 at his first Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later — it’s hard to find someone of the same age but with the same highs and lows.
Since the couple became parents to their son Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, Daley's perspective has changed completely, he said.
"If you had listened last year, I would have said that the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal," he said.
But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His name is the same as that of his grandfather Roberto, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Anto T. Daley, the father, was unwilling to accept death, and one of his last questions was whether he had already bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, which he was going to watch while sitting in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to be in the front row," Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he is not invulnerable,” Daley said.
A year later, he competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I just knew I had been dreaming about it my whole life — jumping into the water with the local Olympic spectators watching — there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the selection of the first song for the show, Heather Small’s “Proud,” which echoed his feelings while preparing for the Olympics and still pleasantly horrifies his skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British Summer Time.
Former Mickelson missed Saturday's Ryder Cup on the bench
Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he will need to improve his form to avoid becoming a failure.
Mickelson, who has been playing for the 12th time every two years, was seated on a bench by Captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's four-year event.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case in the United States, five times the main winner spent part of the day on a support team, and the rest he perfected his technique on the field in order to correct the inconvenient errors.
Even at the heights of his career, the 48-year-old isn’t the ideal player on the tight Le Gold National, where a long stretch of rough grass is particularly unfavorable for inaccurate kicks.
Also, as if the pitch itself weren’t scary enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson will play against Francesco Molinari, a top British Open champion who has won all four games this week with novice Tommy Fleetwood.
If the four-pointers get a good start on the upcoming 12-piece match, Mickelson's match could be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, but he probably could not have said otherwise.
"He perfectly understood the role he was playing today, clapped my back and said with a hug that he was ready to play tomorrow," Furyk said.
He doesn’t lack self-confidence.
He is on the list of the most glorious athletes and has given a lot to these teams both in the past and this week.
I had no idea he was going to play two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out like this, so we decided to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Fald’s record to become the most-playing athlete in the Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never reached his personal record highs.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, but Furyk says his presence has also brought intangible benefits to the team.
"He's cheerful, sarcastic, witty, he likes to laugh at people and he's a great guy who's fun to be in the team room with," he said.
“I think it was fun for the younger players to compete with him this week, too, it was good to look at it.
It brings so much more than a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead in the final Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough fight.
The Danish athlete made his debut in 1997 at the Valderama, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only crossed the finish line with a mere 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We constantly remind ourselves that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderama, where we won, but barely," said Bjorn (pictured), who watched the 2018 show's victory with a score of 5:3 on Friday and 10:6 on Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the team members that it’s not over yet.
You will need all your strength tomorrow.
Go and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal – to try to win this prize – and we have to pursue it consistently.
I have always said I trust the 12 players on our side, but we know who is on the other side, the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with his players' performance on a challenging field, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to pre-empt myself in any way.
Tomorrow is going to be a different kind of hair.
Tomorrow will be an individual game, that’s different.
It’s great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re alone on the pitch, you’re tested for limits on your ability to play golf.
This is something that players need to instill in themselves – tomorrow they will have to squeeze everything out of themselves.
Now I’m going to have to break up with my partner, and he’s going to have to squeeze everything out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points each.
Furyke himself experienced both sides of the last day's surprises because Brookline was on the winning team before Europe performed the miracle of Medina and turned them into losers."
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players to prepare for their final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but look forward to a quick start, like you’ve seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, the middle matches become very tense.
"We formed our team accordingly and released the players in a way that we, you know... are trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas will be tasked with retaliating against Rory McIlroy in a top-level match, with Europeans leading Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"I picked these guys in this order because I think they're going to make it through the game," Bjorn said of his choice for the singles.
The delivery of a new German warship has been postponed again.
The latest frigate of the German navy was supposed to be in place in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but will not be seen until at least next year, according to local press, due to perishable systems and sharp price rises.
According to an army spokesman quoted by the newspaper Die Zeit, the delivery of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading new frigate-class frigate ship of Baden-Württemberg, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of the ambitious project has been overshadowed by the problems that have plagued the ship.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the navy back in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is expected to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and certain sensitive technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Another important feature is longer maintenance intervals, which would allow the latest frigate to sail away from home ports for up to two years.
But because of the endless delays, according to Die Zeit, high-tech warships, which are said to allow Germany to divert military power to overseas territories, will become obsolete before they can be used.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy formally refused to take the ship and returned it to the Hamburg-based Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship already delivered to the builder.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German press mentions some major software and hardware defects that would have made the ship useless for a military mission.
Software flaws are particularly important, as Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be managed by a crew of around 120 seafarers, half the size of the older Bremen-class frigate.
In addition, it turned out that this ship is far too heavy, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the navy to implement various improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is estimated to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the entire project – along with the perishable technical equipment, including crew training – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion).
The problems plaguing the latest frigate have become particularly significant following recent warnings that the power of the German navy is dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the navy was in fact "under pressure to run out of usable ships".
The officer said the problems had been compounded over time because the old ships had already been decommissioned, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the frigate of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study, carried out at a Scottish Highland estate, aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behavior of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
Researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will track dwarf bitches, soprano bitches, brown-eared bitches and water mice in the Vester Ross Inverev Gardens.
In certain areas of the territory will be placed special recorders, which will allow to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
Staff and volunteers of the National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of all audio recordings will determine the frequency of signals emitted by bats and the activity of one or another type.
A map and report of habitable habitats will then be created to help form a detailed picture of behaviour on a landscape-wide scale.
National Trust for Scotland (NTS) conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat maintenance, such as grassland creation, as well as how forested areas can best be maintained to suit bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development works that affect hatcheries and destroy residential areas.
Wind turbines and lightning are also a threat, as are flycatchers, some chemicals used to process building materials, as well as domestic cats that hunt.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, catching prey during night hunting helps ears more than eyes.
Bats accurately determine the location of insects or obstacles in the flight trajectory by sophisticated echolocation.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is extremely responsible for bats.
Ten trained experts work there to conduct regular investigations, hatchery inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Manor supervisor David Thompson says that the territory of the manor is ideal for them.
"We have a great place for bats in Threave Manor," he said.
– We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and great areas to live in.
But we still don’t know much about bats, so working here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He emphasizes that it is very important to check for the presence of bats before starting maintenance work on the territory, because accidental destruction of one hatchery can kill up to 400 females and juveniles, which can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is forbidden to kill, tease or disturb them, as well as to destroy their hatcheries.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official with the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, urged the public to help save the bats.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don’t even know how many native species are doing.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Accusations: Lawyers Will Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape accusations against him "a lie" and said people using his name "seek fame".
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that he paid the alleged woman <0x24>375,000 to silence her.
Speaking to 142 million followers in a live Instagram video hours after the charges were announced, the 33-year-old criticized the reports as "false."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they are saying today is “fakes,” said the five-time Ballon d’Or winner looking at the camera.
They want to use my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous, they want to say my name, that’s part of my job.
I'm a happy person, it's okay," the athlete added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they called “unacceptable public disclosure of the allegations about private space.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said he would seek "moral damages of an amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, perhaps one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in a Palms casino and hotel apartment in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents filed in Nevada's Clark County Court, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room where he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a "99 percent good man" who had been betrayed by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that the couple had had sexual intercourse, but said they were contractual.
Mayorga also said she went to the police and her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to cancel the deal because she continues to feel traumatised by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was walking from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juventus with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: UK would forever regret losing car makers
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would “forever regret” losing its status as world car leader after Brexit.
He added that he was concerned about Toyota’s UK subsidiary’s claim to the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would temporarily stop production at Burnaston’s plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that a no-deal Brexit would mean job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, last year produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will have to stop production at our factory," said Toyota CEO Burnastone Marvin Cooke.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, have also voiced concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and its implications for international trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the main concern is the threat that will be posed to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is up and running when needed, as parts for custom-made cars come from both UK and EU-based suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, which the industry says could cause delays or shortages.
Toyota said it could not keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, which would stop production.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “prepared precisely to avoid such border checks.”
"We need a deal, we want the best deal that allows us not only to enjoy success today, but also to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“Not only Toyota, but also other car manufacturers’ data shows that it is essential to continue to benefit from a very successful supply chain system.”
Toyota could not say for how long production would be halted, but warned that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs in the long term.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is responsible for Unite’s trade union meetings, said members of his union were increasingly worried: “I’m telling you from experience that if these jobs are lost, they’ll never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible framework for future relations with the EU."
According to the White House, Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
"As the fight for a Supreme Court Justice candidate continues, a very important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week," the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, Trump’s ties to Russia and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller's independence, has fuelled rumours in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But as reports of his resignation flashed, he went to the White House last Monday.
The meeting with Trump, which was at the United Nations in New York at the time, will take place on Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein, and the meeting was later postponed to avoid coincidence with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's allegations within a week, again postponing the vote in the Senate.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “Its date is not fixed. It may take place this week, but given all the events related to the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to report the news to the press."
Some reporters would disagree: Sanders hasn’t held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that press conferences are rarely held because he doesn't like "viewer-focused" TV journalists, but added, "I have to accept the fact that they're looking for viewer-focused effects."
He said he would talk to the press more often.
"The president answers questions more often than any previous president," she said, adding, without providing any evidence, "we reviewed these statistics."
Sanders said press conferences would be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this, and you have seen this happen many times over the last few weeks, and the press conferences will be replaced by your direct communication with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, attending public hearings or press conferences with honorable guests.
Single-person press conferences are rare.
The president’s free and sometimes bizarre appearance before journalists this week in New York may have explained why.
Scottish Health Minister writes to EU workers over Brexit concerns
The health minister wrote a letter to Scottish NSS workers from the EU expressing the country’s gratitude and desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applications for settled status for EU citizens working in its public service remit.
In her letter, Freeman said: “In the summer, UK-EU withdrawal negotiations have continued and are approaching the decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know you're all very worried right now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the functioning of the healthcare system to the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie has an emergency surgery.
Christion Abercrombie, the defender of the Tennessee State Tigers, lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday at 31:27, Tennessean journalist Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the side line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medics at the sideline gave Abercrombie a breath of oxygen, then put it on a stretcher and sent it for further investigation.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris of Nashville, Tennessee, told the WSMV that Abercrombie’s operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center had been completed.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type and extent of the injury," and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it occurred.
Abercrombie has officially moved from Illinois to play for Tennessee State in his first season.
Before leaving the game, he rebounded five times on Saturday, bringing the total number of rebounds he scored in a season to 18.
Foreign buyers of UK real estate will have to pay higher stamp duty
Under new Tory plans, foreign buyers of real estate in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp duty, and the extra money received will be used to help the homeless.
This move will reduce the risk posed by the successful Corbyn campaign to attract young voters.
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on non-tax payers in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes it can raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May announces higher stamp duty for foreign buyers of UK real estate and will use the extra money to help homeless people.
By promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners, the move is expected to reduce the risk posed by Jeremy Corbyn’s successful campaign to attract young voters.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on non-taxpayers and businesses in the UK, and the additional money received will be used to promote the government's campaign against homelessness.
The additional fee – paid in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for buying a second home or a house for rent – can reach as much as three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London’s newly built real estate is bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it more difficult for first-time home buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, so many rich neighborhoods of the country and especially the capital have become ghost towns.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in court fees to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused big construction companies of quickly buying up land but not using it to keep real estate prices high, and urged May to address Britain’s housing shame by scrapping quotas on affordable homes.
Corbyn has announced several eye-catching housing reforms, including rent controls and a no-fault eviction ban.
In addition, he wants to give more power to municipal councils to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said that as prime minister I would aim to bring back the British dream that every new generation must have a better life.
This means that we need to fix our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in the UK and companies established abroad can buy houses as easily as hard-working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of housing has become almost impossible, and the threat of homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland chief executive Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland’s national team’s top manager someday.
The 42-year-old Scotsman likes the challenge of reviving North-East, which is now in third place in the first league and three points behind the first-placed club.
After taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championships last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I went to B and it was over," Ross told the BBC's Scotland's Sportsound.
“But when I was a kid, I grew up at Hamden Stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish national games, and that has always attracted me to come back.
This will only happen if I manage the club well.”
Ross's Sunderland was led by Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Previously rejecting the Barnsley and Ipswich Town bids, the former Alloa Athletic chief said he wasn’t worried about taking on the role of such prominent executives at such a big club.
“My success will now be judged by the answer to the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
"By structure and conditions, this club is definitely a member of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I'm sure I'll think that I've been successful here until I get the club back in the league."
Ross's managerial career lasts only three years. Before that, he worked as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and replaced Hearts coaches for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa rebound to the third division, and turned the threatened St Mirren into champions the following season.
Ross says he's more satisfied now than he's ever felt in his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"This change was probably radical," he recalls of his leadership at Alloa.
“I really believe that it’s better to lead than to play.
That sounds strange because I was successful, I made a lot of money and I was happy with the successes.
Playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of problems to be overcome every week.
And now it’s not easy – work stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
As an adult, I always felt like I was on my own sleigh, but leadership is the most rewarding thing to do.”

Studies have shown that the best time for a pint of beer is on Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heatwave has boosted the incomes of poor Britain's pubs, but has added to the burden on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that in July, the sales of groups of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants, revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, the business consultancy that compiled the data, said: “The unending sunshine and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that the trend in July was similar to that in June, when pub revenues grew by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were hit even harder than before.
In June, sales in restaurants fell by 1.8 percent, and in July the situation became even worse.
Pubs and bars earning the main income from the sale of beverages were undoubtedly the best, and their sales grew more strongly than the decrease in restaurants.
Although not as bad as restaurant companies, pubs that receive the main income from food sales have also been hit by the sun.
People just want to go out for a drink.
In well-run pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent this month, while food sales dropped 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM, a leisure and hospitality sector analysis firm, said: “These results continue the trend seen since late April.
When it comes to catering facilities, the weather and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be key factors.
Thus, it is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle. True, a 4.8 per cent drop in sales will be particularly painful for a number of years, as it will contribute to continued cost-related pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the companies that receive the most income from food trade. Time will tell whether the milder temperatures felt in August will provide the necessary respite."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new locations, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the development of brand-owned networks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracker for the UK’s pub, pub and restaurant sector and its guidelines, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion.
One in five children have social media accounts hidden from their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, have social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students reveals an increase in fake Insta pages
The news heightened fears of sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they need to show a basic account for their parents
One in five children – some just 11 years old – create secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta pages, a link to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news heightened fears of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they use a censored main account to show parents, but also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, found out that the teenage girl insisted: "Rape me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (CIA) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two accounts, with half of these students admitting to hiding accounts.
MDC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “The fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them is alarming.”
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle was elected as a consultant director at the General Annual Meeting of the Scottish Sports Council’s governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish track and field athlete and chairwoman, and Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of the many international experiences she has gained over the past decade.
“Eilidha has earned great respect across the Scottish, UK and global sporting community and we have no doubt that her inclusion on the board will be of great benefit to Scottish sport,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very keen to serve as the voice of the athletes and I hope that I will really contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland.”
The 200-meter and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Games and the four Olympic gold medals in total, now appearing as a regular BBC expert, prevented the American from walking after a brief ischemia attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell if and to what extent I will recover.
It was necessary to work until exhaustion, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!”
Breast pump advertising, which compares mothers with cows, received different ratings on the Internet
The company that makes breast pumps has received different opinions about its advertising, which compares nursing mothers with dairy cows.
To mark the launch of what has been described as the world’s first silent portable breast lift, consumer technology company Elvie has launched an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to showcase the freedom that the new breast pump gives nursing mothers.
In a barn full of hay, four real mothers dance according to an audio recording in which they hear, for example, the words: "Yes, I milk myself, but I do not see any tail" and "If you do not notice, this is not the udder, this is my breasts."
"Take it out, take it out, take it out, feed it to babies, take it out, take it out, milk my beauties."
However, advertising on the company's Facebook page has sparked an online dispute.
The video, which was viewed 77,000 times and received several hundred comments, reacted in different ways, with many saying that it overlooked the horrors of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to promote this product is a very bad decision.
Like us, they must conceive and give birth in order to produce milk, but their newborns are taken away from them a few days after giving birth.”

Another commented: “It is understandable that this traumatizes both the mother and the newborn.
But why not use it to promote a breast pump for mothers who don't take their babies away?"
Another added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding.”
Another commentator defended the ad – one woman admitted that she found the song “very fun”.
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would buy it if I still had food.
When I cut off the milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant," <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> wrote one.
Another commented: “This fun ad is for mothers who milk themselves (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
It is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were all shocked by inconspicuous breast pumps in bras.
The idea of the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breastfeed claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump does not emit any sound, has no wires or tubes and fits seamlessly in the nursing bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, or even leave the house when the milk is withdrawn.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and executive creative director, commented: “The Elvie breast pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
When we compared nursing women to dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the issue of breast-feeding and all the challenges it poses, while having fun and showing as much as possible the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie breast pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Martha Jakubowski’s collection, the mother of two demonstrated the product on the catwalk.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp on Texas border
The number of people crossing the border has remained broadly unchanged over the course of a month, but the number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, in part because the Trump administration's tough rhetoric and policies have made it more difficult to accommodate them with guardians.
Traditionally, most of the foster parents themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared that applying for child custody would risk the possibility of staying in the country.
With the announcement in June by the federal government that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk has increased further.
Last week, Matthew Albence, chief immigration and customs officer, told Congress that the institution had detained dozens of people seeking custody of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“Nearly 80 percent of these people — guardians or members of their families — live in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to persecute these persons,” Albence said.
According to the staff of the shelter, in order to consider cases of children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules, according to which some children must appear in court within a month of their detention, and not within 60 days, as was usual in the past.
Many will try to defend their request for legal status before an immigration judge by videoconferencing rather than coming in person.
Those who are declared ineligible will be quickly deported.
According to the shelter’s staff and reports from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Defenders say this is even more worrisome in large institutions such as the Tornill Shelter, where the size increases the chances of overlooking signs that the child is suffering.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate many of the traumas they have already suffered.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to return home despite eight years of war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian soil under the pretext of counter-terrorism were illegal and would be treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem said Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes, was close to an end to the war on terror.
He said Damascus will not stop fighting this holy struggle until we have eradicated both terrorist groups and any illegally staying foreigners in all parts of Syria.
There are some 2,000 US troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Speaking about the problem of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are good. At the same time, he accused some Western countries of spreading unfounded fears that discourage refugees from returning.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return," he said.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will only receive reconstruction aid once Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has paved the way for faster progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces targeting a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, which would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a committee made up of government and opposition members soon to draft Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions under which the Syrian government will participate in the committee, limiting its work to reviewing the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why will Trump be elected for a second term?
Under this logic, Trump would be elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers would expect, his presidency ends prematurely with impeachment and a scandal.
Without a doubt, this would be the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!
There are no signs of spectator fatigue yet.
Since 2014, CNN’s best-time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show is number one in cable television rankings, with 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
"It's a fire that attracts people because we don't understand something," says Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Descendent" about the secretary of the Cabinet who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the House of Congress.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Funny Parts Only and a Few Unpleasant Truths about Secretly Entering a Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"He said, 'He makes me laugh,'" Scovell said.
Chaos is valuable in that it cheers up.

In a tense midterm election to the House of Representatives, money is pouring in from around the world.
Not surprisingly, the reorganization of congressional districts, which resulted in two members of the House trying to win the same position, flooded Pennsylvania’s 17th district with money.
The newly redrawn Pittsburgh suburbs have drawn Democrat Conor Lamb into the march, winning his place in a special election in another district last spring.
Lamb competes with Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's former 12th constituency, much of which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties had been falsified in favor of Republicans in violation of the constitution.
In the new 17th constituency, major party financial institutions -- the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DKCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NPC) -- ran into campaign finance.
Lamb gained fame in Pennsylvania when he narrowly won the March special election in the 18th congressional district.
Republicans took the place for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning 20 points in the constituency.
Political scientists gave Democrats a bit of an advantage.
U.S. Considered Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, But Then Calm Down
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, but that there was virtually no backlash from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and, until the partners moved the Trump Organization leadership, had a hotel in the country.
"Due to recent decisions to disapprove Taiwan State Department officials have decided to recall heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama," department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions are being considered only for El Salvador, which received roughly <0x24>140 million in US aid in 2017 as well as drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, which would include a reduction in financial aid and individual visa restrictions, would have been painful for a Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
In the run-up to internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity after a similar meeting last year, seen as an important step forward in preventing migrants from reaching the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
"To show the importance the administration attaches to this gathering, Vice President Mike Pence is now on the speaker list for the conference scheduled for mid-October," the diplomats said.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no reprimands or penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesperson declined to comment to Bolton on the details of the discussion, which were told by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an outsider analyst close to the administration, who also spoke if his anonymity is preserved.

Next, it is inevitable to wait for special adviser Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice — his very strong evidence now available in public archives.
Mueller is also speculating on whether the Trump campaign was carried out in secret cooperation with Russia, which is undermining our elections.
If Congress were to change hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution—at the same time as he prepares to stand up again against the electorate, and perhaps, finally, against the commission of officials.
There’s a lot of “if” here, and I’m not saying that the end of Trump is inevitable, just like its European counterparts.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will determine whether the battle will last for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler, all it took was for the West to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent a massacre that would take several years to come.
History unfolds around such fundamental turning points, when the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or paused.
The Americans are now at a number of crucial turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who determines the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein's troubles began when the newspaper reported last year that an official had offered to record the president secretly and considered him unfit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times’ story is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh proves to be incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite conclusive allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, this candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court?”
And, finally, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections, which will force Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy is at risk of a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe that we will keep them.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in the house where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later I was sent to light sabbath candles on a table with a swastika.
When I have such a legacy, how can I look at our future in a non-optimistic way?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers battle with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that if they win a spectacular match against the Austrians earlier this month in Spain, they could be in a strong position to leave Group G.
Due to his mid-to-middle knee injury, Graham Dorrans was only able to appear for the first time this season in a 2:2 race against Villarreal, but he hopes the Rangers can use this score as a springboard for more important goals.
"We had a good result because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old.
“We started with the belief that we would achieve something, and we ended with something.
Maybe we could have been better at the end, but overall the game wasn’t bad.
They probably played better in the first half, and we got better in the second half and showed who we were.
Thursday will be another big day for the European League.
I hope that we can get three points. The game will be difficult, because in the last competition their result was excellent. But I have no doubt that with the support of the spectators we can get ahead and achieve a good result.
“Last year was really hard – what happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope that we can move forward now, forget about last season and play well.”
Because of this fear of retirement savings, a woman suffers from insomnia
Although they clearly imagined what kind of care they would like to receive, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their kids.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of nationwide life insurance.
This is where we need to start.
Talk to your mate and your children: If you do not inform them of your wishes in advance, your family will not be prepared to take care of you.
Discuss where and what care you would like to receive with an advisor and family, as these factors may be important to predict costs.
Invite a financial advisor. The advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for these expenses.
You can choose to pay for long-term care by means of a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy, or by insuring your assets for as long as you have the money.
Prepare legal documents. Prevent legal disputes with documents that allow you to be protected.
Designate a trusted person to take care of your medical care and ensure that the professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think about the power to take care of your finances.
You should choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the bills are paid if you become incapacitated.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
“At least 384 people died when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday,” officials said.
Due to the destruction of communications, emergency services were unable to obtain any data from Dongala Regency, a site north of Palu, close to the 7.5-magnitude quake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palu.
Here are some of the most important facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi.
With a population of about 379,800 in 2017, Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency stretching along the coastline of more than 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regency, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population of around 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic pillars of the central province of Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, although it is concentrated mainly in Moroval on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the past century.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, a tsunami struck the western city of Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia, located on a seismically active ring of fire in the Pacific Ocean, is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a major quake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several strong quakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island.
In 2006, a 6.8 magnitude quake struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a 7.6 magnitude quake struck near Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
In 2010, a 7.5-magnitude quake shook one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters in length that wiped out dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
In 2016, a slight earthquake in Aceh devastated Pyidie Jaya's Regency and caused panic as people remembered how things were devastated by the terrible 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong quakes shook Indonesia’s tourist-rich island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the coast.
Saraha Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Saraha Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
An Alaska police report released on Saturday said the 29-year-old was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and resistance to detention.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he seized her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin was returned to pre-trial detention in Mat-Su and released on a <0x24>500 bail.
"On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he claimed to be completely innocent when asked for an excuse," the network said.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, meaning he can be jailed for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, a day in prison and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police and reported the alleged assault.
The case is currently being considered by the Alaska Veterans Court.
He was charged in January 2016 with assaulting his home, preventing him from reporting a domestic violence crime and holding a gun while drunk.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for linking her son's cruel behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami kills hundreds of people
At least 384 people were killed in the tsunami that hit Indonesia’s Sulawesi island on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake occurred near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of the tsunami are being shared on social media.
The tsunami hit the coast after hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for New York terror suspect
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of being involved in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
A 30-year-old Saipov is suspected of renting a truck from Home Depot on October 31 and attacking a bicycle path along a western highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists while driving along the path.
Prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and caused serious bodily harm, according to a statement in the southern New York county of his intention to seek the death penalty.
According to the court document, both of these indictees can carry the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury of attendees issued a 22-point indictment against Saipov, covering eight charges of murder involving extortion (usually by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases) and an allegation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say the attack was very well planned and premeditated, which Saipov described as disgusting, cruel and immoral.
"As a result of the actions of Sayfull Habibullaevich Saipov, the following families and friends were injured, injured and lost loved ones: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveso, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darreno Drake, Ariel Erlijo, Hernano Ferruchio, Hernano Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Dalemando"
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last death penalty case in New York’s Southern District was a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution was in 1953 in a New York federal case against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two years after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek national, did not regret his actions immediately after the attack or several months later.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack by videos of the Islamic State (ISIS) that he watched on his phone.
Police said he also asked for the Islamic State flag to be hung in the hospital ward.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal state-funded defenders, said they were clearly disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of pleading guilty and serving life in prison without an opportunity to be released will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory lawmaker says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage pledged to mobilize the nation’s army during a protest at the Tory conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the heat of Eurosceptics, and one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have left if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the difficulties May faces in trying to unite the divided pro-EU ranks have been exposed by pro-EU Tories who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
She finds it difficult to carry out her Chequers-agreed compromise plan when she is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted it would try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostile reaction and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package or chaos.
Bone said at a "Leave Means Leave" rally in Solihale that he wanted to thwart Chequers' plan.
He argued that Farage should have been an equal partner and should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had led, we would have already left the EU," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan."
He said: “We did not fight in world wars to obey others.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Bone denied the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstrations and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular among members of our party and activists who take to the streets and, above all, vote for us.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a critical statement, May added: “Prime Ministers keep their posts when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians must be made to feel the heat if they betray a 2016 referendum decision.
"Now it is a question of our trust, the trust of our nation and of our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, so we're here today to tell them we're not going to let them get away with it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which has almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilising the army of this nation, which has brought us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Opponents of Brexit marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
When the group was formed this weekend, a group of activists waved banners saying "Tories against Brexit".
Labour leader Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives over the security problems they faced with the party's app at the start of the conference.
"These are people who say they can deploy IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus plus, for frictionless borders and for free trade with Ireland," he said.
“This is a total farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe said the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November, beating GOP state spokesman Geoff Diehl, one of the leaders of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was predicted that it will be able to compete with the short-term in 2020.
Ever since Trump became president, a Saturday afternoon event in Holloway was her 36th meeting with voters using the format of a public meeting with the public.
One participant asked if she planned to take part in the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to repair the broken government, and that it was up to the women to lead it.
Suspect in LSU Sims Shooting Case Arrested
Police in the Louisiana city of Baton Rouge said Saturday they had arrested a suspect accused of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested.
Police released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help to identify the man.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and died near a Southern University campus early Friday.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul reported Saturday that Wayde Sims had been shot in the head and died of his injuries.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, had a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
When Simpson was arrested, he was imprisoned by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games last season, 10 of which started in the top five, averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to world champion when team orders him to win Sebastian Vettel
When Walter Bott defeated Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying race on Saturday, it became immediately clear that Mercedes' instructions would be crucial in the race.
Starting in first place, Bott made a great start and, defending his position in the first two rounds, almost left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the two-walled garage, left Hamilton, and he returned to the race at the tail of the group, so it was fatal.
The Mercedes went into the two-part garage after the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after almost contactless action when the Ferrari driver, after a double manoeuvre to maintain his position in the third turn, reluctantly freed the inner side of the track.
Max Verstappen, who is celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back of the line, but at the end of the first lap he was seventh.
He was the fastest driver in most of the race, as he drove without changing tires to be as fast as possible in the finish line, bypassing Kimi Raikkonen and finishing fourth.
Finally, in lap 44, he turned to the two-part garage, but in the remaining eight lap he was unable to raise the pace, and Raikkonen crossed the finish line fourth.
“Walter had a tough day because he had a great weekend and when he was asked to skip me, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team did a great job and won the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a meeting with people on Saturday over her persistent denial of the leak of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In a speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly name Ford's testimony to the Senate Law Committee, but said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are wicked, indecent and unjust.
"What could have happened and is actually happening in the Senate in recent days, when you see anger, when you see people are angry, wicked, indecent and unjust," he said.
“When you see the official statements and the leaks and then you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer to the question, did she leak the document? "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Certainly not.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Whether we leaked... no, we didn't," he added, depicting the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July, which was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee: "I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations and I did not leak her story."
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I did as she asked."
At a meeting with people on Saturday night, he said, "You know, it was really bad body language.
She may not have leaked, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court justice candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said the Democrats had used the accusations to their advantage.
"They are determined to take back power by whatever means are necessary.
You see rudeness and indecency; they don't care what they hurt or what they have to go through to get power and control," the president's speech was quoted as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against the Dundee Giants.
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday and won the match against Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5:3.
The Giants made an early breakthrough with two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were evening out before Dwyer again led the Giants forward.
Francois Bouchard of Dundee evened out the score, but then two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured a victory.
Adam Keefe's men suffered their third defeat in the Elite League this season, after defeating Dundee 2:1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the team's fourth game this season, with the Giants winning three previous games.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendall McFaull passed, and four minutes later Beauvilliers doubled the lead after David Rutherford passed.
In the hard-won match, Sullivan returned the arena owners to the game with a goal of 13:10, and after passing Matt Marquardt, Cownie evened out the score at 15:16.
Dwyer arranged for the Giants to take the first break in the lead, and at the end of the first half he scored his second goal of the evening.
With a numerical lead, the team regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the score 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen take the lead for the first time in a match at the end of the second half, and secured the victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, will meet Milton Keynes at home next Friday.
Flight Director Killed to Help Hundreds of Airplane Passengers Escape Earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was named a hero when he was killed helping a plane with several hundred passengers take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are believed to be missing after Friday's powerful earthquake that triggered the tsunami.
The area continues to be shaken by strong aftershocks and many people are trapped in the ruins of the town of Palu.
While colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the oscillating control tower at Mutiara Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed at his place of work to help the 6,321-flight Batik Air, which was already on the runway at the time, safely take off.
Then, thinking that the air traffic control tower was collapsing, he jumped out of it.
He later died in hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We flew him by helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is extremely painful news for us," he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands as the country’s disaster relief agency says the cities of Dangala, Sigismund and Boutong are hard to reach.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as many of the victims are still under the rubble and cannot be reached," spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six metres high have devastated the city of Palu, where mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute, the ambulances bring casualties.
Lack of clean water.
Self-service shops are being robbed everywhere."
Janis Gelfand, head of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help survivors, but we don’t know what we’ll find there.
This is a tragedy, but the situation could get worse.”
Indonesian President Jok Widod arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight that ended the plane crash in the Micronesian Pacific Lagoon now says one person is missing, although it said all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they had no knowledge of a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuko Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before it reached the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane failed to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from very low ground.
"It was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to make it to emergency exits in a sinking and lumbar-flooded plane.
He said the flight attendants were in a state of panic and screaming, while he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said its sailors, repairing a nearby pier, also helped rescue people carried aboard an inflatable boat to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres.
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in Papua New Guinea-registered airline accidents over the past two decades, but none belonged to Air Niugini.
An analyst described the sequence of events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office set out the facts in a repeat case on Saturday against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an intelligence forensic analyst.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to bring together the movement of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated Tellis was with Chamber on the night of her death, which contradicts previous statements.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tell told the truth, saying he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was lying "because his truck was in Nashville."
Another mismatch was that Tell said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Cell phone records show they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tell deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin presenting its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would be referred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
The Hip-Hop trio wants to change the negative attitude towards the genre by spreading positive messages through their music.
The High Breed in Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social issues.
They want to go back to the origins of hip hop and popularize conscious hip hop again.
Actors such as The Fugees and Common have recently been revived in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Yet another black man?
New York nanny sues couple after being fired for 'racist' tweet
A New York nanny sued the couple for dismissing them for discrimination after receiving a message from a mother complaining that she was "another black woman" to the wrong address.
The couple denies being racists and called the lawsuit a "rape".
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was upset when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEE, ANOTHER BLACK," Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
She was sent twice, not to her husband, but to Mr Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman was embarrassed when she realized she had acted negligently and fired Ms. Maurice, arguing that the previous babysitter, who was an African-American, had done her job badly and had hoped to have a Filipino instead.
Ms Maurice was paid for one working day and sent home by Uber.
Maurice now sues the couple for compensation for their dismissal and seeks as much as <0x24>350 a day for living and working in the client’s home for a half-year period, for which she was initially hired without a contract.
"I want to show them that these things cannot be done," she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know this is discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by denying it, saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice because they feared they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasc told the Post.
“Would you trust your children to someone you were impolite to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't."
Plasc equated the lawsuit with "rape", saying the wife had had a baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to judge this?
This is not a very nice behavior," added the investment banking specialist.
While the case was pending, the media rushed to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared readers would not understand the talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel like someone else’s place is reading the book for the first time before it’s published.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's enormous success."
Saying her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before finding inspiration to write a children’s book about a teddy bear, wouldn’t have been too upset if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release a year after his father’s death was both pleasant and sad.
Referring to Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important family member," she added that the father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was quite a calm person and didn't like to brag," she said.
“Since Paddington was so much like him, he felt like he had a child who had achieved something: you’re proud of him, even though that’s not really your job.
I think he had a similar view of Paddington's success story.
Although it was his work and a product of his imagination, he always dedicated his work to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors never managed to save her life.
"Nad kept calling and said that the condition was really bad and she was not expected to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nado, who called to tell me that she had two minutes to live and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I said to her, “Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medications given by doctors to support her heartbeat slowly ceased to work and were eliminated from the body.
She died a little early, and that was the end of it all.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing that it was happening.
I couldn’t cry, scream or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it in myself.”
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning her dead daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers unaware of the hardship she was facing.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“My head was lowered and my tears were falling all the time.
It’s hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt a lot of pity for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards for mourning women to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh Bridge distribute postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to seek help.
Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want a single parent to feel like I have to feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up the room.”
But he quit his job before he died because he was in a “truly dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his suicide brother.
Mr Davis said: “I am constantly afraid of a chain reaction.”
Davis created the postcards “so that people know that there are people around who can be approached and talked to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk.”
Humphreys, a longtime friend of Davies, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark, who died shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed, and didn’t complain about anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
The situation was very bad at Christmas: when the children unwrapped their presents, he did not look them in the eye and did not react in any way."
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: "It left a void in the family.
It breaks our heart.
But we all have to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance after FBI investigation
I thought if we could actually get what he asked for -- an investigation of a limited duration and scope -- we might bring a little bit of unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" in the strong supporters' clutches.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their contradiction is determined solely by time.
There are only five weeks left before the midterm elections on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to fail, their efforts to elect the person they want to elect to the nation’s top court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators to try to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh could win 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cut ties and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
When Kim came to power, the number of North Korean defectors "decreased"
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea had fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park, citing data from the Unification Ministry of South Korea, said 1,127 deserters were identified last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tightening controls on the North Korean-Chinese border and rising prices for human smuggling.
Pyongyang did not make public comments.
Many North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many have fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them home.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on the denuclearisation of the country.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, when the two agreed in principle to work towards making the Korean peninsula a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of keeping its sanctions unchanged.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, we cannot trust our national security and under such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm," Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says he's unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview she gave Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I just cannot help thinking that if a woman did this, she would be said to be hysterical," Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, when he talked about family and high school, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes crying or crying.
He also utterly denounced the committee’s former democrats, calling the charges “grotesque and coordinated reputational annihilation” that had been organized by liberals outraged by Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he could not work in the Supreme Court because he revealed his biased view of Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and attack by the Clinton and Democratic parties," she said.
Asked whether he would seek to oust Kavanaugh if his candidacy was confirmed and the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
"I will say yes if he lies to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to serve not only in the Supreme Court but in the court where he is now serving," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia Court of Appeal.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about possible Kavanaugh rulings on the Affordable Health Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he was seen as a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time to say, with a hysterical, biased personality on the verge of judging, 'How wonderful!'" Pelosi said.
The Power Women Should Have
It’s a legitimate criticism, a rage that has finally spilled for months and even years, and that she cannot express without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued: “One woman, a manager of a company, helped me a lot when she told me that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed a method: when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to: ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm really angry."
And she just kept crying.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is from one of my first jobs in the office, where mostly men worked and where I once started to cry because of the unspeakable rage. Then I was grabbed by the leg by an older woman, a harsh manager, whom I always feared a little, and dragged to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad, so they’ll be happy to beat you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Party congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught by an adulterer on board the Monkey Business and withdrew his candidacy, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he could not run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing after 30 years.
There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for another.
Somebody called me "Snow White with the Seven Dwarfs."
Late in the campaign, she had little time to raise funds, so she swore she would not announce her candidacy until she raised <0x24>2 million.
It was an unequal struggle.
She noticed that some sponsors donated <0x24>1,000 each to men, but only gave her <0x24>250 each.
“Did they think I was getting a discount?” she asked.
In her speech announcing that she was launching a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — a system of gratitude to people, a system of frustration that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and reach voters directly instead of representatives, and anger at sexism — that she wept.
"You would have thought I was nervous," Schroeder recalled the press reaction to her speech.
– You would have thought I was supported by Kleenex napkin business.
I remember thinking what would be written in my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How U.S.-China trade can benefit Beijing
The first salvo in the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the rift could eventually benefit Beijing.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing duties on key Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most notable confrontation occurred this week when new tariffs came into effect on <0x24>200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of China’s U.S. exports.
Beijing responded by imposing a five to ten percent tariff on <0x24>60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to fight the U.S. for a tooth, and the world’s second-largest market does not seem to be going down in the near future.
Washington would ease sanctions only if China abides by demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts say that if Beijing plays its part properly, a trade war with the United States could eventually have a positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of the markets.
"That a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could cause the two economies to crash is actually far more dangerous than observers have so far acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a researcher at Asia's Center for New American Security.
Syrian Foreign Minister Says Syria Ready to Accept Returning Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Progress in the fight against terrorism has made the situation on the ground much more stable and secure," he said.
The authorities are continuing their efforts to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terrorists and to restore the situation to normal.
The conditions are already in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave as a result of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against daily life and well-being.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
The six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or aid from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team, which beat the US team with the final result of 16.5:10.5, won the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National near Paris (France).
The United States has lost for the sixth time in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup on the continent since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after a team of Captain Thomas Bjorn of Danish origin scored 14.5 points, enough to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who was struggling throughout the tournament, fired a 16-hole shot straight into the water in a 3-day match against Francesco Molinari.
Molinari became one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 since the tournament's current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was defeated by Denmark’s lowest-ranking European player Thorbjorn Olesen at 5:4.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top scorer, lost 2:1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a Spanish veteran of eight Ryder Cup tournaments, has become the most successful European player of all time, scoring 25.5 career points.
“I rarely cry, but I can’t control myself.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy, very happy to have the cup back.
It all depends on the team and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods in Sunday's 2-to-1 game of singles.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him play," said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now holds the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This is a bizarre statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 of the biggest prizes and landed only on Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the driveline over the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a high-profile game throughout the tournament.
U.S. Capt. Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we started to put pressure on the Europeans.
We were fighting.
I put my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to bow my head.
Our opponents were superior.”
"Red Flood" news: Painelas, Manati and Sarasota are in decline
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) said in a recent report that the total concentration of "red flooding" in the waters of the Gulf of Tampa is declining.
According to the FWC, more fragmentary blooms have been observed in the counties of Painelas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, suggesting that concentrations are declining.
The blooming of the "Red Flood" spans about 130 miles of coastline from northern Painelas to southern Li counties.
Flowering areas can be found about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsboro County, but fewer than last week.
"Red Flood" was also observed in Pasko county.
Last week, it was reported that concentrations in Painelas County and along its coastline were moderate, along Hillsboro County coastline from low to high, in Manati County from background to high, in Sarasota County and along the coastline from background to high, in Charlotte County from background to medium, and along Lee County coastline from background to high, and in Coleer County from background to high.
Cases of respiratory irritation are still reported in the counties of Painelas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida in the past week.
