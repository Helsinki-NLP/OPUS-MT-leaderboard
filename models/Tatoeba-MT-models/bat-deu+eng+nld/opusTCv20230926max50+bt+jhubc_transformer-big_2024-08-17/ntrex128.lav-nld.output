Assembly Members of the Assembly of Members (AM) of the Assembly Assembly of Members (AM) are concerned about the possibility of "be perceived as a whiw"
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their job title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Its cause is plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament"(Welsh Parliament).
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
One of the AM from the Labour party said that their group was concerned about "the reps with the words Twp and Pwp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "individual" and "pwp" means "kaka".
Party Plaid AM stated that none of the group "was not satisfied" and has suggested alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party admitted that their group was ready to consider a name change, but added that "MWP" very much resembles "Muppet", which means "herpes".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire dialect "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a draft bill to change the name, said: "The final decision as to which terms are to be used to designate members of the Assembly shall, of course, be made by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal, which generated broad support for changing the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
In terms of AM's name, the panel preferred the "Welsh Parliament Member" (WMP), but MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
AM strongly recommends alternative options, but the struggle for a deal may be a headache for Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to table a change bill in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including laws on the disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on what they will be called will take place after the legislative acts have been discussed.
Macedonians go to vote in a referendum to change the name of the country.
Vote Voters voters will vote on Sunday Sunday whether their country will be renamed "Republic of North Macedonia" or "Republic of North Macedonia".
A referendum was held to resolve decades-long disputes with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour gives the impression of claims to its territory, and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's request for admission to the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, one of the opponents of the plebiscite for changing the name, said he was ignoring the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply something that needs to be done in order to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent, as the churches of Haarlem fight for existence.
"As the old people I've talked to say, there used to be a bar and a church on every corner," says Mr Adams.
"Now there is neither one nor the other."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"Barbars are no longer neighbourhood living rooms that people visit regularly."
Spe speaking even to the churches, he fears that the money received from the sale of property will run out sooner than the leaders hope, "and sooner or sooner they shall have returned to their place of beginning."
The Church will probably be replaced by apartment buildings with apartment properties, where people will stay, who will not help the shrines remaining in the area.
"Most of the people who will buy the flats in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus the day will come when these churches will be closed forever, because it is unlikely that most of the people who will enter these flats will become members of these parishes."
Both churches were built by the white congregation, even before Haarlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left the building in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the black congregation, which had worshiped God right next door.
The black congregation of St. Martin's Church took over his blessings during John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of working retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Haarlem, who had refused to hire blacks or give them a promotion.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but as the members of Father Johnson's congregation were planning to renovate the building, they ordered a bell game.
His blessing David Johnson David Johnson, son of his father Johnson son and successor to St. Martin's Church, proudly called the bell game "for the bells of the poor."
The expert expert who played this bell game in July, who played this bell game in July, used other words: "a cultural treasure treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert from the University of Michigan, added that this was the first bell game in the world played by the black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather told that St. Martin's congregation did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s Church reflected the knotted relationship between architects and contractors, some of whom were attracted to work by secular power, and others by the episcopal diocese of the church.
The Council of the Congregation, made up of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would "try to pass on the costs" to the council, although the council was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the parish complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese’s activities.
shark 13-year-old teen 13-year-old shark hurts 13-year-old teenager at lobloblob
shark shark on Saturday in California attacked a 13-year-old boy who dive after lobsters and wounded him. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services say.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends were nipping for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then with the group rowed up to him to help pull the boy out of the water.
Hammel Hammel explained that at first he had thought it was just a delight for the lobloblobloblobloblobster caught, but then "he realized that the boy screamed, "I was bitten by a loblobloblobloblobloblob
suppospospospospospospospospospospospospospospospospospos
All his key bone had been torn open," Hammel said, who immediately noticed it when he had reached the boy.
"I'm screaming for everyone to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was taken by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was deemed critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told the media in a briefing that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was recognized that it was not a species dangerous to humans.
I don’t know if I’ll be able to do it again.
For the duration of the investigation and for safety reasons, access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas was closed for 48 hours.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty industry market
Sainsbury's goes on strike at Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty product rack rows and trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow despite declining fashion and home furnishing sales, 11 stores in the country will try out larger shelves for beauty products, and if all goes well, next year there will be more.
In the beauty industry, money is invested when supermarkets are looking for shelves that were previously reserved for TVs, microwave ovens and home goods.
Sainsbury's announced that it would double its beauty products for up to 3000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPawPaw.
Existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more space with brand areas similar to those in Boots stores, for example.
The supermarket also re-launches its "Boutique" line of make-up products, where most of the products will be vegan-friendly – something that is increasingly being demanded by younger buyers.
In addition to that, the perfume wholesaler Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
online shopping and the shift to small daily grocery purchases in local stores means that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that outlets will become more and more like department stores as a chain of stores struggles with the discount stores Aldi and Lidl, offering a wider range of services, but without food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in several hundred stores and has opened several Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which is said to have improved sales and made the purchased product more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in a defeat.
Sainsbury's joint venture with Boots was tried in the early 2000s, but the alliance broke up after a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from pharmacy merchandise stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy evolves after Sainsbury's 3 years ago sold its 281 stores large pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
According to this plan, the task of Lloyds will be to supplement the assortment with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including "Roche-Posay"and "Vichy", in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve the environment for customers, we have redesigned the look and feel of the rows on the shelves of our beauty products.
We have also invested funds in specially trained colleagues, who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, but the attractive environment combined with convenient location means we are now a delightful destination on the way to beauty, a destination that challenges our shopping habits."
Peter Jones is “full of anger” after Holly Willowbitch gives up a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
"Dragon Den" star Peter Jones was "overtaken by anger" after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus all his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willowby does not have time to devote to the brand "Truly" of their home outfits and accessories.
The pair’s business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow’s Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old broadcaster used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby has left "Dragon Den" star Peter Jones boiled in anger as he left their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute — to focus on his new colossal contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources of information claim that Jones was "full of anger" when a TV golden girl during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant she had no more time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand "Truly".
The company was compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Platrowa, and, according to hints, it will double the wealth of Viloubia, which is estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Willowby (37) used Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones took away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source of the story: "Truly was the most important of Holly's priorities.
It was supposed to become her long-term future, to which the next decades would be devoted.
Her decision to withdraw surprised all involved unprepared.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
Marlow in the centre of Marlow has a warehouse full of ready--to-sale goods."
Experts believe that leaving the manager of This Morning, one of the most financially profitable stars, can cost the company millions, because a lot of money has been invested in various products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home goods, and their launch will be further delayed.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willouby, the mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have 10 years had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willowby "Truly" was set up in 2016 together with Kep, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willowby is set to become the brand’s M&S messenger, and she will replace Ant McPartlin as the CEO of ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity.”
a source close to Jones Jones, a source close to Jones Jones, said yesterday: "We don't want to comment on his business business business!"
Serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from news companies for a comment that some may find "unacceptable to the president" and for his so positive treatment of the North Korean leader.
Why has the President refused so much? Why has the President refused so much?
I don’t know if I’m going to do it again.
"I didn't give up anything!"
He said Kim had expressed interest in meeting again after Trump recognized his initial meeting in Singapore in June as a big step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
The talks about denuclearization, however, have come to a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, one of North Korea’s top diplomats, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no U.S. “response” to North Korea’s initial steps toward disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
I don’t know if I’m going to do that, but I’m going to do it.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his work to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: stopping missile tests, helping to release prisoners, and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach when it came to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to make an impression on the president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this tightly populated area, we have 200 right here,” Trump said, referring to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy the island, killing hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok were displaced, the state of national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they said very clearly that they were not asking for international assistance, so this is a known problem," Ms. Sumbung admitted.
Although Save the Children collects a group to drive to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, explained that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the regular occurrence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unprepared for the rage of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been established in Aceh, they are rare along other coasts.
It is likely that the loss of human life was also influenced by the fact that the Palu did not sound the warning sirens for the tsunami, although the warning was valid.
Even in the most favorable times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate the logistics.
The ship-hospital, which had anchored in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is now heading for Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new devastation.
President Joko Widodo had made the improvement of Indonesia’s ruined infrastructure the focal point of his election campaign, and he has given large sums to roads and railways.
However, Mr. Djoko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funds and will be re-elected next year.
In addition, Mr. Djoko has to contend with a long-standing problem caused by tensions between sects in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge is ambitiously re-establishing the balance against Chelsea in the match against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute at Saturday's Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Starig received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, about 25 meters (30 yards) from the Chelsea goal, when his team lost 1:0.
He moved the ball a little to the left of himself and then kicked the ball in the direction of the farthest goalpost.
In this attempt, the ball flew high over the field, reaching the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over the head of the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga (Kepa Arrizabalaga) and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get the position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I just tried to get myself as much time as possible," Stauditch explained LiverpoolFC.com.

He then made a beautiful kick between the players, allowing Azard to get into the zone.
Azard beat the defense at speed and finished the combination, with his left foot punching in the net of the farthest pole, passing "Liverpool" Alison Becker.

The number of victims of the Tsunami in Indonesia reaches 832 people.
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832 people, the national disaster agency announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many people are trapped in the rubble of buildings after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet (<0x7E>6.0 m) high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the agency, told a news conference.
The town of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered in debris of collapsed buildings.

A police spokeswoman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a native of Birkenhead and was found on her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, according to police information, they are in the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim.
The driver of the taxi, who lives in Grayson City, tried to return to his apartment, but the police replied to him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He was unable to say a word when he found out what had happened.

scandal Cromwell's statue in parliament parliament becomes the latest scandal of "rewriting history" scandal
The rejection of this would be ethically justified in view of the Taliban-like activities that led to the destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious monuments by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Mr. Crick's proposal as "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the ongoing debate about removing the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside of Westminster Palace would also become a target.
Cromwell himself neither ordered nor executed the destruction of the icons during the English Civil War.
a misconception that the wrong Cromwell might be sacrificed to his forefather, Thomas, who lived centuries earlier.
The gorgeous depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft shows a viewpoint in the 19th century and is part of historiography of a person who many believe is still worthy of veneration.
Mr Goldsmith informed the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was seen by many - probably more at the end of the 19th century than today - as a defender of parliament against external pressure, which in his case was, of course, a monarchy.
There are continuing historical discussions about whether this is really a completely accurate depiction of the topic.
Clearly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the future development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable personality, representing one of the sides of the division of that time.
His accomplishments as the protector of the Lord are worthy of praise and commemoration."
The pig-killed pig-killed to death is torn by a farmer in China
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed in a pig market in southwest China.
A man — only his surname Yuan is mentioned — was found dead with a torn artery, all in one blood at the pig barn market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
The pig farmer is about to inject the vaccines to pigs in the pig barn in Xining Province of Qinghai in China on 30 May 2005.
It is reported that he and his cousin had arrived from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found the man dead and found that the door of the adjacent pig barn was standing open.
He recounted that there was a large male pig in the pig barn with blood on his mouth.
According to information, forensic medical investigation confirmed that a 550-pound (<0x7E>249 kg) heavy boar had torn the farmer.
"The legs of my cousin's cousin's legs were bloody and macccccured," said his cousin -- only his surname surname Wu (Wu) is mentioned, writes "Guiyang Evening News".
Security chamber material showed how Yuan enters the market on Thursday around 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the Yuan did not belong to either him or his cousin.
The market manager informed Evening News that the weeper was turned on to prevent his attacks on others while the police were gathering evidence on the scene.
According to information, Yuan Yuan's family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, it is known about other attacks of pigs on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a man being critically injured.
Another 10 years ago, a 650-pound (<0x7E>295-kg) heavy pig in Wales held the farmer down to the tractor until the animal was frightened by his wife.
After farmers in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “pistol shot.”
They are simply playful.
They like to pin them, they are very curious ... they don't want to hurt you.
"You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
Or Orcan Rose Rose Rose Clo Clo Clo Clo Closs of Orcan Rose Brings Wide and Strong Rain in the Southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, the hurricane Rosa will weaken as it moves across the coldest waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, within the next few days, Rosa will bring flooding torrential rains in the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At five o’clock in the afternoon (Eastern North American Time), the Rose wind gusts reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour), corresponding to a Category 1 Hurricane, and its point was 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
meanwhile, a low-pressure depression is formed over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastwards towards the east coast of the United States. Rose, with the strength of a tropical storm approaching the Baja California peninsula, on Monday it will begin to push the moisture masses deep from the tropical belt northwards towards the southwest of the United States.
Rose on Monday in part of Mexico will bring up to 10 inches (<0x7E>25.4 cm) of rain.
Then the tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching low-pressure depression, will create a large area of heavy rainfall in the south-west over the next few days.
1–4 inch (<0x7E>2.6–10.2 cm) rainfall will cause dangerous sudden floods, mud currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
Humidity deep out of the tropical belt will cause torrential rains that will reach 2-3 inches (<0x7E>5.1-7.6 cm) per hour in some places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the south-west, especially in most parts of Arizona, it is expected to rain up to 24 inches (<0x7E>5,2-10,1 cm) of rain.
Sudden flooding with a sharp deterioration of the condition due to the dispersion of tropical rainstorms is possible.
It is very undesirable to walk in the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainstorms.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but thunderstorms will bring local gusty winds and sandstorms.
A low-pressure depression will bring strong local rainfall to a part of the coastline of Southern California.
There are possible rainstorms, which together will exceed half an inch (<0x7E>1.3 cm), and this can lead to small mud flows and slippery roads.
It will be the region's first rainfall in the wet season.
Arizona will begin approaching late on Sunday and early on Monday before the rain will take over a wider area late on Monday and early on Tuesday.
Heavy rain on Tuesday will spread in the Four Corners region (DR Colorado, DA Utah, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and last all Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the US, as temperatures in the Arctic drop, but the tropics are still relatively warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in temperature over a short distance.
This is an example of a dramatic temperature difference on Sunday in the central United States.
The difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Des Moines, Iowa, differs by almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the long-lasting summer heat will try to form and expand.
The beginning of October is expected to be warm in much of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit (<0x7E>27 degrees Celsius) or more in large areas from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
Temperatures in the city of New York could reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (<0x7E>27 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability that in the first half of October the temperatures in the eastern United States will exceed the average.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in the case of Brett Brett Caveno
More than 20 million people watched with passion on six television channels on Thursday, as evidenced by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Caveno of sexual harassment, which the woman claims happened in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political turmoil continued, with broadcasters interrupting their regular broadcasts to report on the latest developments on Friday: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Caveno had been overwhelmed by her drunkenness and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Caveno unpassionately testified that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, 20.4 million people watched all this on Friday, according to a report from Nielsen.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC registered average viewers' interest.
Data from other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, who demonstrated it, were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually has problems counting the number of people who are watching what's happening in the offices.
To get a better picture, this viewer count corresponds to the number of viewers in the playoffs or the Oscars.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in order to lay down detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation.
I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do it again.
In the event of a dispute between a Member State and a Union institution or a Union institution, the Commission shall be assisted by the European Data Protection Supervisor, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican team had published a statement that he would vote for the appointment of Caveno, the senator noticed the cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when he, escorted by the protesters' outrage cries, tried to get by elevator to the hearings of the Justice Committee.
On CNN live, he stood for several minutes with pierced eyes, like a barbed wire.
"I stand here right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi
Flake explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed he was informed that he had something to say during the committee hearing.
cable networks and broadcasters reflected what was happening live several hours later, when the Committee on Justice was about to vote for the nomination of Caveno to vote in the Senate.
Flake said he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would look into the charges against the candidate next week, which had been demanded by the Democratic minority.
Fllak was partly convinced by conversations with his Democratic senator Chris Coons (Chris Coons) and his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After talking with Koons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was significant because it was clear that Republicans would not have votes to approve Caveno without an investigation.
President Trump has instructed the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of political games Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused people criticising her plan to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, right next to an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, May’s former foreign minister Boris Johnson continues to attack her Brexit plan for Britain’s future relationship with the European Union, the so-called (Chequers plan), stressing that the suggestion that Britain and the EU use each other’s tariffs is “absolutely absurd”.
A type of Sims shooting: Police have arrested Dieton Simpson, who is suspected of murdering a LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.

ash ash spies ash over Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico
The ash that rises from the Pocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhood of the Mexican capital.
After activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano.
The Center observed repeated rebellion and trembling.
Images in social networks showed that the windshields of cars in the vicinity of Mexico City, for example, in Hochimilco (Xochimilco), are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have noticed the activation of the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
police conflict with Catalan separatist separatist separatist police conflict with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with the public order police and when thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote for secession.
A group of disguised supporters of separation, who were hindered by the public order police, trampled them with eggs and shed powdery paint, forming dark clouds of dust on the streets, which would normally be full of tourists.
Conflicts broke out later that day as well, and the police used batons to prevent fights.
For several hours, groups of supporters of independence for several hours, chanting: "Do not forget and not forgive!", were engaged in confront with pro-unity protesters who chanted: "For a long life to Spain!"
According to local newspapers, fourteen people received medical care during protests because of minor injuries.
One year after the referendum of 1 October in Madrid, which was declared illegal, but was praised by the Catalans, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains under great strain.
Voters confidently spoke out for independence, although voter turnout was low, and those who were against secession boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to Catalan officials, almost 1000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, and violent clashes broke out.
The pro-independence groups were on duty on Friday night to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw how the eyes of my parents were filled with tears of joy for being allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped,” he said.
Although parties supporting Catalan independence won last year’s regional elections with a small but significant majority, these parties have fought to maintain their momentum this year, as several of the best-known leaders have either emigrated or have been imprisoned and are awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who filmed a protest on his phone to support the police, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting more and more," he said.
On Saturday, one of Catalonia's nine leaders, Uriol Junqueras, who has been in prison pending trial since last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"candidididi to the European elections is the best way to expose the regress of democratic values and the repression we have been subjected by the Spanish government," he said.

beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat beat "rangers" by livingston "Livingston" with 1-0 win
Dollyly Menga's first goal win for Livingston win for Livingston
Supported Livingston stunned the Rangers, bringing Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as a manager of Ibrox.
The blow of Dolly Meng turned out to be decisive, as the team of Gary Holt smoothed out the situation with the "Hibernian".
In the event of a dispute between a Member State and a third country or international organisation concerning the interpretation or application of the provisions of this Directive, the Member State concerned shall take the necessary measures to comply with the provisions of this Directive.
In the European League on Thursday, the Rangers hosted the Vienna Rapid on Thursday.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in order to lay down detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation.
"Livingston" does not take the opportunity against duddd guests
Holt's team, with their face-to-face game, which made the Rangers difficult in all sorts of ways, should have been in the lead long before they got the words.
Scott Robinson broke out, but delayed his goal rehearsal, then Alan Lithgow's attempt after slipping in to prevent Craig Halkett from hitting his head over the goal line was unsuccessful.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop guests in planned places.
And that's how the decisive gate came.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to give a chance to Meng, who struck and scored a goal from the middle of the zone.
At this stage, the Rangers controlled the ball, but the protection of the guests turned out to be impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly disturbed by anyone.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos ordered Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pittman's attempt was interrupted by the agility of the Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov missed the goal in the Livingston combination.
centred balls continued to appear in the Livingston area, but two calls for punishment were rejected after Halkett fought for the ball with replacement Glenn Middleton and for hand-playing.
"Phenomenal" "Livingston" performance — analysis
Scottish BBC BBC BBC Alasdair Lamont Alasdair Lamont Alasdair Lamont "Tony Maccaroni" arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was excellent, continuing to surpass expectations, constantly improving performance.
Their style of play and personalities have hardly changed since returning to the top echelon, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has teamed up since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in maintaining first-class organized defense, while Menga ensured that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were always vigilant.
But the "Rangers" lacked inspiration.
No matter how well they were at times under Gerard's command, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring -- just one time they broke into a part of the landlord's square -- and it's basically a call to awaken the "Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Erdogan Erdogan in Köln erwartet in Köln mit geteilten Gefühlen
Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of smiles and blue sky.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on a range of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
The police blocked a crowd of 25 000 people for security reasons, preventing them from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also expressed their attitude, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him.
The mutual protests of both sides reflect the inconsistencies caused by the guest, some of whom consider the German Turk to be a hero, while others despise him as an autocrat.
road traffic accident in Deptford Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
In a collision with a car in London, a cyclist was killed.
The collision occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street (Bestwood Street) and Evelyn Street (Evelyn Street), on a high traffic section in Deptford, south-east of the city at around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the help was provided by a medical doctor, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred several months after another cyclist died in Childers Street (Childers Street), about a mile from the Sunday collision site. The driver then left the crash site.
The Police Service of the capital city announced that the police are engaged in identifying the man and informing their relatives.
On the site of the event, roads are closed and buses are diverted, but car drivers are advised to avoid this zone.
Long Lartin Prison Long Lartin Prison Long Lartin Prison: Six workers wounded in riots
The Prison Office reports that six prison staff members were injured in a riot in a men's hard-line prison.
Chaos broke out at the "HMP Long Lartin" prison in Worcestershire at about 9.30 a.m. at BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
The Special Service Tornado personnel were involved to prevent riots involving eight detainees and bounded on one wing
Employees were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A representative of the Prison Service stated: "Specially trained prison staff was involved to solve the incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance due to injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly spend more time behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
As of June, it was reported that the prison chief was hospitalized after the prisoner was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, staff in charge of mud control were sent to prison to solve serious troubles, in which staff were attacked with billiard bombs.
Orcan Orcan Rose Rose Phoenix Phoenix, Las Vegas, Las Vegas and Salt Lake Salt Lake City are in danger of sudden flooding (probably drought areas)
Arizona rarely suffers from tropical depression, but that is what is likely to happen early next week, when Hurricane Rosa with its remaining force will move across the deserted southwest, posing a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flash flood warning on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to cross the Phoenix directly on Tuesday, arriving with rain late on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter tweeted that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or depressions within a 200-mile (320 km) radius of Phoenix!
Catherine Catherine (196767) was a hur Hor Hor Hor Hor Hor Hor Hor  40 miles (65 km) from the AZ borders."
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict a rainfall of 2-4 inches (<0x7E>5,08–10,2 cm), reaching up to 6 inches (15,24 cm) in some places.
Other areas in the desert southwest, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1-2 inches (<0x7E>2.54-5.08 cm), reaching up to 4 inches (<0x7E>10.2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the Rose Rain can be a blessing because the region is afflicted by drought.
Although the possibility of flooding is a very serious concern, some rainstorms are likely to be beneficial, as the south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rose’s road leads to Baja California peninsula in Mexico, where it will reach the shore.
Rose is still with Hurricane Force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, is located about 385 miles (<0x7E>620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm storm meets cooler waters of the Pacific Pacific Ocean and therefore calms down.
It is therefore expected that the hurricane with the force of a tropical storm will reach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
The rainy part of Mexico City can be strong, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the rainfall will reach 3-6 inches (7,62-15,24 cm) from Baja California in the south-western part of Sonora, with precipitation likely to reach 10 inches (25,4 cm)," reported weather.com.
Rose will move north, across Mexico as a tropical storm and then reach the Arizona border on Tuesday early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then move across Arizona and end up in southern Utah on Tuesday late at night.
"The main dangers to be expected from Rose or its remains are very heavy rainfall in Lower California, in the north-western part of Sonora and in the desert south-west of the United States," the National Center for Organs said.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.

Trump Trump says Caveno Caveno has suffered “evil and anger” of the Democratic party "evil and anger"
"The vote for Judge Caveno is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and violent tactics," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
In the event of a dispute between a Member State and the Commission, the Commission shall inform the other Member States and the other Member States of the outcome of the dispute.
Caveno testified before Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally denied any accusation of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford several decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford, too, testified during the hearing of her accusations.
The President said on Saturday Saturday that that day "American Americans saw the excellence, ability and courage of Caveno's Caveno's "excell, ability and courage."
"The vote to approve Judge Caveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a brilliant history of service to the nation," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
President Caveno mentioned the nomination of President Caveno when he talked about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I did not stand as a candidate, but in fact I stand as a candidate," he said.

Hundreds of people killed in an earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
Officers reported on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed away when gigantic waves struck the coasts after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palu, when up to six meters (18 feet) of high waves slammed against the shore in twilight, swept away many to death and ruined everything in their path.
The Tsunami erupted after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When yesterday's tsunami threat erupted, people were still working on the beach and didn't flee immediately, and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it ripped everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
"Many people climbed trees to save themselves and survived," he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs taken during the flight of the Disaster Agency show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
After the earthquakes the coastal city continued to shake on Saturday.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
BPPT, the Indonesian agency for technology assessment and application, said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay probably reinforced the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide-scale" and reported the collapse of thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels.
He said the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho admitted that the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications "were completely destroyed, no information was received from Donggal," Nugroho reported.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the disaster-stricken regions.
"It's already a tragedy, but everything could have been even worse," the organization said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had hit Pala, although officials claimed that the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In a video distributed in social networks, it is heard that a man on the top floor of a building desperately calls people on the street at the bottom that he is approaching a tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
The news agency "Reuters" was not able to immediately confirm whether the material is real.
An earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power supply, which cut off communications in Palu, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials announced that the army has begun to send cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still have a great need for food and other basic necessities.
The City Airport is open only for assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo’s evacuation centers in Palu were scheduled to visit on Sunday.
More than 800 victims of the Tsunami disaster relief relief relief relief in Indonesiandondondondondondondondondondondondondon over 800.
This is very bad.
Mr. Doseba said that the employees of World Vision, who successfully reached Palu from Donggal (Donggala) and now live in tarpaulin sheds in the backyard of the office, passed the scenes of destruction along the way.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that had been destroyed," he explained.
This is very bad.
Even when relief groups have resolutely begun to organise relief for the victims of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience were not allowed to go to Pala.
According to Indonesian law and regulations, funding, resources and personnel of overseas organizations will only be allowed to arrive if the disaster area is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "OK OK, it's a national disaster," we can accept international aid, but that status has not yet been determined."
When the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami came to Palu, the friends and family of the still unexplored people continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that would brighten the gloomy life of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been pressed under the rubble for two days, next to the corpse of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, had prepared two of the missing paraglider Asian Games, which took place this month earlier in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were their students.
"As an experienced para paraleader," he said, "I bear the burden of emotion.".
Mr. Gendon remembered that after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the paragliders in the team, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages for hours to the participants of the Palu race, who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark instead of two blue marks.
"Think, it means that the reports did not reach the addressee," he said.

Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye (Je).
Announcing his replacement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The Messenger who previously knew him as Kanji West."
41-year-old West has long been called Je and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June ("Ye").
This change occurs before his appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live", in which, as expected, he will release his new album "Yandhi".
The creators of the show say that he replaces singer Arian Grandi, who stopped working for "emotional reasons".
West has said that this is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also has a religious meaning.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "You,"" West explained earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, it is we.
In the beginning there was Kanje, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is a reflection on the good and the bad in us, on our confusion, on everything.
The album album more is more reflection reflection about who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.

Mexican President Elect Mexican President pledges not to use army against civilian civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, President-elect of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians at a time when the 50th anniversary of the bloody retribution of students is approaching.
Lopez Lopez Obrador Obrador vowed "Never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
A peaceful demonstration was shot dead on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were spreading across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans with monthly student subsidies and the opening of more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education draws young people into criminal gangs.
US US should double the funding funding for artificial intelligence artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
comments were made after various U.S. government bodies made announcements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. as a whole lacks a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: its goal is to become a key country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A two-fold budget for AI research will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind in the US and the next major breakthrough in AI is expected,” Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding could double the chances of the next AI breakthrough happening in the US.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that would outperform America’s best Othello player (Reversi), but later he was a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions organized by the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next would be ready to identify people with ideas for the future.
"Scientists in the U.S. often have to work very hard to get government grants," Lee said.
"It's not China that attracts the top scientists, but the big companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years hired university luminaries to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. to improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should automatically be awarded to people with a PhD in Philosophy in Artificial Intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its next-generation AI development plan.
Lee explained that the National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions, similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense (DDA) set up a single common AI center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on AI.
And this month, DARPA (the US Defense Ministry's Central Organization for Research and Development) announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next."
The National Science Foundation, on the other hand, currently invests more than 100 million dollars a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the United States, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) has not been in place for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" as part of a move to end decades of dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, emphasizes that the name of its northern neighbour indicates claims on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists insist that the changes will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a campaign calling for a boycott has raised concerns about whether the turnout will reach at least the 50% required to validate the referendum.
The referendum ball puts a question in the referendum poll: "Are you on NATO and EU membership by agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price to pay on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that arose after the breakup of Yugoslavia, to become an organisation such as a member of the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonia's youth, so that they can live freely, under the cover of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs have announced that they will take account of the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
In order to change the name, a 2/3 majority in the parliament will be required.
I don’t know if I’m going to do it, but I’m going to do it.
However, the activity was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Prime Minister Zoran Zoran Za Zayev, his wife Zorrica Zorica and their son Dushko Dushko handed their votes in the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, to Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage and arranged the chairs next to the tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to stand with a head up, not through the servants' door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a small country, but we have self-esteem.
If they do not want us to be accepted as Macedonia Macedonia, we can turn to others, China or Russia, for example, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will initiate the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that a majority will cast a vote in favour, as more than 80"percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result "y yes yes yes" "will confirm our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research shows that 30 to 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - less than the required activity.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote in favour.
In order for a referendum to be a success, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government that came to power last May.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) sweeps through all the Brighton defenses to score a goal.
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton on Saturday at Manchester City Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, defeating 2:0.
Agvero gave the impression that his goal score in the 65th minute was ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian striker got a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the combination.
He ran between the three Brighton guards and rushed into the free field.
Then Agvero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He bypassed the ball for one defender, then beat several more Brighton on the edge of the field in the race.
Then he made a pass to the left, reaching Sterling.
An English center striker used his first touch to replay Agvero, who used the right football boot to beat Brigton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by hitting the ball on the right side of the net.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," City manager Pep Gardiola (Pep Guardiola) told reporters.
"We discussed the gameplay with him for 55, 60 minutes.
This is exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that time.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League wrestling.
I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do it again.
Agvero at the ball in the hand received deep in the territory of Brighton.
He sent the ball with a beautiful blow along the caviar of the left leg of Leroy Sane.
Sanné took several shots until Sterling was instructed to deliver the ball to the farthest goalpost.
The center attacker of the Sky Blues easily drove the ball into the net just before crossing the border.

Shercer Shercer wants to cause problems "Rockies"
Since the Nationals are not participating in the playoffs, there was no reason to reopen.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take the opportunity on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies are in the playoffs. And the Rockies in the Western Group of the National League are in the lead with one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.

It was no wonder that "Momentum" activists in my local party wanted to subject me to censorship.
After all, I’m the last Labour MP in the line so far, who was informed that he was unwelcome — that’s all, because we don’t hide our opinion.
Joan Ryan and my parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan felt the same way, because she was determined against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
For the importance of an economically responsible policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically, but these were issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a statement about a Labour meeting in East Nottingham East Nottingham on Friday Friday said "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my eight local Labour MPs were exactly that.
In the event of a breach of this Regulation, the controller or processor shall inform the data subject without undue delay of the breach and of the reasons for the breach.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any viewpoint is judged on its acceptability to the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy took the lead: colleagues, whom I think our political views are similar, began to expect that I would turn 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would never have accepted in other cases, whether it was national security or a single EU market.
When I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I'm saying -- there's a tirade about using social media, calling for a ban on standing as a candidate in the next election, exposing the centre's policy, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments made against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day, but never try to quietly avoid them.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization prepared for the diversity of views and with every expression of mistrust or change in the rules of selection, the party shrinks.
In the last two years I have often been given advice, asking me not to jump on the harrow, to think what I am talking about, and then "it will be all right" with me.
But that's not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a pupil in response to the Thatcher government's negligence, which had literally led to the collapse of my integrated school class, I have set myself the task of fighting for better public services for those who need them most, both as a member of the local council and as a government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, nor did I in the previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East had any reason to doubt my position on political issues and in areas where I disagreed with the current government.
For those who pushed the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a time when the country is moving resolutely towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But basically the only thing I want to say is not Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not they are Labour members: I am proud to serve you and I promise that any threat of denial or reminder that nobody is irreplaceable in politics will not stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": The unsold "Ayr" reaches the highest line in the table
The final result may have been somewhat skewed by the last two attempts, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting match of the Scottish Championship today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unbroken team out of ten.
After all, it was both their excellent defense and the much better use of opportunities that guided the hosts, and coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in all our games and we are still not defeated, so I have to rejoice," he said.
Robin Christie (Robyn Christie, Robyn Christie): "With all respect to Ayr Ayr, they took their chances better than we."
The 14-minute attempt by Frazier Climo, by Grant Anderson, raised the "Ayr" but a yellow card to Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, where he gave the "Warriors" to the game, changed the "Melrealized" numbers, and Jason Baggot (Jaot Baggot)
Climate increased Ayr's leadership by penalty, just at the end of the half-time, he scored points, then made a solo attempt, so that Ayr took 17-5 breaks.
However, Melrose started the half-time with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Begott reduced the lag to 5 points.
Then there was a long break, as Ruaridh Knott was severely injured and was taken off the field on a stretcher, but when the game resumed, the Ayr made rapid progress when Stafford McDowall made the rehearsal, which was carried out by Klima.
Captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again, under intense pressure, Melrose used an excess of players — with Bruce Colvine’s attempt, which was not realized.
The hosts got excited, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for catching Klima without a ball, from the penal corridor, McPherson did the butt on the back of the Ayr Pier.
Klimo realized the ball, as before, almost from the very reboot itself, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong on the pitch and sent a flank player Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the hosts.
The supernatural "Still Game" star seems to be planning a new career in the restaurant business.
Ford Kieran, the star of the comedy series "Still Game", seems to be planning to engage in the hospitality business, as it turns out that he has been named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he creates and plays with his longtime partner Greg Hemphill in comedy comedies.
The duet has announced that the next season of the ninth season will be the last in the show, and Craiglang is apparently planning his life after Craiglang.

"The sea belongs to us!": land-caught Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean.
Sailors patrol the fleet headquarters in La Paz, which is dressed in tows.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
The flagships of the fleet from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it is our duty."
In Bolivia, trapped on land, memories of Chile’s lost coastline in the bloody 19th century conflict over resources are still alive, as are the longings of sailing again in the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are probably the highest since decades, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit and, of course, with positive thoughts awaits the outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians Many Bolivians will watch the judgment of the International Court of Justice on big screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's demand that, after decades of interrupted negotiations, Chile has the duty to discuss the granting of a sovereign land access to Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic president of local origin, Evo Morales, who is waiting for a controversial fight for re-election next year, is also very interested in Monday's verdict.
"We are close to getting the Pacific Ocean back," he said.
However, some analysts believe that a court judgment in favor of Bolivia is unlikely, and if it is passed, no major changes are expected.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no mandate to allocate Chilean territory and its representatives have said that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is delivered just six months after the final hearing shows that the case "was not complicated", explained international normative expert Paz Zarate from Chile.
And the last four years of the Bolivian affair have not pushed things forward, but, on the contrary, have delayed them.
"The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales’s belligerent rhetoric has Chileans have stifled the remaining goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will one day continue the negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to hold a discussion.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Bolivia's representative in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, disagreed with the Court's unusually quick decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity "to put an end to 139 years of conflict that will benefit both sides", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Moraless—still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents—had used sea issues as political cops.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will give up nuclear weapons only when it can trust the USA
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to eliminate their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the meeting of the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems ready to resume the deadlocked diplomatic efforts to prevent a nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore met North Korean leader Kim Chen.
Ri says it is a "fantasy" to hope that the U.S. continued sanctions and unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean War will ever make North Korea kneel.
Washington is wary of agreeing to a declaration before Pyongyang takes substantial disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are skeptical about whether Pyongyang really wants to give up its armament, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim’s next meeting with Trump.

If you want to increase your hat hat collection or completely block the sun or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented the audience with a row of absurd, huge head-wear items in the collection of the spring/summer 2019 season, dazzling against the backdrop of the style set by Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their astonishing achievements to the fashion show.
Valentino’s most outstanding design was a gorgeous beige hat decorated with a feathers-like wide edge that devoured his heads.
Among the massive accessories were watermelons covered with precious stones, a magic hat and even pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your heads warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks — just before Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had their lips sewn on, and they served Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One of the formations was reminiscent of diving the minds of breathing, with a tube and glasses, while the other resembled a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue with massive fashion, then the time has come.
Style observers believe that huge owls are probably on their way to the High Streets closest to you.
Oversized hats immediately became popular after "La Bomba" appeared — straw hats with two feet (<0x7E>60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn all, from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The status of a very impractical hat as a cult object in all social networks led to another big creation on the tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as big as the model in a swimsuit carrying it.
reddish-yellow Raffia bag dressed with raffia fringe and equipped with a white leather handle occupies a special place in the spring/summer 2019 collection of "Jacquemus' La Riviera" in the spring/summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage explained FEMAIL to FEMAIL: "I expect that big hats and beach bags and beach bags will appear in the street shops of central business in the street stores next summer, because the designer has so impressed the designer that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge-sized accessories."
horhorhorquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiquiqui John John John John John Edward John John John Edward Edward Edward Edwards: the knowledge of languages is of vital importance to the citizens of the world
Scottish Independent Schools have a reputation for excellence in educational institutions and have maintained this reputation in 2018, when once again outstanding exam results were achieved, further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, the arts, music and other social events.
These schools, with a total of 30,000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best possible level of education for their students and their parents.
In the event of an emergency, the competent authority of the home Member State shall immediately inform the competent authority of the home Member State of the emergency and of the reasons for the emergency.
As an educational sector that can design and implement specific school curricula, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it remains in his consciousness.
If you speak his native language, it remains in his heart."
This is a compelling reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relationships and gain the trust of people from other countries.
Taking into account the recent exam results of this year, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest number of exams passed in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of all students who taught foreign languages reached the highest grade A.
Scottish Council of Independent Schools data for 74 schools shows that 72 percent of the pupils scored the highest grade A in Chinese and 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now as highly valued as subjects of choice in the programmes of independent schools as subjects in the group science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 survey by the British Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers cited a lack of language skills as a reason for failing to fill vacancies.
Language skills are therefore increasingly becoming compulsory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are vitally important in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career path, learning a foreign language will in future bring them a real benefit from such a long-term skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a multi-language speaker.
According to a YouGov 2013 survey of more than 4000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language good enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit equivalent number of people, 15 percent.
It is precisely for this reason that the investment in language teaching is important for today's children.
Multiple languages, especially the knowledge of the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland are different in terms of the languages they teach.
Some schools will pay more attention to the more common modern languages, while others will teach languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for Britain’s future, according to plans up to 2020.
Irrespective of what your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be specialists in the relevant field.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future.
In the current global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this fact should be reflected in education.
It is true, modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent Schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.

Trump Trump Trump West Virginia-West Virginia West West Virginia, YouTube channel YouTube YouTube
President Donald Trump today kicks off a series of rallies in Willingham, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned gatherings next week, including stopovers in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump aims to gain support in the upcoming interim elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control in Congress after the vote is passed in November.
When will Trump Trump meet in West Virginia, West Virginia, and how will you watch it live today?
The Trump Summit in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m., after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally live online on YouTube.
Trump is expected to speak about this week’s hearing in the case of Supreme Court candidate Bret Caveno, which has been strained by allegations of sex crimes, and a Senate vote is expected to delay approval for a week while the FBI conducts an investigation.
However, the main purpose of this rally is to help improve the situation of the Republicans, who are expected to vote in November.
President Trump’s campaign thus shows that the task of these next week’s five gatherings is to “activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans strive to protect and increase the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congress control over his agenda is so important that the president will visit the state as much as possible as we start a busy campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to reveal his name, told Reuters.
“This evening’s r r r rally, planned to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Willinging Willinging will likely attract supporters from Ohio Ohio and Pennsylvania Pennsylvania and will be featured in the Pittsburgh media,” West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia senator candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind, according to polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to help improve his results in polls," Simon Haeder, professor of political science at West Virginia University, told Reuters.

Athletes love to talk about fluctuations in luck, and they really believe in it, especially in competitions such as these.
So on which side do they think now is luck luck on which side?
"They were in the lead with six points, but now with four, so I think in a way it means that success has turned to us," said Jordan Spieth on his way.
"I don't know if it's going to happen, but it's going to happen."
Spit explained that Americans believe that the wind blows on their sails and they have reason for optimism, of course also in the person of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast three points out of four.
Spit has been destructive from the first blow to the lawn and is an example of a winner.
Those gutular victories became louder and louder as his round continued, a decisive kick was made in the hole to achieve four times the same number of kicks, when he and Thomas were two kicks behind two after two.

This is all that is left for these players.

The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly make their way into the history of this Raider Cup.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
Mollywood was the only couple who survived without a boggy on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided boggies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This course and the way their energy flows into this raging crowd and back convinces them they are the players to win on Sunday and Fleetwood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can secure a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
It is desirable for both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk of European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson (Bubba Watson) and Webb Simpson (Webb Simpson) quickly coped with this morning's hero "fourballs" in the format of Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren (Alex Noren).
Boggy and the two doubles in the front nine led the Spaniards and the Swedes into trouble, and they weren’t even close to getting out of it.
I am not sure if this is the case, but it is a good thing.
In the fourball and foursome formats of the game it is so exciting to watch nearby due to the interaction of couples, to watch what advice they give and what they don't, and how a strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has so far played better as a team and is far in the lead before the last day, but this competition in the format of "foursome" showed that the US team is determined to fight, which many, especially Stateside, have doubted.

After defeating Wood and Patrick Reed in the "fourballs" format, they then easily defeated the tired Wood and American Bryson Dechamhambeau with a more sensitive 5&4 5&4 result.

After being in second place for two days, as it seems, Sunday counterattack will be problematic.
North Korea has announced that it will not unilaterally, without trust, disarm "in any case".
North Korea’s foreign minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions had deepened its mistrust of the United States, and North Korea would never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho informed the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "significant steps of good will" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear weapons test site, and promising never to proliferation nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't see an adequate U.S. response," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will never be the first to unilaterally disarm first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known reproach for Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, under which Korea will be rewarded for step-by-step steps taken, his statement left an impression because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
The European Commission has today adopted a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 laying down the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93.
North Korea has attempted to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In the event of a dispute between the parties, the dispute shall be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
"The United States insists that 'denuclearization must come first' and increases the level of pressure imposed by sanctions to achieve the goal by force, even opposing the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions could push us to our knees is empty fantasies cherished by people who know nothing about us.
“But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our mistrus.”
If you’re looking for a job in a foreign country, you’re looking for a job in a foreign country, or you’re looking for a job in a foreign country, or you’re looking for a job in a foreign country, or you’re looking for a job in a foreign country.

However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from what he said last year when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the launching of North Korean missiles on the US mainland was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump had called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday that he had not set a specific time, stressing that "it does not matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months, or two years, or three years or five months."
China and Russia emphasize that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for what it has done.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be vigorously pursued without making mistakes until a final and convincing denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously tightened its sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to bring Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes to a halt.
Pompeo met Ri outside UN General Assembly meetings and was then informed that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trips were not successful.
He left Pyonyonyon in July, saying that progress had been made, but within hours, North Korea accused him of " Gangster worthy demands" by North Korea.
North Korea, meeting with Muna this month, undertook to dismantle a weapons depot and the nuclear complex, if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea wants to see are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students will learn the subject of how to have enough rest.
A new subject at Harvard University has made students sleep more this year, and this is an attempt to counter the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which involves studying caffeine-filled studies all night long.
A teacher discovered that students of the best university in the world often did not even have the basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital (Brigham and Women's Hospital) developed a subject that he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
Inspiration to create a new subject arose for him after speaking about the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
"In the end, a girl came up to me and asked, 'Why am I only being told this now that I am in the last year of my course?'
She revealed that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleep—what surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
Launched this year for the first time, the subject provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sport achievement and overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, informed that the university decided to introduce a training course after learning that students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week of study.
The hour-long training process consists of a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts there is an image of a dormitory door, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sport is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of bedtime routines.
In another part, students are informed about how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then the map of the campus with interactive icons invites the participants to rethink their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
Just as you have the right to know how your health will be affected by cigarette smoking," added Professor Chaisler.
He said that a culture that boasts of being able to learn all night long still exists, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that enough quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of the students, to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, because the lack of sleep the brain switches to fasting mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler develop a subject after attending one of his lectures last year, Harvard's first year.
He said that the subject had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course accessible to the whole campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask postgraduate students to study a similar program before going to enjoy the competition.
Professor Chaisler advises students to install an alarm not only for the time when they get up, but also when they go to sleep, and also to keep in mind how people are harmed by the "blue lights" emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lamps, as they can disrupt the circadian rhythms, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Menga Gate overturns Gerard's men
The Rangers were hit by another sad game in the room when Dolly Menga kicked Steven Gerrard (Steven Gerrard's confused team) for a 1-0 loss against Livingston.
Gary Holt secured Gerard Gerard Holt's second loss in 18 games since he became manager of the club, and his team is 8 points away from the Scottish championship leader Heart Hearts.
Menga kicked the ball into the goal seven minutes before half-time, and the lack of inspiration from the Rangers did not appear at all after an attempt to level the score.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in order to lay down detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation.
And the Rangers may have another problem, because the assistant judge, Calum Spence, needed medical attention because of a head injury apparently caused by an object thrown from the far end.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to lay down rules for the functioning of the internal market and to lay down rules for the application of this Regulation.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livingston 11 players who took away one point from the Hearts last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-trained team crushed opponents in each episode.
It is possible that Rangers were more likely to control the ball, but Livingston made better use of what was theirs.
They should have scored already two minutes after the start, when Menga's first hand sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate, but the center player missed his big chance.
Captain Craig Halkett then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to send the bomb far past the rear post.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to lay down rules for the application of this Regulation.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly believed that he should have taken a penalty kick in the 15th minute, after he had collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half of the year, but Liam Kelly, the former goalkeeper of the Ibrox, was not particularly disturbed, neither by Lassana Coulibaly's head-shot, nor by the modest Ovie Ejaria's end of the attack.
Although the 34th minute of Livingston might have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it already for their efforts.
"Rangers" once again did not cope with Jacobs' planned long-combination.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fired a bomb at Scott Robinson, who kept his balance and chose Meng for a simple ending.
Gerard replaced Coulibali in a break with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately affected the game, as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line immediately rushed to block.
But the Livingston continued to make the guests play as they please, with Litgov and Hulket taking one long shot after another.
Holt's team could have continued to lead in the final stage, but McGregor played well to stop Jacobs before Litgov took a head-on corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for Glenn Middleton, demanded another penalty kick late in the game after colliding with Jacobs, but Thompson ignored the request again.
Alma Alma Almanach: in Geiger inventor of the Geiger meter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born, who grew up as a physicist.
Geiger developed a method for measuring and measuring radioactivity, which ultimately resulted in a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has taken its place in science and has survived its place in the geiger counter has also taken its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado (Bells of Coronado) in which the main roles were played by outwardly inconiningly cowboy scientists Roger Rogers and Dale Evans, the Cowboy scientists Roger Rogers and Dale Evans:
the man: "What, at iodine, is this?"
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
"When you put these headphones on, you'll hear how the atoms that are released out of the radio radioactivity from these minerals."

new vaccine against cancer cancer can teach immune immune immune to "see" evil cells
a new cancer cancer vaccine vaccine can teach the immune immune immune system to "see" evil cells and kill them
as part of the vaccine vaccine therapy teaches the immune immune immune system how to recognise evil cells - as part of the vaccine
the use of this method, immune cells are obtained from the patient, which are transformed in the laboratory
They will then be able to "see" the protein, which is typical for many malignant tumors, and will be injected back into the body
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of malignancies.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system how to recognize evil cells, experienced that her ovarian cancer had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting cells from the patient’s immune system, converting them into a laboratory cell to be able to “see” the HER2 multi-tumor protein, and then injecting these cells back into the body.
In Bethesda, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, Maryland, Professor Jay Berzofsky said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
cancer of the breast, ovary, lung, and colon and rectum, explained Professor Berzovsky.
a similar approach, where immune cells are obtained from the patient, which have been ‘trained’ to attack malignant tumour cells, has been shown to be effective in one type of leukaemia.
After visiting SNL, Kanye West, dressed in MAGA’S hat, attacked Trump’s critics.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was whispered at the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for the 2020 presidential election.
After completing the third song that night, titled "Ghost Town," during which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he began to whisper loud phrases about the democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
so many times, when I talk to white white people, they ask, "How can you like Trump Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, then I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody of Matt Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the material with Vesta's regrets was uploaded on social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock tried to ridicule Vesta in this way.
And West complained to the audience that he had been mistreated behind the scenes because of his headpiece.
"They laughed me behind the scenes!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat hat on your head!"
They laughed me laughed me!
And they said I've lost touch with reality," West West said, according to the Washington Examiner.

"Variety" reported that his comments caused the audience to whistle at least twice, but the members of the show team looked confused, and at least one person told the press: "The studio was completely silent."
West had been invited at the last minute to replace singer Arianna Grande, who had died a few days ago a friend of hers, rapper Max Miller (Mac Miller).
West bewildered many with the song (I Love it), which he performed in the costume of a bottle of champagne.
Vesta was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the strongest people in the spirit: THANK YOU that YOU DO NOT WANT THE PUSH!"
Karen Hunter, the host of the show, Karen Hunter, tweeted on Twitter that West West “was who he was, and that’s wonderful.”
"But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his 'art') who, I believe, supports and barks with an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
And we too," she added.
Before this show ra ra ra ra ra ra rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name on Twitter, saying he had now become "a presence previously known as Kanji Kanji West West previously known as Kanji West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
Snoop the Lion of Snoop the Lion, and, of course, the late musical legend Prince Prince, changed his name by a symbol, but then to "the stage artist formerly known as Prince Prince".

"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harrington turns against toxic masculinity.
Kit Harrington is known as John Snow, the sword-drawn John Snow, in HBO's merciless medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to lay down rules for the application of the provisions of this Directive, in particular as regards the conditions for the exercise of the rights conferred by Community law in the field of competition law and the conditions for the exercise of those rights.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt explained that he thought there was a "problem" and asked how to deal with toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that this problem was important to him.
"I can't help but think about what mistakes we have made with the masculinity," he said.
"What do we teach young men in this aspect of the problem as they grow up, given the existing problem?"
Kitt believes that television with its very masculine characters may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.

What is being taught on TV and in the streets and in the streets, what makes young boys feel that they must be seen to be perceived as men?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change this?
"Beca in with the young men there are clearly problems."
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any sequel or prequel to Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses are fed up".
Starting from November, Kitt will play the lead role in the revamped "True West" by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother the robber.

The couple got married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS has risen sharply by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820 000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
“I don’t know if I’m going to do it, but I’m going to do it.”
Traditionally, HIV has rapidly spread to some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who became infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials informed at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 people.
HIV transmission as a result of sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Given the conservative values of the state, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of underprotected sex in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a series of measures to address the problem.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Maxine Waters denies that the employee leaked the data of Republican senators, sharply turns against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
(b) the Member State concerned has notified the Commission of its intention to notify the other Member States and the Commission of its intention to notify the other Member States of the measures taken pursuant to paragraph 1;
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the allegations were being spread by ultra-right wing whistleblowers and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more despicable lies," Waters insisted in a statement on Twitter.
U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah, U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, U.S. Sen.
The information appeared online on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from Congress, at the time of a hearing in the Senate Group on the allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour by Bret Caveno, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred some time after three senators had interviewed Caveno.
Conservative, internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of records is linked to Waters’ office, and disclosed information about a Waters staff employee, Hills reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and a complete lie!", insisted Waters.
"A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and untruthful statements shall in no way be liable for any leaks.
This groundless claim is absolutely false and a complete lie!"
Waters’ announcement soon sparked online criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
"This is an angry denial," Fleisher wrote.
It allows us to conclude that her temperament does not correspond to that of a member of Congress.
When a man is accused of something he has not done, that man should not be angry.
He must not be belligerent.
He may not comment on the motives of the accuser.
He must be calm and calm and calm."
Fletcher's task was to compare Waters' reaction with the fall of the Democrats for Judge Caveno, who was accused of overly angry reaction during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for Waters to lose her seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great, if true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters informed that her cabinet had alerted officials and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be found," she continued, "and that they will be held legally liable for all of their deeds that are destructive and dangerous to any of the employees of my staff."
"Johnny English 3" review — Rovan Atkinson's spy movie parody half-circle left behind.
It has become customary to seek associations with Brexite in every new British-flavoured film, and this seems to also apply to this revived comedy adventure comedy franchise of Johnny English, which began with "Johnny English" in 2003 and was revived in 2011 with "Johnny English returns".
Is there a new export opportunity for our nation, or a new export opportunity for our nation? Is there a new opportunity to export our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Angle with well-eyed eyes and an unusually moving face has the right to create a mess after the second revival — his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad-spectrum comic character, designed for areas where consumers don’t speak English.
He is, of course, that stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims to charming sophistication, is a little Cluzo, a little Mister Bean, and a little bit of that guy playing one note in the music of "Chariots of Fire" at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He is also based on the traveler and the international, incomprehensible character that Atkinson once portrayed in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, in which he left chaos on his way.
In the latest adventure of Johnny England, there are at least one or two lovely moments.
I liked the place where Johnny Anglis goes to the helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the blades of the propeller creep for a moment against his helmet.
Atkinson's ability to visually create a comic impression is well visible, but humor is rather weak and strangely superficial, especially since "serious" film brands, such as "007" and "Mission Impossible", themselves confidently use comedy as one of the components.
Humor gives the impression that it is dedicated to children, not adults, and I think Johnny Angle's absurd troubles are not as creative and purposeful as Atkinson's silent movie tricks in Bean's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyberhacker has hacked into the British secret internet network of superspy spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in this field, to the displeasure of an active agent — the deplorable little role played by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a prime minister, a pompous and conflict-stricken person who has already lost all political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing what she can with a character like Theresa May, but there isn’t much to do in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since all active spies have come to light, she will have to summon someone who has already retired.
And this man is the incompetent Johnny Anglis, who now works as a teacher in a fine educational institution and quietly teaches how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because Anglis offers to learn the profession of spy from the very foundations.
The coal coal is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former Bo, his many former assistant Bo, also played by Ben Miller (Ben Miller).
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a fun character who only becomes important at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully used.
Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of Her Majesty and meet the beautiful fateful woman Ophelia Bulletova, portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, prime ministers are dangerously obsessed with the charismatic technology billionaire, evil Jason Walt, portrayed by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problem.
The Coal and Bo begin their odyssey of wild fun: masquerading as waitresses, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create confusion by sneaking into a luxury yacht in Volta; and the Coal causes absolute chaos by trying to use a virtual reality head-on display to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta building.
Everything possible is done for the final process, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, it contains many elements of children's television.
A lot of moderate elements.
just like in other Johnny An An Anglin films, I cannot but wonder if the British film industry could give Rovan Atkinson a role that would take his talent to the full.
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn The Labour Party is about to discuss a radical plan, according to which the British will work four days a week, but will get a salary for five.
It is reported that the party wants company executives to allocate the savings saved through the artificial intelligence revolution to workers by giving them another holiday.
In this case, the employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend, while receiving the same salary as before.
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market (DSM) and the Digital Single Market (DSM).
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trades Union Congress, which sees it as an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior representative of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "The policy changes are expected to be announced by the end of this year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day week is an idea that is in line with the party's goal of balancing the economy for the workers and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week already in the 2017 general election campaign.
I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do it again.
A representative of the Labour Labour party said: "The four-day work week is not part of party politics and the party does not consider it."
John McDonnell, Minister of the Shadow Cabinet, used the Labour Conference last week to shape his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell explained that he was determined to take power away from the "masses of directors" and the "speculators" of the public service company.
The Shadow Cabinet Minister’s plan also means that the existing average shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire package, because the Labour government could make a “deduction” because of the injustices committed.
He also approved plans to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and to create exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees who would receive dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsey Gra Gram and John John F Kennedy answer "60 Minutes " 60 Minutes " or the FBI's investigation into Caveno
An investigation by the FBI into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question whether the findings of the office could lead a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In a 60 Minutes interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent for the show, questioned Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could discover something that would change their minds.
Kennedy left a more open human impression than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy replied.

What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to alleviate poverty? What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday, this year, the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world, will take place in New York City.
This is the festival’s seventh year, tens of thousands of people will gather in the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an event set up by the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people active in the fight against poverty.
To receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was a wish to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "activities", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant activity to raise awareness of the end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert for a free concert a good way to persuade people to take action, or is it just another case of so-called "cclikticticism" when people feel that they really have what they can influence by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters in pursuit of various goals.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and announcements arising from its operations for which at least USD 10 billion USD 10 billion had already been disbursed or funded.
The group estimates that the allocated funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and enforcers committed to "helping children grow up to their full potential", promising to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after more than 4700 Twitter messages were received from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can leave the social injustices of malnutrition behind," Tracey Ullman of The Power of Nutrition told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also mentioned that after launching more than 5,000 measures calling on the UK government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government announced funding for the "Power of Nutrition" project, which will provide nutrition to 5 million women and children.
Responding to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website—"What do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen commented: "It will be a long and long road, where we will stumble and fail at times.
But just as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements have done before us, we will also succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to "blockade" Russia's energy exports, the interior minister said.
"If necessary," Washington may use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria – especially in places where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – are a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason why it is in the Middle East is because it wants to supply energy in the same way it does in Eastern Europe, southern southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its na na na na na na na navy, can ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them, so that Russia cannot bring its energy energy to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed an audience who had come to attend an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with the situation in Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are virtually the same.
"The economic opportunity for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, referring at the same time to Russia as a country whose economy depends mainly on fossil fuels.
Claims are made that the Trump administration is promoting the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
Trump’s administration officials, as well as US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which would, according to Trump, make Berlin “dependent” from Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has expressed its opposition to Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was seriously considering running for president after midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for the presidential election.
"It's time for women in Washington, D.C. to "speak up" an imperfect government, which means a female president," so her words are reported in The Hill newspaper.
"After November 6 November, after November 6 November, I will carefully consider my can stand in the US presidential election."
Warena referred to President Donald Donald Trump Trump, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
“I’m deeply concerned to the bottom of my heart what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been openly critical of Trump and his selected Supreme Court nominee, Brett Caveno.
Warena said on Twitter on Friday Friday: “Of course, an FBI investigation is needed before the election.”
However, a survey published on Thursday revealed that the majority of Warren’s supporters do not believe she should stand for the 2020 elections.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters, according to a survey by the Center for Political Research/Boston Globe at the University of Suffolk, said that a senator should not stand for election.
Thirty-two percent supported such a decision.
The results of the survey showed that former governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, receiving 38 percent for standing as a candidate and 48 percent against.
In connection with a possible candidacy in the 2020 election, such high-profile Democratic Party names as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders appear.
The news agency "Associated Press" informed that Biden is committed to give a formal decision by January.

18 states, District of Columbia, District District of Columbia challenges a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new US policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of these 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a brief briefing to a court advisor in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker facing the obstacles created by the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of his violent gang member" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was apprehended in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are a common problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the Immigrant Appeals Board’s decision of 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney-General of the District of Columbia, Karl Karl Raccin on Friday said the new policy “ignignigns decades-old national, federal, and international laws.”
"Federal law provides that all asylum applications are examined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the court advisor said in a brief statement.
In addition, in his presentation, he said that a policy of denying immigrants entry is detrimental to the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions addressed immigration judges in June with a request to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse.
"Association is open to persons who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Sezons in his political statement on 11 June.
Shelter has never been intended to solve all the problems, even all the serious ones, that people face every day around the world.

clean water is a deficit."
The residents were visible when they returned to their destroyed homes and shoveled over the things soaked in water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that had been affected by the 7.5-magnitude strong earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harry, who had a broken spine and shoulder, slept outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being cared for outdoors because of the constant violent aftershocks.
His eyes were filled with tears, remembering how the powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
It seems that I was printed in the ruins of the wall," Harry told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
"I hope they are safe and hope they are safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of trying to intimidate by means of propaganda advertisements.
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad, daily highlighting the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement to the Iowa-selling newspaper Des Moines Register, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6th US Congress elections, which China denies.
The accusation made by Trump that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters, namely that it was a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently plunged into a growing trade war, as a result of which they impose a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
China’s repressive tariffs against exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural commodities to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion in the "Des Moines Register" Sunday's Des Moines Register, claiming that China China "now doubles this intimidation by posting propaganda propaganda ads in our own free free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the tradition of freedom of speech and free press to America's advantage by posting a paid ad, 'Des Moines Register,'" Branstad wrote.
"Here, however, at the usual Beijing news kiosk you will find a limited number of different views and you will not see such a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have in connection with China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is here under the strict supervision of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential newspapers in China avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
analysts warn of Republicans who alien women voters from mid-term elections involving Caveno scandal
Since many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will face a negative reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to lay down rules for the functioning of the internal market, in particular for the internal market and the internal market.
“These things cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School of Policy, Syracuse University of Syracuse, in an article published Saturday in the newspaper The Hill.
Richer doubts that senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push by R-Arizona for an FBI investigation will be a good enough reason to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive movement MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning protesters in the hallway of the Senate sang demonstratively "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who are in charge of the Judiciary Committee, chose to continue with the candidacy of Caveno, despite the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported "Mic."
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news portal.
"People say that it is already at a high level, it's true.
"But it could be even higher, especially between the fluccc and younger voters (aged 18-29) who often do not go to the election even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she set out allegations of sexual abuse on the part of a candidate for the position of the Supreme Court, analysts point to a possible failure if Republicans continue to nominate this candidacy.
"This has become a messy mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether or not Caveno will be convicted, it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with the situation and treated him," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, who heads the group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are a little divided as to what to believe according to the testimonies of Ford and Caveno, a little more inclined to believe the latter.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41 percent of respondents are either definitely or mostly inclined to believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they are definitely or mostly inclined to believe Caveno’s testimony.
38 percent also claimed that Caveno may or must have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian newspaper reported that the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, at the instigation of Flake.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Caveno had committed a drunken sexual assault on her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of a judge of the Supreme Court during his studies at Yale in the 1980s had shown her his genitals at a party in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to launch a new internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
"Inrupt", the latest project of technology legend, is a company based on the Berners-Lee open source platform "Solid".
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who is allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intent of Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"It is a historical moment."
The app uses Solid technology so that people can build their own “personal online data repository” or PTD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time in the same browser.
Your personal online data storage is unique in that only the user determines who and what type of information can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal authority with data-in-data."
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea behind “Inrupt” is to provide the company with the resources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently has Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-acquired security platform, some freelance developers hired to work on the project, and a community of voluntary encoder.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change by completely reversing all of their business models overnight.
cottage cottage cottage cottage cottage "We do not ask their permission."
Bernerers-Leee said in an article published on Saturday by the Medium platform that Inrupt “is mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality integrity and quality of the new Solid Solid Solid-Based Web.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in discussions about net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new web era," added Burners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Mark of the Victoria Cross awarded to a cl cler during the First World War during the First World War Mark Mark Mark Mark of the Victoria Cross awarded to a cl cler during the First World War
For 100 years now, in its hometown, an event has been celebrated when the only clergyman of the Church of England received the Victorian Cross as a fighter during the First World War.
Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Wen received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellengleise and Lehaucorta.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, so he never knew about the highest British military award he received.
In a Saturday parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons uncovered a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons Michael Vann mentioned that it was "excellently symbolic" that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received the significant award.
According to the London Gazette newspaper On 29 September 1918, on 29 September 1918, Li Li Li Li Col Col Col Col Col Col Col Col Col Col Col L Lwenwenwen Vnn led his battaltaltal battal over the Canal de Saint Saint-Quentin "through large fires caused by very thick fog and cannon and machine guns and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the shooting line and guided it with the greatest daringness ahead of the cannon zone, where he defeated three groups.
Colonel Lieutenant-Colonel Venus was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Venn (722) said that the actions of his grandfather were "something I could never do, and which at the same time is also a very humble act".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a wreath after the parade with the accompaniment of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vnn stated that he felt "hon honoured to take part in this para para parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evidenced by the support provided by so many people".

Imagine spending the whole night upstairs to see Bellator 206, but in the end you are not allowed to watch this main event.
The San Jose poster included 13 battles, including six on the main map, which were broadcast live all night long on UK Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were shocked by the switch to Puppy Pup.
Some were really puzzled when they had stayed awake all night until the early dawn, waiting for the battle.
A fan on Twitter described the change of the broadcast to a children's cartoon as a "unfortunate joke".
"The government has determined that this type of content is not acceptable after 6:00 a.m., so there was a switchover to a children's program," Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President Marketing and Communications, Bellator, explained the change of transmission.
"Piggy Pepa," "yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said he will be working on scheduling so that future viewers in the UK can see these broadcasts.
"Thinking about repeating the broadcast, I think we will be able to somehow solve it," said Cocker.
"But the clock is there at six in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday at our time and Monday at their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, after the changeover of the transmission a lot of texts appeared, and they were not positive.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't. It was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that next time there will be no such problems.
We will stick to five fights instead of six (as it has been so far). We tried to please the fans, but we tried our best.
It's a failed situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley did not feel good enough about his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
24-year-old man was unaware that "not everyone is like me" until he started high school.
Speaking on his first Radio 4 program, Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had begun to talk about homosexual rights in order to give others "hope".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent manager of the Long-Term Program, has gone on several months of rest due to illness.
appearing as an excluded from society on La Laverne's first Lavernes program, Daley said that he felt "feed inferior" to others when he grew, "because it is not accepted in society that both girls and boys can please."
He said, "To this day, the feeling that I am not as good as others, or that I am different, or that I am not as good as others, has been the main driving that has given me strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that there was "something" so as not to disappoint people when they finally learn about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-level leader of the LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for even more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had decided to address the public because he felt happy that he was able to live openly and uncomplicated, and he wanted to give "hope" to others.
Dustin Lance Black Black, a US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black Black, whom he met in 2013, said he was "surprurured unpreprepped" when he fell in love with a man Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-oldest Oscar winner last year and claimed that the age gap was never an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much at such a young age" (his first Olympic Games were at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone at your age who has experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"All that was important to me a year ago was getting a gold medal," he said.

Daley mentioned that his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked Daley was whether they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, where he wanted to be in the front row.
"I could not tell him that she would no longer be in the first row to be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, did I finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed my whole my life - to plunge into the front of my home in the Olympics. There wasn't any better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song — Heather Small's "Proud", which resonated with him on the road to achievement at the Olympic Games and continues to win the goosebumps.

Michaels Mickelson from the form in the reserve bench in Saturday Raiders Cup Hand
Phil Mickelson will set a record by playing his 47th Raider Cup match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a bad turn of events.
In the event of a dispute between a Member State and a third country concerning the interpretation or application of this Regulation, the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, adopt implementing acts laying down the detailed rules for the application of this Regulation.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has so often been the case with U.S. teams, the five-time winner split his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of correcting what is bothering him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the peak of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the tense fight in the uneven field of Le Golf National, where inaccurate kicks are regularly punished.
And if the game itself isn’t scary enough, Mikelson will fight the exact winner of the British Open in Sunday’s ninth match, Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If Americans, who are four points behind in starting 12 singles games, succeed in the lead, the Mikkelson match could prove to be crucial.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
"He was fully aware of his role today, slapped my back, put his hand on me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
sheltered habitat "He is very confident in himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who has given so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
I think I hadn't imagined him playing two matches.
I imagined more, but everything swirled as it swirled, and that's what we're going to count on.
He wants to be there out there, like all the others."
Mikelson will hand Nick Faldo the record for the most played matches in the Raider Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Raider Cup, which has never really coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furik claimed that his presence gave the team some intangible benefits.
"He is cheerful, sarcastic and witty, he likes to have fun on people, and he is a great teammate," he explained.
"In my opinion, the younger players liked to tease him this week too, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than mere mere play of play."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the superstitious European team, knows that a significant rise in leadership can quickly fade away.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in order to lay down detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation.
Dany made his debut at the 1997 Games in Valderrama, where the opposing team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, scored a five-point lead over the Americans, but only now reached the finish line with a very small dot lead, winning with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we were significantly ahead in Valderrama; we were ahead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only with a small lead," said Bjorn (pictured), watching the 2018 graduation group victory with 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday, taking the lead with 10-6 on the golf course "Le Golf National".
Thus, history will show me and every member of its team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will give up all of yourself.
Go to the square and show your best performance and your best performance!
It will not be over until you see the points you have scored on the screen.
Our goal is to get this trophy and let's focus on that.
I've always said I've been focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware who on the other side is opposing us — the world's greatest players."
Facilitated by the performance of his players on the golf course, Björn added: "I never had a good time too early.
Tomorrow, there will be new challenges.
Tomorrow designed for individual games, and it's a completely different thing.
It is great if in moments when everything is going well, you have a partner next to you, but in individual games your golfer's skills are fully tested.
This is the message you need to give to your players, so that they can give up all of themselves in the next day’s game.
Now you are leaving your partner, and he must also go to show his best performance."
Captain of the opposing team Jim Furik, Jim Furik, will make sure his players show their best performance in individual games, not in partner games. Except only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furik himself has been on both sides of these major tournaments of the last few days, both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn, and then suffered a defeat when European teams achieved a sensational success, later known in the golf world as "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, 1999 captain of the team, teamed up his players for the last day's battle.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get straight to the fast-paced momentum you experienced in Brooklyn, like you experienced in Medina.
When such a pulse is transmitted in one direction, it exerts a lot of pressure on the midfield games.
We made our line and ranked the guys in the way we thought it right, and we'll try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counter-attack, and he ranked Rory McIlroy in the main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter
"I ranked the guys in this order because I think it fits best in the tournament," said Bjorn in relation to the selected singles players.
German new German new warship German new German warship put into service again delayed
The latest frigate of the German navy was due to be put into operation in 2014, replacing the aging Cold War warships, but this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the frigate class of Baden-Württemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a representative of the military.
The ship was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but the unpleasant after-delivery problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the navy back in 2007 will replace the old Bremen frigates of the Bremen class.
It is expected that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signal reception.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to accommodate new frigates for up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the constant delay means that the warships of the latest technology, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries, will already be obsolete by the time they are put into operation, "Die Zeit" notes.
The failed frigate F125 last year was noticeable in all the headlines when the German navy formally refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the shipyard "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship back to the shipyard after it had been delivered.
The reasons for this step were little known, but German media reported a number of significant "software and equipment defects" that would make a warship unfit if it were used on a combat mission.
Software-deficiencies were a particularly significant factor, as ships in the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 seafarers, which is only half of the personnel of the senior Bremen-class frigates.
Also it turned out that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to make its improvements in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-tonne ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by Germany during the Second World War.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the whole project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
It has cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion instead of the originally planned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of the recent warnings about the shrinking of the German navy.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament’s Defence Committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the navy is indeed “starting to run out of usable vessels”.
The official claimed that over time this problem has grown significantly, as the old vessels are taken out of operation, but new ones are not delivered to the site.
He regretted that none of the frigate class in Baden-Württemberg had joined the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats.
A new study, conducted on a Scottish Highland property, aims to discover how bats use the landscape in their food search process.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to assist in their future conservation efforts.
In the Invereves Gardens of the Scottish National Trust in Westeros, scientists will study dwarf bats, pigeon bats, as well as brown albacores and water bats.
Special recorders will be placed in the main places of the property, which will track the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Sound experts will analyze all records to determine the frequency of bat calls and which species carries out the specific activity.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed landscape view that reflects the behavior of the bats.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of meadows, and how best to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the last century, the bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably.
These lands are threatened by construction and development works that affect the shelters of bats and the loss of their habitat.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypaper and chemical treatments for some building materials, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated echo-location method to locate insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bat problem very seriously.
The organisation has at its disposal ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of bat shelters and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization has even established the first and only special bat reserve in Scotland, Threave, in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten bat species found in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says that this area is perfect for bats, and that it is the perfect place for bats.
"Here is a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a generally suitable habitat.
But there are still a lot of things we don't know about bat bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He emphasizes that it is important to check that there are no bats in the area before the maintenance of the property is carried out, because it may happen that up to 400 females and their young are killed as a result of the unintentional destruction of one of the shelters of the females, possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and should not be killed, tortured, disturbed or destroyed in their hiding places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a staff member of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, has called on the public to help.
She said: "We still have much to learn about bat bats, and for several of their species we simply do not know how they are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges by ordering lawyers to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned the rape accusation against him as "fake news", claiming that people "want to get their attention" by using his name.
His lawyers have been appointed to sue the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published these allegations.
A football star of Portuguese origin and Juventus footballer of Turin is accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have paid a woman <0x24>375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
A few hours after making these claims, Ronaldo, 33, turned to his 142 million followers via Instagram's online video, calling the information "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is fake news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, that's part of my job.
I am a happy person and everything is fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldu attorneys are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine for what they have described as "pro providing inadmiss privacy privacy privacy-suppp ", Ronald's lawyers are preparing to su Der Spiegel magazine.
Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to the extent corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in a suite.
According to documents filed to the Clark County Court in Nevada, it is reported that after reading in the nightclub Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's hotel room, where he anally raped a woman.
Majorga says that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and said that he was "99 percent good boy" but fell into the temptation of that "one percent".
In accordance with the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but this was done by mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries in hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to lay down detailed rules for the application of this Regulation.
In the moment when these claims were made, Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer he switched to Italian grand Juventus for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK "forever regret" loss of automakers
"The United Kingdom will 'repent forever' if, after Brexit, it loses its position as the world leader in car manufacturing," said business secretary Greg Clark.
They are "disconcerted" by the fact that Toyota UK has announced to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily suspend production at Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clarke said.
The Japanese automaker said that delays at the borders in the case of Brexit without an agreement could put jobs at stake.
Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota models "Auris" and "Avensis", last year produced almost 150 000 cars, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, "BMW" claims that after Brexit will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month.
According to car manufacturers, the main concern is the threat to the supply chain if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "track in time" basis, where cars made to order receive parts from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be interference at the border, which could cause some delays and shortages.
According to the company, Toyota would not have been able to detain more than one day’s worth of inventory at its factory in Derbyshire, and would have had to stop production.
Theresa May’s Chequers plan for her future relations with the EU was “pre-preprecisely calculated in order to avoid such border checks”.
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that would allow, as I would say I would say, to benefit not only at the present moment, but also take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio Radio 4 Radio 4 on "Today".
"A testimony not only from Toyota Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be able to fully continue our very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota could not say how long production could be halted, but warned that rising costs in the long run would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately put jobs at risk.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston, Burnaston for 24 years and works in the factory as coordinator of union union un unification, said that his members are becoming increasingly worried: "I can say from experience that as soon as a position disappears, it does not come back."
a representative of the government said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump Trump Trump Trump's Treffen mit Rosenstein Rosenstein könnte wieder verschoben verschoben - White White House White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “delayed for another week” as the battle over Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Caveno continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in the Russian elections, the link between Trump’s means and Russia, as well as possible violations of the rule of law by the president.
For months in Washington, D.C., there have been rumours about whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby threaten Miller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed recording a conversation with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president with Amendment 25.
I don’t know if I’m going to do it again.
But last Monday he went to the White House, where there were talks about his resignation.
Instead, it was announced that it would meet on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Trump said that "it would be better" not to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where both Caveno and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct — Dr. Christine Blazey Ford — testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Caveno’s allegations, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was visiting "Fox News Sunday" on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, taking into account all the things that are happening around the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters dispute this statement: Sanders hasn’t held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why. Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of brief brief briefs was not due to dislike of the television reporter's "gre fa falust", although she added: "I do not deny the fact that they are greed."
Next, she suggested direct contact between Trump and the press, which would increase the interest of the press.
"The president is involved in more question-and-ans-sessions than any president before him," she said, adding, without giving further details, "We have inquired the number."
Sanders said the briefings will continue to happen, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States direct questions, it is certainly better than talking to me.
We're trying a lot to do a lot of things, and you can see that we've done a lot of this over the last many weeks, and it's going to take the place of press brief brief brief brief briefings, when you'll be able to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions by leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences attended by key figures.
Individual press conferences are rarely held.
It is possible that the President demonstrated the reason for it this week in New York, devoting an uncontrolled and sometimes strange expression to the crowd of reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to EU staff in the Scottish NHS about the fears associated with Brexit.
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working for the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish them strength after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to the MSF less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applications for permanent status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal continued, which led to decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know that this is a very uneasy time for you.
In the event of a breach of the provisions of this Regulation, the Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of the reasons for the breach.
Colleagues from inside and outside the EU provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit the patients and communities we care for.
'Scotland Scotland is definitely your home and we'd very much want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Christian Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency operation.
Tennessee state Tigers guard Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after a head injury, which he scored in a Saturday game in which he lost to Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31-27, reported Tennessean sports reporter Mike Organ.
In the event of an emergency, the competent authority of the host Member State shall immediately inform the competent authority of the host Member State of the emergency.
"He came to the side line and so to say collapsed," said Reid.
While Abercrombie was on the side line, the trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen, then put him on a stretcher and took him for further investigation.
A Tennessee state official told a Nashville-based WSMV reporter, Chris Harris, that Abercrombie had been removed from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Abercrombie, the representative of the red shirt, is in his first season after the replacement of Ilionise for the Tennessee State team.
Before leaving the Saturday game he had made a total of five blocks, which in this season made a total of 18.
foreign foreign buyers foreign buyers will have to pay a higher state fee when buying property in the UK
foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the UK, and the extra funds raised will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plan.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
Increased state duty will be applied to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The State Treasury predicts that up to 120 million pounds can be collected annually, which can be used to provide assistance to the homeless.
foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state duty when buying property in the UK and diverting the extra funds gained to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
Such a move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract new voters with promises of affordable housing and to reach out to the wealthiest part of society.
Increased state duty will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and in addition to the money raised, it will be spent on government efforts to combat the problem of homelessness.
The surcharge included in the current state fee, including the higher level of the surcharge introduced two years ago for the purchase of a second home and the purchase for renting, could be as much as three percent.
I don’t know if I’m going to do it, but I’m going to do it.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built properties are bought by non-residents, thus slapping prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get their own home.
Many areas of the wealthy country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut so more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by grabbing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to address Britain’s housing problem.
Mr. Corbin has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including a reform of rent control and eviction without cause.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new housing.
Mrs May said: "Last year I mentioned that I would use my position as Prime Minister to restore the British dream that every young generation should have a better quality of life.
And that means putting our damaged housing market in order.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not correct that housing can be equally easily purchased by foreign companies and non-UK residents, as well as hard-working British citizens.
The dream of a home has become too distant for many people, and the rough homelessness problem is still a problem."

Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that his biggest goal is to become a manager of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge to recreate the Northeast club, which is currently ranked third in the first league with three points from above.
This summer, he switched to the "Stadium of Light" after staging St Mirren back at the Scottish Premier League last season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I won the B Cup, and that was it," Ross told the Scottish BBC's "Sportsound" broadcast.
"But I grew up watching Scotland games in Hampden Park with my father, and that has always called for me to come back.
However, such an opportunity would only be possible if I was successful in the club management."
Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Canio Canto, and Dio Paulo Canet are among Ross's predecessors in the management of the Sunderland.
The former Alloa Athletic chief says he has not been disturbed by following in the footsteps of such a large club's top managers, having previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich.
"My success will now be judged on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Due to the structure and capabilities of this club, it undoubtedly fits into the prime prime minister," he said.
"Returning the club to the premiere will not be an easy task, but I will most likely believe that I will be successful here only when this task is accomplished."
Ross has only been in his managerial career for the third year in a row, having previously served some time as deputy director in Dumbarton and spent a 15-month period as a hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling to the third level and helped St Mirren win the championship in the same season.
Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than during his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"They were probably a real crossroads," he recalls taking responsibility for "Alloa".
"I really believed that leadership was my real calling — far more appropriate than playing.
Sounds strange, because I had a good success, I was able to live from it and also enjoy it at certain heights.
However, playing can be difficult.
Every week you have to go through a lot of things.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but leadership is my field.
I have always wanted to lead and now I do it. I feel that I am in the right place, I have not felt so well all my life."
You can listen to the full "Sportsound" interview on Sunday 30 September on Scottish Radio Scotland Radio from 12 noon to 13 noon British Summer Time on Sunday 30 September.
A survey has found that the best time to enjoy pints is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday evening.
The summer heat wave has caused Britain's less popular pubs to shrink, but it has put increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales of pubs and bars had increased by 2.7 per cent, while in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, who represents CGA, the business consulting agency that compiled the data, said: “Continuously sunny weather and England’s protracted participation in the World Cup meant that July followed the same trend as June, with pub profits up 2.8 per cent and restaurants falling.
Restaurants, whose sales fell by 1,8 per cent in June, experienced an even more difficult situation in July.
The situation in the drink pubs and bars was the most appreciative, as they experienced a much greater upturn than restaurants experienced a downturn.
Food-based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurant workers felt.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In p ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta in in p ta ta bars and bars, the sales of beverages increased per month by 6.6 per per per month, while the sales of food decreased by 3 per per per per per per cent."
Paul Newman, an analyst for recreation and hospitality at RSM, said: “These results continue the trend observed at the end of April.
weather conditions and the impact of large-scale social or sporting events are the major factors determining the turnover in the non-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the corresponding period of the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the constant cost pressure.
As for food providers, a long and hot summer could not have come at a more inopopopponable moment, and time will tell whether the milder temperatures we usually experience in August will provide much-needed res res res res."
Overall sales growth among pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a drop in brand sales.
The "Coffer Peach Tracker", which is the sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion and is a well-established industry benchmark.

views are divided about the advertising of a breast milk pump pump pump for breast milk, which compares mothers with cow cows
The breast milk pump manufacturing company has taken care of divided opinions online in connection with advertising, in which nursing mothers are compared with milking cows.
To celebrate the launch of the so-called "world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ad for a sticky meadow to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
four real mothers four real mothers dance in a wall-filled cow-s h huh-and-wall at a song whose words read something like this: "Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy no no no no no no no tail no tail no tail no you see no tailyyy andandandandandifififififififififififififififififnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn not not not notyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
In the Singing continues: "Suck out, suck out, suck out, I feed babies, suck out, suck out, suck out, suck out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page has caused widespread resonance online.
77 000 times viewed and hundreds of times commented on, the video has received divided viewer feedback, and many claim that it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"Very wrong decision to use cows to advertise a product.
“Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after they were born,” one wrote.
breast pump pump Elvie breast breast pump fits discreetly into bra breastfeeding breastfeeding Elvie/Mother (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentary states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
Why don't we use them to promote a breast pump pump pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
There was also the opinion: "Ad creators didn't know what they they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "funny".
shelter "I think it's a brilliant idea.
"I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.
Milk suction made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understood the idea behind it.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commentary states: "This is a fun ad for moms who milk milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like a cow."
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the promotion, a group of women discover that they all danced with the inconspicuous pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who milk milk claim to feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is completely quiet, has no wires and pipes, and fits discreetly into the bra for breastfeeding women, allowing them to move freely, keep their babies and even take part in events outside the house.
Anna Balarin, "Mother" partner and creative director, commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch on the market.
parallel between women who milk milk and dairy cows and milk cows, we wanted to pay attention to milk milking, while entertaining and understandable, demonstrating the stunning sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
It's not the first time that the Elvie pump has come to the spotlight.
At London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the tongue on the show of Martha Jakubowski, using this product.
hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border of Texas
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, even though as many people cross the border each month as in the past, partly due to the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it more difficult for children to stay with sponsors.
Usually, most of the sponsors were also immigrants without papers themselves, fearing that if they openly applied for the adoption of a child, this would jeopardise their chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to take fingerprints, and this data would be passed on to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement officer, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons had not been previously punished.
Almost 80 percent of the persons who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors’ household, stay here illegally, and a large proportion of these persons are criminal aliens.
So we continue to persecute such individuals," Mr. Albens said.
According to asylum officials, in an effort to speed up the handling of child cases, officials have introduced new rules stipulating that some of them will have to appear before the court within one month of their detention instead of 60 days as stipulated in the previous standard.
Many will use the videoconferencing call option instead of coming personally to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons who will be deemed unfit to obtain release will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are held in custody, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent attacks or attempts to flee, according to information provided by asylum staff and testimonies retrieved from the system in recent months.
Lawyers claimed that these concerns are intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked due to their breadth.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without spending enough time emotionally preparing them or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends could cause injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria Syria forces the US, French and Turkish "in the occupying arm armies" to withdraw their troops immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is already in its eighth year.
Mouualemem, who also serves as deputy prime deputy prime prime prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally in Syria under the pre pretext of counter-terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They should resign immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 360 000 people have died and millions millions have been forced to flee their homes since 2011 "the war against terrorism is almost over".
Damask will continue to "bat in the holy war until all Syrian Syrian territories are cleared" from both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States of America has deployed some 2,000 troops to Syria, mainly training and advising both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem stated that the conditions were excellent for them to return and blamed "separate Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears", which made the refugees unwilling to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States of America and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction assistance until an agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone on the last pillar of the rebels in Idlib has made it possible to speed up political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement "has deadlines" and hoped that military action would be directed against jijihadists, including fighters from Al-Qaeda-linked group Jabhat al Nusrah, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committees, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, in order to draft a Syrian constitution for the post-war period and pave the way for elections.
Moualem placed conditions on the participation of the Syrian state in the committee, stressing that the work of the group should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Trump Trump will be elected for a second term Why Trump Trump will be elected for a second term
From this point of view, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 elections, unless, and this is probably what many liberal observers hope, impeachment and scandal will not prematurely put an end to his presidency.

Pre-ele election campaigns of the most ten-tight parliamentary mid-term elections money from outside money flows into pre-ele election campaigns
No wonder the 17th congressional constituency of Pennsylvania aspires to receive money thanks to the transformation of congressional districts, as a result of which the two existing deputies will fight for one seat.
Conor Lamb, a Democrat who took his place in a special election last spring in a different district, is linked to this recently reformed Pittsburgh suburb.
Lomb will fight with another current member of parliament, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans, the maps were reworked.
Competition in the new 17th district has led to a struggle between the parties’ main financial groups: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lemb became known in Pennsylvania when he won the March elections in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district with a small majority.
Republicans had held this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won in the area with 20 points.
Political experts expect democrats to have a small majority.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then rethinked
Diplomats admitted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and stayed at a hotel in Panama City until the partners threw the Trump Organization’s management team behind the door.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of the United States diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the grounds of "the recent decision not to recognise Taiwan any more", its department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were considered to be limited to El Salvador, which received about 140 million dollars from America in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include a reduction in financial assistance and a targeted restriction of visas, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and murder rates have reached the highest levels.
In the course of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, recognised as a rapprochement effort to prevent migrants moving to the US.
In mid-September, senior state officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially putting an end to the considerations of punishing El Salvador.
Diplomats informed that Vice President Mika Pence has now decided to attend a conference scheduled for mid-October to show how seriously the administration emphasizes the meeting.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or penalties from Washington.
The White House representative, who spoke on behalf of Mr. Bolton, was unwilling to provide more details about the debate that was described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to negotiate internally, provided their anonymity was maintained.
In the event of a dispute between the parties concerning the interpretation or application of the provisions of this Convention, the Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to rule on the interpretation or application of the provisions of this Convention.
Research into the history of phenomena
The second stone in the garden could be a report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller that Mr Trump may have obstructed justice, which has a lot of evidence at the disposal of the public.
It is said that Mr. Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If a second party prevails in Congress, Trump will have to answer to this body and possibly to a panel of his peers at the very moment when he is about to meet his electorate again.
There is a lot of "but", and I do not claim that the fall of Trump is inevitable, or that it will happen to his European counterparts.
There are choices that will have to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show you the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to coup against Hitler, if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid years of protracted carnage.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
American Americans are now faced with a number of such milestones.
What do we do if Mr Trump Trump fires Attorney General General Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Miller Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has had a hard time since it was reported that last year he proposed to secretly record a conversation with the president and wondered about his unfitness for the post.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
"How do we respond if the FBI investigation that Breta Caveno has just been requested by the FBI is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed as a judge of the Supreme Supreme Court despite his unfair testimony and credible allegations of sexual sexual assault?

If we do not survive all these challenges, democracy will have a long winter.
But I believe that we will succeed in all this by referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the very same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassies house.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with swastika.

"Rangers" star Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the fight against the Viennese "Rapid"
The Rangers will host the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the spectacular draw in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the Group G of the Europa League.
In the event of an emergency, the competent authority of the Member State in which the competent authority of the Member State of destination is situated may require that the competent authority of the Member State in which the competent authority of the Member State of destination is situated, or the competent authority of the Member State in which the competent authority of the Member State of destination is situated, provide the competent authority of the Member State of destination with the information referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1.
"We can rejoice at this, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old footballer.
"We went into the game believing that we would be able to make a good success and got this point.
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'm not going to do that.
They were probably better in the first half, but we got loose in the second half and were a better team.
And Thursday will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully we'll get three points, but it won't be an easy game, because they scored a good score in the previous game, but I'm sure with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue fighting and get good results.
Last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, was clearly difficult, but now you can notice new trends, about which I feel good.
The team is great and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
"I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, leave last season behind and succeed."
women women can not sleep because they worry about their pension savings women women do not sleep because they worry about their pension savings
Although the respondents clearly knew what kind of care they wanted to receive, few had discussed the issue with family members.
Approximately half of the individuals in a nationwide survey indicated that they did not talk to a spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent answered that they had talked about it with their children.
"People want to be cared for by family members, but they don't do anything to discuss it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Agency.
This is where we should start.
You can not prepare your family for the fact that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known well in advance.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Get your financial advisor involved. Your advisor can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with a sum of money to cover these costs, or securing your property – the key is that you have the money.
Create your own legal documents. Prevent legal battles before they even begin.
Talk to a health care plenipotentiary so that you have a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure the actions of specialists according to your wishes, if you are not able to express them on your own.
Consider also the possibility of granting a power of attorney in relation to finances.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of paying your bills if you are unable to do it on your own.
And do not forget the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is taken to the hospital for emergency care.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies or allergies?
Specify these facts in a written plan, so that such a situation does not surprise you unprepared.
"And it's not just about finances, it's also about who's the doctor," Martina said.
"What are the drugs used for?
Who will take care of the dog? Who will take care of the dog?
Just make sure that you have made such a plan."

earthquake earthquakes and tssun earthquakes and tss ts tsun earthquake in in in indondondondondondon
At least 384 people have been killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Pal Palu on Friday, according to government information, the number of casualties is expected to increase.
Due to devastated communications, rescuers have not been able to obtain any information from the Donggal area, which lies north of Palu and is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude strong earthquake.
More than 16,000 people in Palu were evacuated after a devastating natural disaster.
Here are the basic information about Pala and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. It is estimated that in 2017 it had a population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary, when the earthquake and tsunami broke out.
Donggala is an area that extends about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
It is estimated that in 2017, 299,200 people lived in the county, an administrative region that is part of the province.
Fishing and farming are the economic backbone of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal Donggal area.
Nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite bank of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongala have been repeatedly affected by the tsunami in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Donggal.
The Tsunami also hit the western part of Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic-active Pacific Ring of Fire, where earthquakes regularly occur.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsuns in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
hundreds of hundreds of people died on the island of Nia (Nia) off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude strong earthquake struck Java, Indonesia's most populated island, in the south, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake erupted near Padang city, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do it again.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, causing tsunami waves up to 10 metres high that devastated dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A near-surface earthquake hit the area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded of the destruction caused by the devastating earthquakes and tsunamis of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sarah Palinin's el elddd son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, is arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Peylin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report what she claimed had been a crime, he took her phone.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to lay down rules for the application of this Regulation, in particular as regards the conditions for the exercise of the right of free movement within the Union.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked if he pleaded guilty or found guilty, he declared that he was "not guilty for no guilt."
Peilins has been charged with three Class A offences, which can result in a one-year prison sentence and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which can result in a one-day prison sentence and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palatine has been charged with a criminal offence.
He was accused in December 2017 of assaulting his father Todd Pailein.
His mother Sarah Palin called the police and reported that an attack had taken place.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, delaying the report of domestic violence and carrying a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says that he has punched her with a fist in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Peylina for linking her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from Iraq.

Federal prosecutors federal prosecutors want to demand rarely used death sentence in New New New New York terror terror attack suspect suspect suspect suspect suspect suspect suspect suspect suspect suspect suspect in terrorist attack New New City New New New New New New New York state state
Sayfullo Saip Saipov is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City, New York, killing eight people, a rare form of punishment that has not been executed in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
30-year-old Saipov is said to have used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, where he shot down pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the execution, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious injury, as stated in the statement of intent to apply for the death penalty filed with the Southern District Court in New York.
According to a judicial document, both of these charges can lead to the death penalty.
In the weeks following the attack, the federal grand jury accepted the indictment of Saipov's prosecution in 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the purpose of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of cruelty and damage to motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and pre-plan and intent", prosecutors said Saipov's attack was "horshot, cruel, cruel and inhuman."

Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is now ten years since prosecutors at the Southern District Court in New York City have prosecuted a case that can lead to the death penalty.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.[citation needed]
The last execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple sentenced to death on charges of involvement in espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The death penalty in the electric chair was carried out on June 19, 1953, for the Rozenbergs couple.
According to court documents, as days and months passed, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack.
According to police information, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching a video of ISIS on his phone.
Police said he had also asked for permission to display the flag of ISIS in his chamber.
He has rejected 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal public advocates representing Saipov, said he was "quite naturally dissatisfied" with the indictment's decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty instead of accepting the admission of guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the injury to all parties involved," Patton explained.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
The Conservative MP declares that the conduct of Brexit negotiations should be entrusted to NAID<0xC5><0xBD>EL FARO<0xC5><0xBD>.
Nigel Farage during a protest today at a conservative conference promised to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former leader of Britain’s Independent Party (Independence Party) said that politicians should feel the anger of Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, told the march in Birmingham that Britain would have withdrawn a long time ago if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge that Mrs May will have to face in trying to consolidate her party of contradictions was demonstrated by Conservatives who support staying in the EU and joined a separate city-wide anti-Brexit protest.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain her compromise plan for the future of the relationship between Britain and the European Union (Chequers Compromise), and is under attack from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to stay in the EU, and also from the EU itself.
The Allies insisted that she would resolutely try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her offer and "chaos".
Mr. Boun, "Leave Means Leave" (Leave Means Leave) at a rally in Solihull, announced that he wants to throw May's plan into the chuck Chequers.
Er schlug vor, Mr. Farrage zum Ally zu machen und ihm die Verhandlungen mit Brüssel anzuvertrauen.
"If he had been at the table, we would have already left," Boun said.
Wellingborough MEP Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit Brexit, but we have to throw away the shit out May May's plan!"
justifying his opposition to the EU, he said: "We didn't fight to be scalcalpas!
We want to make our own laws in our own country!"
Mr Bounn ignored assumptions that public opinion may have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who actually do all the work and elect us.
Please give Chequers Chequers and start to listen."
Prime Prime Prime Prime Prime Ministers remain in place when they deliver on their promises, she added in a message to May: "Pri Prime Prime Ministers remain in place when they deliver their promises."
Mr Farage said the politicians at the rally must feel pressure if they are going to disregard the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us -- the people -- and our politicians," he said.
"They are trying to give Brexit Brexit Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let this."
In his message to a enthusiastic crowd, he fills: "I want you to put pressure on our politicians who are going to hand Brexit over.

In the meantime, the survivors marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Unknown activists greeted the Conservatives with anti-Brexit banners after the group meeting this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Workers' Party mocked the Conservatives about the security issues they experienced with the party's app at the start of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they are able to maintain IT system order and all their technology for Canada and yet, and yet, for an undivided border, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
It's an absolute farce."
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit,” he added.
Warren Warren 's Warren ' '
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider carefully” running for president in the United States after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at West Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November and running against GOP Republican Geoph Diel, who was vice-president of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that she will be the main one who will dare to stand against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters through the town hall since Trump took office.
A visitor asked her if she was planning to stand for the presidential election.
To which Warrennn replied that it was high time for "wowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowo

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after the team lets him beat Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Walter Botas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton it became clear that the work of the Mercedes team will play an important role in the race.
From the start, Botas started well and almost left Hamilton dry, defending his place in the first two trips and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first walked into the garage and left Hamilton's snipers to cope with the rest, this was most likely the deciding factor.

Max Verstappen began from the back row and at the end of the first circle was the seventh in his 21st birthday.
After that, he was in the lead of a large part of the race, as he focused the tires to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kimi Räikkönen in the fourth.
Eventually he arrived at lap 44 in the garage, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight laps, as Rijkonen was fourth.
This is a difficult day because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one to two," Hamilton said.
Body Language Very Bad Body Language It Was Very Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at Saturday's rally for her insistence not to divulge a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, in which she accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno of sexual harassment.
Spe speaking in West Virginia, the president didn't speak directly about Ford Ford's testimony to the Senate ju ju ju ju committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows the Senate that people there are "w evil, nawy, and unreliable."
"One that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in recent days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, nasty and unreliable people," he said.
When you read the press releases and the leaked information and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't do that.
Ich habe es nicht getan."
Orphaphare Remember Remember?
Dian Fein Feinsteinstein, have you leaked the information?
... remember remember her answer to the question... did you leak the document? — "Oh, oh, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
Ich habe es nicht getan."
Well, wait a moment.
In the event of a dispute between the parties, the dispute shall be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
In July, a letter was sent to Feinstein, explaining in detail what Ford accused Cavendish, and in early September the contents of the letter were disclosed, but Feinstein denies that it would have happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford Ford's accusations, I "didn't squander" her story," Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did that."
But her denial did not please the president, who commented on the situation at a Saturday evening rally in this way: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
I don't think she probably didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that democrats use the accusations to their advantage.
"They are purposefully determined to regain power by whatever means they may by whatever means."
Do you see the evil, the disorder, they don't care what they hurt, what they must destroy to gain power and control," the president said in a statement.

Air traffic controller dies by allowing hundreds of people on board to escape during an earthquake
A air traffic controller in Indonesia is praised for being a hero after he sacrificed himself so that an airplane with hundreds of passengers would safely take off from land.
Over 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue on the territory and many are trapped in the mud of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues saved their lives, the 21-year-old Antonio Ganavan Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the control tower of Palu Airport, which swayed violently.
He stayed in his post to make sure that the aircraft Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower, thinking that it might collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman, Johannes Sirait, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC news reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We are heartbroken when we hear this," he fills.
In the meantime, the state authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the national disaster prevention agency says access to Donggal, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It is believed that the beautiful will grow, because there are still many human corpses under the rubble, and many are not accessible," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reach a height of 6 meters, devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Defence military and commercial aircraft and commercial aircraft continue to provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old young mother, "Sky News" said: "Every minute the ambulance service brings in new victims.
cleaner water is a deficit.
“The small shops everywhere are crowded.”
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross rushes to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
"It is already a tragedy, but all this can worsen."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and told the military of the country: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was already this year shaken by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Now "Air Niugini"says that one of the people is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight, during which the plane landed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people is missing, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
The airline Air Niugini announced in a press release on Saturday afternoon that they could not answer for one of the passengers, a man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The locals helped rescue other passengers and crew by boat after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
The airline said that six people remained in hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
The causes of the crash and the sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the plane crashed into the lagoon shortly after taking off from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the length of the runway was overestimated on the plane.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and also the other passengers were able to get out of the sinking plane using the emergency exits, because the water was just up to the waist.
He said that the stewardess fell in panic and screamed, as well as that he had a slight head injury.
U.S. Navy sailors who worked nearby to improve the ship's berth also assisted in rescue operations using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) under water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airlines over the last twenty years, none of them are related to Air Niugini.
psycho psychoana analysis comment commenter for psycho psychoana analysis explains the course of events in the night in the night in which a woman was burned alive a woman was burned alive
An accusation on Saturday provided evidence in a retrial in which a man is accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
US Department of Forensic Science psychoanalytic commentator Paul Rowlet testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the information he got from the phone to put together how 29-year-old accused Quinton Telle and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers acted the night she died.
Rowlets said he had received location data from several phones, suggesting that Tel was with Chambers on the evening of her death, disputing his previous testimonies, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his phone was near Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
I don’t know if I’ll be able to do it again.
Sanford said he was lying "beca my car was Nashville" when the suspect asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford Sanford's car that night that night, Sanford Sanford said he "lie because my car was Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Telis said he only knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlets said that little by little after Chambers' death, Telis deleted text messages, calls and contacts from Chambers from his phone.
"He erased him from his life," said Hale.
I don’t know if I’m going to do it again.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed Band "The High Breed": Who is the intentional hip-hop?

The nanny in New York has sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received an erroneous text message from a mother who complained that the nanny "is black again."
The couple denies being racist, equating the trial with "extortion".
Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her rejection when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"IN NETHERLANDS, BACK THE BLACK," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent the message not to her husband, but to Maurice, and twice.
Disappointed by her clumsiness, Plasco-Flaxman discounted Maurice, stating that their previous babysitter, who was an African American, had done a bad job and that she was allegedly expecting a Filipino woman, referring to the New York Post.
Maurice paid for her one working day and sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice has sued the couple for compensation for their dismissal and wants to receive <0x24>350 a day for six months for a job with a secure living for which she initially applied, and without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things don't do," she said on Friday Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination discrimination."
The couple rejects the accusations that they are racist, arguing that Maurice’s employment break was a reasonable decision, because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She is not a racist.
"We are not racist," Jo Joel Plasco, husband, said "Post Post".
"But would you entrust your children to someone whom you have treated rudddly, even if it was only a mistake?

The predator "You really turn against someone in this way?

While the proceedings are still ongoing, public opinion quickly judges couples on social networks, disparaging them for their behavior and logical thinking.
a new letter reveals that Paddington book publishers were concerned that readers would not be able to associate a talking bear bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very amazing to learn now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "sweetly bitter" after her father's death last year, and that the book was "sweet" and "bitter" after the publication of the book.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she calls a "very important member of the family," her father quietly boasted of his eventual successes.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and was not bragging," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who achieves something: you're proud even if you didn't do it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Though it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always bestowed all merits to Paddington himself."

After landing, her daughter was taken with ambulances to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Ned called regularly and said it was very bad and that she was not expected to survive," said Ednana-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Ned, saying that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you very much, darling.
Hopeful I will soon be with thee.
Hopeful I will be with thee.
The drug that the doctors gave her to maintain her heartbeat slowly came to an end and left her body.
She would have died even sooner, and all this was now over.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not howl or scream, because I was in a situation where there were families and people around me.
Ich brauchte viel Kraft, mich zu beherrschen."
After all, then, already the daughter of the bereaved, Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
remedy "No one knew," she said.
"I stabbed my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
"I knew I knew how much he loved him."
mourning women mourning women attach cards to bridges to prevent suicide
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are acting to help others not to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey strengthen their cards at the Welsh Bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers so people can call and get support.
Tyler, Davis' son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydnia, said that her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognized him by a smile.
Everyone always always said that his smile "lit up" always and everywhere, always and everywhere."
However, he resigned his job before he died because he was "in a very, very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after Tyler committed suicide.
Davis Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it will have consequences."
Davis made the cards, "to let you know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Do sit not in silence; one must speak."
Humphrey, who has been Davis’ girlfriend for years, lost Mark, her mate, for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say he would feel sad or depressive or any quotes would feel," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude has changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning — when the children opened the presents he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
His death was a great trauma to children, but they had to deal with it: "It upsets the whole family.
This sets us apart.
Aber wir müssen alle weiter und kämpfen."

The future of Brett Caveno hangs in the air as the FBI opens an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he's asking for -- in terms of time and scope of the investigation -- we could probably get a little consensus," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission was "sharing" between the fortified guerrilla digging.
Why do Caveno and his Republic Republican supporters and Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their abstention is merely a coincidence.
The inter-elections are five weeks away, on November 6 — if, as expected, the Republicans go badly, then their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among themselves to the highest court.
George W. Bush calls senators lobbying them to support Caveno, who worked at the White House during Bush's time and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report? what happens after the FBI makes its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where currently 51 seats belong to the Republicans and 49 to the Democrats.
It is still not clear whether Caveno can win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide the vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Kim Kim Kim's leadership "red down" number of North Korea political asylum seekers number of North Korean political asylum seekers
The number of North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, South Korea's lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Unification Ministry of South Korea, said that last year there were 1127 political asylum seekers, compared to 2011 when their number was 2706.
Park said that tighter border controls star North Korea and China and high rates of human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are ultimately offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
The vast majority travel through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers political asylum seekers as illegal immigrants and deports them forcibly.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuklerization talks.
It happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Yongun in Singapore, when, in large trains, they agreed to cooperate in order to liberate the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions on the lack of progress in these talks.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our state, and under such circumstances, we will never be the first to unilaterally disarm the first," Ri Ri said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Caveno "hysterical" and claims he is unfit to work for the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the Chamber, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno "hysterical" and claimed that he was unfit to work for the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Caveno's testimony to the Senate Litigation Commission on Thursday.
Caveno emotionally denied accusations of sexual harassment to Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening argument, Caveno was very emotional, sometimes almost yelling and moaning, talking about his family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the Democrats on the Commission, citing the accusations against him of "grotesque and concerted destruction of a grotesque and concerted destruction of character" organised by liberals who are angry at Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes that Caveno’s testimony is grounds that he cannot work for the Supreme Court because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the attitude with which he addresses Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to question Caveno if approved and if the Democrats win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not suitable not only for the position in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the existing workplace in the court," Pelosi said.
Caveno, who is currently a judge at the Washington District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he is concerned about the possibility that Caveno makes decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Way, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Caveno bypassed the questions of whether he would reject the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"It is not a good time for a hysterical and duplicitous person to work in court, but one would expect us to happily say, "Isn't that wonderful?", said Pelosi.
But women have to hold themselves in the hands.
It is denunciation, for months and years everything has accumulated "over the edges", but she is not allowed to get all this out of herself by weeping.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinema told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She continued, "Once upon a time I was very helped by a woman who was the manager of a company, who said that she too was crying when she was angry, but created the technique -- when she got angry and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
Ich bin angry, ich bin angry.
And then she continued to go.
And I thought it was great."
tears are only partially recognized as a form of anger discharge, because they are misunderstood in the very foundations.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my oldest job, which had a high percentage of men, when I once wept because of an unmanifested anger, when an older woman, a reserved manager (woman), who I was always a little afraid of, took me to the stairwell, grabbed me at the back of my neck.
"Never let them see that you weep!" she told me.
"They don't know that you're overwhelmed.
They think that you are up in your sorrow, and will only rejoice that you have managed to crawl under the skin."
Patricia Schroeder, then a U.S. Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his pre-election campaign for the presidency.
In 1987, when Hart, caught in an extramarital relationship, left the ship, also known as "doing a fool" and quit the election, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she lamented and told me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the election and the last thing they wanted was for another to appear.
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
She was late in the campaign, she was behind the fundraiser and promised that she would not take part in the elections unless 2 million US dollars were collected.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that many of her supporters, who donated <0x24>1,000 to males, donated only <0x24>250 to her.
"Do they think that I get discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — thankful to the people who supported her, disappointed in the system, which made it very difficult to collect money and to address voters rather than delegates, and angry about sexism — where she was “drowned”.
"You'd think I'd have a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to him.
"You would think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She cried."
why the US-China China trade war can be beneficial for Beijing China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China
The main excuses about how the beginning of the trade war between the US and China is hidden and until the battle is over, disagreements between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, taxing the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting units worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), immediately imposing half of the goods exported to the US from China.
Beijing also "welcomely" responds every time, the latest is five to ten interest rates on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has announced that it undertakes to respond to the US one-to-one and is doubtful that in the near future, the world's second largest economy might tremble.
In order for Washington to step down, it would be necessary to agree to certain requirements, but it would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Xi Xi Jinping to bow down to the US in public.
But, experts say, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war may have a positive impact on China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries that are really more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a New American Security Researcher focused on Asia.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do it again.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country that has been plagued by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on land is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the territories destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
There are all conditions for refugees to voluntarily return to a country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and earning a living.
The UN assumes that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country and are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Almualem said the Syrian regime would accept aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he emphasized that the state will not accept conditional help or help from countries that helped sponsor the unrest.
the European golf team wins the Raiders Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raider Cup, beating the US national team with a score of 16,5:10,5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
“I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that, but I’m going to do it.”

Molinari played brilliantly in all his stages, becoming one of only four players ever to score 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament was played in its current format.
American Jordan Spit with 5 to 4 sensationally lost the European team, according to the rating, to the lowest player Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson lost 2 to 1 to Ian Polter of England, for whom this was probably the last Ryder Cup.
Serhio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a Spanish veteran of the eight Raider Cups, became the best player of all time from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"Usually I don't cry, but today I can't control the tears."
This was a difficult year.
From my heart I am grateful to Thomas that he distinguished me and believed in me.
I am very, very happy that we have recovered the cup.
It is the merit of the team and I am glad that I was able to help," Garcia commented emotionally after the victory of the European national team.
He then gives the name to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday won the U.S. golf legend Taigger Woods in 2 on 1 singles.
"The pride I feel when I win Tiger Woods, I grew up following that player," said the 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now he has a career record with 13-21-3 in the Raider Cup.
Unusual stats for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 top-level golf tournaments, second after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find their chances, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finn, who played high-profile golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, Jim Furick, captain of the U.S. national team, said: "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
“I don’t know if I’m going to do it, but I’m going to do it.”
We fought.
All Honour to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All his 12 players played a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and US Raider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to hit your hats.
"We won."
The latest news about the red tide: The concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota (Sarasota)
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Committee (FWC) indicates a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Gulf of Tampa.
According to the FWC, blooming spots have been reported in Pinnel, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier — indicating a decline in concentration.
The blooming of the red tide extends approximately 130 miles from North Pinelas to the coastline of the South Lee area.
The spots can be found about 10 miles from the coastal area of the Hillsborough area, but in some places they last about a week.
I don’t know if I’ll be able to do it again.
Medium concentrations in Pinela County or its offshore last week, low to high concentrations in Hillsborough Hillsboro, low to high concentrations in Manati count Manati, low to high concentrations in Sarasota or Sarasota, Charlotte, Lee or Collie, low to high concentrations and low concentrations.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation in the areas of Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
