28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco has been found dead in the stairwell of a supermarket.
But the victim's brother says that he can not imagine anyone who would harm his brother, pointing out that "His life finally began to improve."
The body, found outside a Westfield supermarket on Wednesday, was identified as Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, a spokesman for the San Francisco Bureau of Forensic Medicine said.
San Francisco police said his death was a homicide and an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, tells the San Francisco-based ABC KGO radio station that Frank had previously worked as a cook in Boston, but six months ago he had his dream job at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A representative of the restaurant Sons & Daughters informs that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
"We are a small team working as a cohesive family and we will miss him very much," he said.
During this difficult time, we are thinking along with Frank’s friends and family.
Louis Galicia says that Frank had spent the first night in a hostel, but recently his life had finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl," Louis tells the radio station KGO.
Luis Galicia says he doesn’t know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always pampered his family by preparing a delicious meal and preparing lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in disputes.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"Given everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond that shone brightly every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information phone number 415-575-4444.
Young doctors strike: calls for new protests
The representatives of the young doctors are asking their trade unions to start protests in a dispute over the new contract.
The Committee of Young Physicians of the British Medical Association (AMA) is going to ask the council to support wider protests in early September.
The JAK considers that the ministers have failed to dispel doubts about the agreement.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the AAL.
58% of all voting members voted against the Treaty.
In a tweet on Thursday evening, JAK council member Ellen McCort said the government remained silent on the issue and the deal was rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JAK vote resulted in a complete rejection of the agreement proposal and a decision to request new formal negotiations to discuss key issues."
In response to the government’s silence, the JAK today formally requested a meeting with the Council of the AAL to authorize the drafting of new agreements that would enter into force in September.
This is the first time in history that young doctors have taken part in six strikes, including the first time they have stopped working at the NHS.
After the vote rejecting the contract conditions proposed by the AAL and recommended by the BMA, Dr. Johan Malawana, a representative of the AAL Young Doctors, resigned.
Before meeting with 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt informed that the contract will be concluded with the English medics.
Russia and Turkey: The Alliance of Outcasts?
A gesture that put an end to the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the end of an eight-month war of name and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader in the St. Petersburg Castle, he had the impression that this partnership was more necessary for Ankara.
But they both shook their hands.
The smile of Vladimir Putin looked pretentious and did not cause warm emotions, even considering his usual restraint.
It’s not just a matter of how much you spend, but also how much you spend.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to the pre-crisis level, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm evokes conflicting feelings.
But the coolness radiating from Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the shooting down of a Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of pricking a dagger in the back of Moscow.
It was even more painful, given that it came from a friend's side.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, if not impossible.
Since November, Russia’s public opinion has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive insults against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame.
The most serious were the accusations that Erdogan’s own family profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied it.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting was that it was time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a sort of victory.
Ankara's benefits from peace are obvious.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup attempt last month.
His position has also been shaken by the countless terrorist attacks.
There are also economic motives.
Russia’s sanctions have caused massive damage, especially the charter ban, which usually provides for the influx of millions of Russian tourists into Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also breathe a sigh of relief when regular flights are resumed.
They are hoping for a holiday fever in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
As early as this week, the state TV predicts a drop in fruit and vegetable prices, as Turkish fruit and vegetable imports will resume.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
But the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what they see as a weak response to the coup attempt.
All of this can also be seen in the dissatisfaction with the protracted EU accession negotiations and Putin's intervention, who gladly exploits the situation that Turkey has alienated itself from the West.
Russia's leader undoubtedly scored points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because it has a deep-rooted fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, an "outcast alliance", two countries that feel alienated from the West, joining forces.
However, despite the public demonstration of unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
After more than three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The Turkish President purposefully avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find a common language on Syria.
But after months of openly hostile relations and a potential disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft, the situation has improved, as the two leaders have at least resumed talks.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to non-Scottish customers
The brand SKB will have a supporting role in the future, the bank’s CEO announced.
Outside Scotland, the SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevan tells the BBC in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank’s ambitions on a global scale.
It has given up on these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, brand strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, ranging from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided to bring other national brands to the forefront.
The Royal Scottish Banca will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the head office and the official stock exchange listing, will be renamed NatWest.
The brand The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private financial brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will now also gain attention.
Makevan was interviewed during a cruise with clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC’s Scottish channel: “SKB will become our brand of investors and our employees work with it because we are now more of a brand bank.”
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations and will involve various brands in sports sponsorship.
“The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?” says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and a focus on customer needs rather than our own, we’ve obviously made a big difference.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the time.
Frankie Detori wins 3,000th victory, taking first place in the New Market with a horse Predilection
Detectives uncork the champagne, winning their 3,000th victory twice in the first race at New Market.
On Friday, Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3000th victory in British history, taking first place in the New Market.
He achieved this by winning his second race in his hometown, with Predilection by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to score in a horse sprint.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Leicester Pigott, Pete Eddie and Willy Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who had previously won with a horse Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in New Market, because I have lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detori and Predilection are welcomed with applause and jubilation.
Two jockeys have reached this record in the race with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and 20-time champion Sir Antony McCoy, who has set several records in his career, winning more than 4,300 victories.
Lester Pigott, a nine-time derby winner, won 4,493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of our time, and it’s no surprise that he has achieved the success that few can achieve.
He is stylish and strong, but his sense of tactic distinguishes him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attracts fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago, at the Epsom, I told Frankie that he would have won 6,000 races if he hadn't just taken part in the weekend and the big race.
But to be serious, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been regularly winning the UK race for 30 years.
He is cheerful, which is great for the British race, and he is an excellent jockey.
Frank Detori marked this achievement with his trademark - the flying jump.
From finishing at wind speed to flying down, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been an adventurous journey.
He has won numerous major races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seven" in Ascot, and survived the plane crash and disqualification for drug use.
Three years ago, he found it difficult to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated the power of his character, challenging those who questioned him by returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for a while longer - Dettori has previously said that he would like to stay in the race until he is at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanov, the head of the administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired Sergei Ivanov, the head of the administration.
Ivanov has been in the circle of Putin's closest people for many years.
At the moment, the 63-year-old politician is appointed as the Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," without giving a reason.
Ivanov was replaced by Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012.
44-year-old Vaino is a former diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin’s website (in Russian), he later headed the President’s minutes and the administration of government employees.
After his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work as President of Latvia by drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Are smiles convincing?
This move has embarrassed Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is an old and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, once worked in the Soviet Security Service in the KGB.
In this position, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a hearing broadcast on state television, both men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles of the cameras, few are convinced by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a power struggle?
No one knows.
However, the official claim that the husband, who was considered to be a potential president, suddenly wanted to become the head of the environmental policy of Russia, is perceived with great skepticism.
In the comments published on the Kremlin website, Ivanov tells Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to entrust me with this difficult post, one might even say, problematic post, for four years.
It turns out that I have been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Former Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former KGB State Security Service employee, like Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the KGB, Ivanov took the position of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the post of president of Russia, because re-election of Putin for a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin became president - Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years returned to the presidency.
The appearance of puzzled fish in a garden in the city of Banff
A man from Banff asks for help in finding out the circumstances surrounding the appearance of a species of fish in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bane thinks that 75 of the fish could be sand eels that travelled by water.
Mr. Bane, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a fish video on Periscope, hoping that someone might know how these 5 centimetres large fish got into his garden.
Queensland Crossroads: The bridge is now connected to Fife.
Currently, the <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the intersection of Queensland and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The first of the four connecting parts has been completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The bridge is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 supporting cables.
Currently, the <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economics Secretary Kate Brown had arrived at the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge."
In this project, we see an unrivalled engineering solution, where only this part was built using more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last section connecting the bridge to Rosita will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, director of the fourth bridge connection project, says: “The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge.”
In this fantastic project, the first compound demonstrates high-end engineering construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the support of the north tower, it remained to us to connect the northern section of the road with the part of the land or viaduct.
This was done by shifting the part of the viaduct of the northern access road 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Huge, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled sloping by about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions, with which the team worked, was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Simona Bails wins gold in gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the fuss.
Simon Bails doesn't care.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortlessly performs the exercises on the log.
Unbeatable on the floor.
Absolutely perfect.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was superior to that of silver medal winner and her teammate Alija Raismane and bronze medal winner Alija Mustafina from Russia.
If you’re looking for a job in the United States, you’ll want to find a job in the U.S., and you’ll need a job in the U.S., and you’ll need to be able to work in the U.S., including your home.
Bails became the fourth American in a row to win the title of multi-race champion and the fifth best gymnast, gradually consolidating her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and possibly the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears, for the long road to this moment was over.
This achievement puts him next to such unsurpassed athletes as Michael Phelps, who took his sport to another level.
Bails has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the World Championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such brilliant, accurate, and ambitious combinations of exercises that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lu Reton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
In Brazil, she faced a final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with the expectations placed on her and not with the rest of the athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas, without a gold medal.
If you’re looking for a job in the United States, you’ll want to find a job in the U.S., but you’re not going to find a job in the U.S., and you’re not going to find a job in the U.S., you’re going to find a job in the U.S., and you’re going to be in the U.S. for a while.
The first gold medal was won by Bails on Tuesday, making a special farewell party for team coordinator Marta Karolji.
Although Bails says that she had not expected anything like that on her long journey to the top of fame, it is not true.
Part of her performance in the free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music that would fit perfectly into the street next to the Rio Olympics arena.
It's no coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents when she was an infant, and discovered by coach Amy Burman’s mother on a tour of the gym where she had her leggings, has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost a multi-race since the summer of 2013 and the series of victories can continue as long as Bails wants.
Although Mustafin was a little in the lead during the two rotations, it was only an illusion.
The balance log and free movement - part of the competition, where Bails will defend his champion title, is still ahead.
She took the lead with a score of 15,433 on the log and strengthened the leadership with a score of 15,933 in free movement
Raismane gently embraced her while they waited for the results, which were only a formality and she burst into tears of joy when the dream she had once recorded in her notebook came true.
Raismane's result was a small revenge for four-year-old events, when she shared the third place with Mustafin, but lost the fight for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "grandmother", took a convincing lead.
After performance in the free movement, which allayed doubts about her return, she could devote herself to the crowd of air kisses.
In the meantime, 19-year-old Bails’ viral Twitter post r, which she posted this week, has a completely different meaning.
6-year-old Mahay Brown survives a firing squad in Philadelphia.
Police said the six-year-old was shot dead in Philadelphia, saying he was the second six-year-old to be shot dead in Philadelphia this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahay Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells television: "His little body was simply bullet-tightened."
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in hospital and has already undergone several surgeries.
The family informs that he will definitely recover.
He had to start first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people who were shot in the city of Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
The CBS Philadelphia channel reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in a critical condition, while the other two victims are in a stable condition.
The channel said the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of them were attackers.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were likely involved in the shooting.
In the event of an accident, the shells of the gun’s cartridges belonging to various weapons were found.
It looks like it's been a long time shooting.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
“It looks like there were several armed shooters who were actively involved in the shooting,” says Philadelphia Police Captain Antony Ginaldi.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
No one has yet been arrested and police are reported to be checking surveillance camera records.
On Tuesday, a shotgun hit a 6-year-old girl while she was playing in front of her house in the Westbrook district.
She is recovering, but the police are still looking for the perpetrator.
Why do we need Simona, Gabija and Lauria?
I call it the Women's Olympic Athletics Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
First of all, I've been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team consists of three track and field athletes, Simona Bails, Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who inspire many young girls.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alija Raismane, who is Jewish, and Madison Kociana, who is Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast has been an American of African descent.
Last year, Simona and Gabija took the 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
At previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprisingly became the Olympic champion, and America could rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by triple world champions Simone Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal in the women's singles competition.
Her teammate Alija Raismane won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but in the rest of the country, the situation during gymnastics lessons is completely different.
Simona, Gabija and Lauria entered the Olympic team, as did Alija and Madison.
They are "Olympic Five", because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Marta Carola's work as a coach.
In fact, gymnastics is an expensive sport. Gymnasts mostly train in private athletics clubs and are supported by parents who pay for training, rooms, travel, uniforms, hotels (coachs, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletics clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes spend all their workouts, and this is an expensive and long-term investment for families of athletes.
Amy Burman - Simone Bails coach and Maggie Hayney - Laurie Hernandez coach has been training their athletes since both girls began to practice athletics.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by Simona, Gabija and Lauria with cheaper gymnastic training opportunities.
I founded my athletics organization 20 years ago.
My organization is based in Haarlem and we offer more than 15,000 gymnastic exercises for young people (mostly black and Spanish) in the city for free or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local youth with the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and aspiration.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it is fantastic.
Doing this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Alija, Gabija and Madison for the excellent demonstration of "Girls Power", winning the Olympic gold medals and motivating countless young girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, the new doctors plan to go on strike.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to amend the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to enter into a contract, pointing out that the NHS is in a fragile state and further delays will only harm employees and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in the conditions for working at night shifts and on weekends, in order to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Last night, Dr. Elena Makourta, a representative of BMA’s new doctors, announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the labor crisis and it does not provide equal conditions for all doctors.
Eight weeks until the first group of new doctors will sign the new contract, so progress must be made, because there is not much time left.
The BMA's attempts to resolve the problem through negotiations have been met with unwillingness on the part of the government and sometimes complete silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month, Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremiah Hunt must take immediate action, stop inaction and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he does not do this, then the young doctors are ready for new protest actions.
During the last strike at the end of April, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, while nurses and counsellors tried to replace the doctors who had gone to picket.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to raise the rate for working weekends for 54,000 new doctors who would be covered by the new contracts.
NHS Chief Employment Officer Daniel Mortimer urged young doctors not to go into streaks.
Mr Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on busy workers and cause anxiety, stress and obstruction to patients, carers and their families.
In the last two months, we have spoken to the new committee of doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, have responded positively to their questions about the lenders and whistleblowers.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues such as staff placement, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programs, drop-out of studies and gender pay gaps in medicine - shows that employers, England health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are serious about implementing the agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
The drug can reduce the risk of a heart attack by about 2 pounds per day.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with the drug for 2 pounds a day as official representatives recommend using it for more people and for a longer period of time.
Anti-coagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a repeated heart attack.
NICE, a member of the NHS, recommends the use of this drug for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of a heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE currently recommends the use of the drug 4 years after a heart attack in order to further reduce the cardiovascular risk.
Every year, about 140,000 people in England suffer a heart attack, and a quarter of them suffer a recurrent heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the build-up of fat in the walls of the heart causing blockages.
If the blockage breaks, it can cause a blood clot, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if a blood clot separates from the blood vessel wall, it can travel further into the bloodstream and block the blood’s access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at higher risk of having a repeated heart attack.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots forming.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and 60 mg twice a day with aspirin for another 3 years.
NICE Health Technology Director Professor Carol Longson explains: “Despite the availability of medication to prevent a recurrent heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, often with severe consequences.”
Fear of a repeated heart attack can have a negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
The evidence suggests that the combination of Ticagrelor with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attack and heart attack in people who have experienced it before.
Preliminaryly recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are happy that we can expand the treatment options for thousands of people who are thus benefiting.
In view of the limited efficacy and safety information on Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding beyond 3 years, the draft guideline does not recommend its use beyond this period.
The culture of political correctness promotes election fraud in Muslim communities
According to a management report, former Mayor of Towerhamlet, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed for corruption.
The government report reveals that the culture of political correctness is turning a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickle criticizes police, election monitors and city councils for ignoring signs of electoral fraud because they are "afraid to harass ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of an anti-corruption organisation, says that intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to deploy guards at electoral stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should present an identity document when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters only have to give their name and address.
He even recommends that the fingers of voters be marked with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Whistleblowers must also be given more protection, says Sir Erik.
He believed that the press should have more access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says, “The goal is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it.”
The report was commissioned by Downing Street after the scandal surrounding the Towerhamlet City Elections.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided to dismiss the mayor of the city, Lutfur Rahman, from his post due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious views of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman ran his election campaign with the premise that Muslim believers have a religious obligation to vote for him."
About 300 votes were false or questionable, as one person had voted several times.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
He said it was particularly alarming to vote by mail where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eric suggested a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document to establish the identity of the person.
His report states: "Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for candidates selected by community elders, especially in Bangladesh and Pakistani communities."
"There is concern that the regional authorities do not pay attention to these problems because of political correctness, because ethnic and religious interests could be affected."
Sir Erik set out 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, including a ban on political activists from using postal votes to prevent "voting collection".
The report, which is being examined by Theresa May, also calls for a more thorough check of registrations in order to prevent the use of electoral rolls for fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider requiring voters to present an identity document before voting.
Mark the fingers of voters with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematic verification of the nationality of persons to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibit political campaign participants and activists from working with votes given by post and ballot envelopes for voting by post.
Ensure the police have the power to assign guards to polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for intimidation under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Prohibit photographs in polling stations.
Requirement to use only English at polling stations (except in Wales).
Step up training to ensure that polling station staff go to the polling station one at a time.
Sir Eric sharply criticises the Metropolitan Police, expressing his incomprehension that there is no charge in the Towerhamlet case.
He says: “The election court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for activities related to corruption and fraud.”
He was convincingly found guilty according to the standard of criminal evidence based on conclusive evidence.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
Sir <0xC4><0x92>riks points out: "Last year's court decision is a wake-up call.
Our country is known as the birthplace of parliament, but the alarming and covert proliferation of electoral fraud and the pretence of the authorities that fraud does not occur jeopardises this good reputation.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have to make.

A CBC Olympic commentator apologises for his comment that the Chinese swimmer was “dead like a pig”.
Byron McDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanha's finish in fourth place in the 4x200 m freestyle relay for women caused a storm of indignation in CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologise after one of its commentators commented that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "left the race to sniff out alone" and died like a pig.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when the 4x200 m women's freestyle relay set out his personal opinion at the end of the final.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC commentators' team to give the comments a boost, said: "That little 14-year-old from China can't keep up with it."
"Too intrusive, she flew out of the race that stinked and died like a pig."
Thank you very much.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana scored 1:57.79 in the second stage, which is 1.61 seconds slower than that of Canadian Taylor Rucka, allowing Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers all over Canada immediately reacted on the Internet, as they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emmett McFarlain tweeted: “Did a direct CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “died like a pig”????”.
The idiot did not understand that they were still on live air.
Ai Yanha from China in the 4x200m freestyle final was named "the little fourteen-year-old from China who doesn't keep up."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly took hold, as many demanded explanations.
Twitter users couldn’t believe Byron McDonald’s insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sara Paradi wrote: "Wow, <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and for you we all sound like racists.
Shortly after, Scott Russell, who was leading the CBC live broadcast at the time, apologised for McDonald's comments, saying, "We're sorry that the comment about the swimming result came live."
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
The CBC apologised to more than 90 people who had responded on Twitter to the comment.
McCdonald's colleague, Scott Russell, had to apologise in his place.
CBC then copied an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comment.
Also, the channel quickly published an apology and a statement.
We very much regret that such comments have been made and they have been broadcast live.
Yesterday we immediately responded and apologized to all the live viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were made about the performance of the swimmer, and not addressed to her personally.
But in any case, these were unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen statements, and Byron is very sorry about what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologised live and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
On the CBC Olympic live stream, he said: "I would like to take a moment and apologise for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle race."
I am talking about the performance of the swimmer, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I did not intend to show disrespect and I am really sorry that this happened.
Primark customers are shocked by a woman who shamelessly tries on lingerie in the middle of the store.
Buyers felt embarrassed when the woman began to undress to try on panties in the middle of the store.
To make matters worse, she tried them to make sure they fit her and then took them off, putting the panties back on the shelf.
She continued to search for clothing at the Folkestone Bouverie Place Mall and tried on four more panties.
Primark shop in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone – the place where this woman tried on her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At that time, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, was also in the store, telling her that the unfamiliar woman, after trying on her lingerie, put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She says people couldn’t believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the shop, she took her underpants from the shelf, took off her tights and trousers, and measured them on the spot.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just tried them on the spot.
Everyone was watching her take off her panties, and apparently she didn’t like them because she just put them back on the shelf.
She put on three more panties until she decided that she didn’t like any of them and left the store.
It didn’t seem to bother her, that someone was watching or thinking about the person who would buy the clothes she was wearing.
Ms. Davidson, 33, from Kent says, "It's likely that someone will buy clothes that have been tried by another person and that haven't been washed afterwards."
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson adds: "I presume that the store staff took those clothes off the shelves after she left - which is also acceptable."
I can’t imagine buying new underwear and finding out that another woman tried on them and then didn’t wash them.
A spokesman for Primark stated that Primark was aware of the incident which took place on Tuesday 9 August.
The specific clothes are removed from the shelves of the store.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
In order to find out how to protect ourselves in a short distance from the attackers with a firearm, we talked to the Krav Maga Grandmaster from New York Ron Mizrake.
Whether you’re attacked from the front or the back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and win over the attacker.
Mizraki indicates that if an attacker attacks from behind, then you first need to turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
The weapon must then be grasped between the front arm and the shoulder and hit the opponent's face with his free elbow.
Then follow a kick with the knee along the groin and while the attacker freezes in pain, take away his weapon, hit his face with the arm of the weapon and step back, continuing to draw the weapon against him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - avoid the trajectory of the shot, grasp the weapon and fold it so that the villain can not fire.
At the same time, press on the weapon and hit the opponent on the chest and finally take away the weapon and retreat while continuing to aim at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, it's safer to give the robber your money.
The Vandal family destroys Saltash Cornwall’s social home and is thrown out onto the street.
The Vandal family has been evicted for terrorizing neighbours, causing <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 worth of damage to a social home.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock have been removed from the property in Salta, Cornwall, as they have been the subject of several complaints.
When they were forcibly evicted from their property, shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property had been completely destroyed.
There were holes in the floors and walls, garbage was scattered everywhere, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family is now evicted from the property and most likely lives on a private property.
Donna McKay, a Cornish Housing Authority manager, says there are concerns that it will not be possible to renovate housing.
She says that the people living here have been extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live like that.
In this case, a number of factors have to be considered, as this property will not be of good repute in Cornwall in the future.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who had stayed on the property periodically, and the police said that their terror was in violence, breaking out on the street with baseball bats, intimidating the local population, using drugs, selling drugs, and loud screaming and blasphemy.
It’s not just a matter of how much time you spend with your kids.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
In the house, where drugs may have been traded before, several floor boards have also been pulled out.
Neighbours say that they regularly clashed on the street and were constantly called the police.
The Cornish Housing Service forced them out of the property after giving them 11 weeks to get out of the house voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy about the eviction, because their life was an absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about the other inhabitants."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
It's unbelievable how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's going to be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the Head of Neighbourhood Protection at Cornwall Housing Service, said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly called the police.
In the overgrown garden of the house, various old and unusable items were found.
He also said: "It is a pity that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, because eviction from the house is always the last step considered by the Cornish Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case, because their behaviour was extreme and it was very hard for the neighbours to watch their behaviour.
I appreciated the work of my entire team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the community, who were courageous and cooperated with us in providing us with the information we needed.
I hope that this event will make life easier for neighbours and show that antisocial behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived here at different times, but they were all about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after placement.
Service workers will now have to clean up a heap of rubbish left in the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, scales, accessories and 1,700 pounds of cash.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the eviction, it became known that they are currently renting a private property in Plymouth.
Many walls of the house were marked with graffiti.
Police say they will continue to evict tenants who are violating their rental contracts.
Devon and Cornwall police spokeswoman Angela Crow said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
She also said: "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they please and that it will have no consequences."
The Devon and Crownwall police do not accept criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
A willingness to spend can give a boost to the economy.

The Mayor of Cannes has banned burkini swimsuits on beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort city of Cannes has banned the wearing of burkini swimsuits on the beaches of the city, which almost completely cover the body of a woman and very much resemble a wetsuit, local authorities said Thursday.
The Mayor of Cannes, David Linar, has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone who does not wear swimwear, who respects good customs and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"The beach dress, which shows the appearance of religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the targets of terrorist attacks, may present a risk of disturbances of public order (clashes, clashes, etc.) which must be prevented," the order said.
“We’re not talking about banning religious symbols on the beach, but about outward-looking clothing that is associated with trust in terrorist movements that are at war with us,” explained Thierry Miguls, head of municipal utilities.
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market, which will take place in the coming months.
This week, a water park in the city of Marseille cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women in burkini swimsuits, as politicians from both the right and left expressed outrage over the event.
In France, the wearing of face-covering Muslim women's headscarves is prohibited, but religious symbols or appropriate clothing are not.
On July 14, 85 people were killed in a terror attack in Nice, a resort town near Cannes, claimed by the Islamic State group.
On July 26, two attackers who had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State brutally murdered a priest in a church in northwestern France.

Also this year, like other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
It is recommended to leave the profit earned last year undivided.

The festival "Cuban" has begun on Lucavsala.
In the evening of Thursday, 11 August, Lucavsala was given the start of one of the last festivals of this summer - there will take place "Cuban" until Sunday night.
The first evening was pampered by such bands as Enter Shikari from Great Britain, which was expected last year, but the program disappeared unnoticed, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the band "The Prodigy" and others.
In the following days of the festival, the program also includes noteworthy names - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", punk legend "Ramones" drummer Marky Ramon with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg" other program of the event, "Brutto&Lyapis" with Belarusian punk leader Sergei Mihalok, popular punk rocker "Vylangi" and the popular Georgian actor.
This is the second year that the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered financial failure and huge losses, but it did not prevent the organizers from re-trying - they added a spirit sign to the name, included in the program also a Latvian group (on Friday evening at 19:15 on the stage will climb "All Day Long") and announced that now the festival has become "closer and has acquired the local coloring alongside such Riga symbols as its panorama and cats".

The President, who remained in the shadows: Gustav Zemgale - 145.
On Friday, 12 August, the 145th anniversary of the birth of the second President of Latvia, Gustavs Zemgals, is celebrated.
Zemgals proclaimed the state of Latvia, but was undeservedly left in the shadow of the widely described first President of Latvia J<0xC4><0x81>nis <0xC4><0x8C>akste and the last President of the pre-war period K<0xC4><0x81>rlis Ulmanis.
No one in our country has defended democracy and the rule of law so much as Zemgals, writes Arnolds Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> in his book dedicated to Gustavs Zemgals published ten years ago.
In a conversation with the portal "Delfi", Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the few high-ranking politicians who has had a sense of humor.
The rest of the stiff, always very right.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have, but also how much you spend.
“He was one who was close to the people,” says Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
Modern politicians know little about history, they refer to Karlis Ulmanis as a good leader, but rarely does anyone know how furious he was.
The only person he hasn’t shouted at in government meetings was General Balodis.
Even if he is kind and smiling in the pictures, he was naturally hysterical.
"Zemgals with his sense of humor and democracy makes exactly the opposite impression," says Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
In addition to the above, we may also share your personal information with third parties, such as advertisers and advertisers, to help us improve our services and to provide you with more relevant information.
He also notes that Zemgals has stood out with respect to minorities and regularly invited Jewish representatives to the Presidential Palace.
"At that time, it was not a common practice, after the Zemgale Presidency Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and balanced man who had to be persuaded to become president for a long time.
He did not seek it himself, just did not hunger for fame.
He was also quite critical of himself, because he did not know French, but he believed that the president should be able to do so.
"During the presidency, the basics of the French language were learned," explains Stranga.
Zemgals did not allow himself to be persuaded to run for office again, he did not like the high positions at all.
In any case, he is a very respectable person in the history of Latvia, already before entering the presidential palace he was in a serious position - he was a highly demanded notary.
In addition, Zemgals headed the famous Zemgale treasury at 3 Suvorova Street, where the Association of Collectors and Creditors was located, where practically the Latvian state was formed in government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
It was not a big fan of Ulmanis, but he did not object in public either.
“In private conversations, however, he has sometimes said that he does not really sympathize with Ulmanis’ actions,” says Stranga.
He lived a peaceful life, there was no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How do you remember Zemgale nowadays?
It is a pity, but for a large part he associates only with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his views were central.
"There were no major upheavals during his time, that is to say, he could associate himself with such a truly stable presidency," says Stranga.
During the presidency of Gustavs Zemgals, from 1927 to 1930, a Latvian state visit to Sweden was also held, which at that time meant for Latvia, implicitly, full recognition in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the family of democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgals arrived on a state visit to Stockholm.
The visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child cope with anger attacks.
I often have to face the fact that the appearance of anger, anger in a child is perceived by parents as something wrong and abnormal.
When the child openly shows his anger - we do not know how to react, "Econet" indicates psychologist Ekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these so natural and human feelings - anger and anger, which everyone experiences periodically.
Aggression - it is already a physical action directed against another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, excited - usually we know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger in ourselves: express, suppress, hide, keep in ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other relatives, we can kick the sofa in anger, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to dispel anger!), take a shower, hit the table with a bullet, and do other things that we do not usually do.
We do not target our aggression against others, because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
Children do not understand what happens to them when they get angry, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!", "You're a fool", "Bad Mom", "I don't hate you", "I won't be friends with you" - and very rarely when you can say, "I'm mad at you."
Children live in the literal sense, they are completely here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and sincere in the manifestation of their feelings, and are often also held captive by various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid the child to show feelings, including anger, not to be ashamed of it and naughty, but on the contrary - to help the child.
Do we need a pause in the relationship?
A long working day in which everything has not gone as you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to "disconnect" from the whole world for a moment, a day or even longer.
Is it possible to pause for a moment and breathe a little?
Or does it show that each of the partners has their own path to follow?
It’s the same with the rest of the world.
John (23) is short and concise: "For me, if a relationship requires a pause, then do not be with the right person."
In the meantime, Eduards (30) has discovered a scheme that could possibly help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to fall on your nerves for every little detail, then definitely - this is the right time to look at other hunting fields to see if you miss him, or if you don't think about him or don't even want to see him anymore.
So the answer is yes, taking a pause can help you save time and understand how important the other half is to you.
I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do that.
In my opinion, relationships should take a break from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail of what the other person is doing, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People are starting to bother each other, especially when there is nothing to talk about but what you have done during the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven’t had a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think for a moment that somewhere else or next to another is better, then why does this woman, with whom you are together, deserve one who can think that this is not good enough and behind the mountains there are paradise fields?
Thinking is a little betrayal.
If not, then not.
"I have, so a little condemn those who do not." says Edmunds (46).
This is the first time I’ve been to the United States.
I think everyone needs a moment to take a break.
You can’t look each other in the eye every moment of the day, all the time, from morning till evening, and rejoice in the everlasting love.
Wake up!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, a friend or a wife, but if both of them are able to maintain the balance between family life and the rest of the world, then they can live up to the edge of the grave.
That's it, that's it.
It is difficult to say whether or not it is necessary, whether or not it is possible to take a pause, but one thing is clear: the person who initiates it does not have something in the relationship to the end, something is missing.
If this question is heard, then one should expect that in the near future there will be some changes - for the better or for the worse, it depends on themselves.
I think, while you are still young and crazy, while you need to pause - at least all the time, but when everything becomes serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, then there can be no question of rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
"If you can't stand each other's society right now and need a break from time to time, then what will happen when you are pensioners who comment on how passing cats are moaning or quarrel about which day the garden should be weeded better", explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the masters have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls was the first to arouse the interest of the Latvian people in performing arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain forever unforgettable," Romans Suta wrote about the old master of Latvian painting J<0xC4><0x81>nis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls.
In 2016, with the opening of the old master’s extensive retrospective exhibition in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but it is open to visitors from 13 August and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art honours painter Jan Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls (1866-1916), whose one hundred and fiftyth birthday is internationally included in the UNESCO calendar of holidays, with a wide retrospective at the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall.
The retrospective exhibition, which features more than 150 works, is one of the central events of Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls’ anniversary programme.
The selection of works of art is mostly made up of the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic’s creative activity, stylistic variability and variety of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from Akseli Gallena-Kallela Museum, Literature and Music Museum, Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Museum, Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The atmosphere of the turn of the century is enlivened by the presence of photographs, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the connection between individual works of art and the photographs taken by the painter himself with his camera for his creative work.
The Finnish-Latvian Commonwealth Society "Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls-seura", named after a Latvian classic, at the same time offers a small informative travelling exhibition "With a Look in Finland, with a Heart in Latvia" at the Latvian National Museum of Art.
A similar exposition in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened at the "Virka" gallery in Helsinki in the autumn.

“If it does, it will be announced by the BBC,” Leblanc said in a conversation with television critics.
In July, Leblanc’s partner Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that Leblanc and Gas in the Floor! are "like made for each other".
Evans describes the former star of Friends as a "real and good man", thus dispelling the rumours that the friendship between the two had broken during filming.

It is expected that the meldonium contained in the medicine Mildronate manufactured in Latvia could be removed from the list of banned substances for athletes already this year, said Ivars Kalvins, the director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, academician, on Friday morning in the LNT broadcast for 900 seconds.
He said he would travel to Canada in September to discuss the issue of meldonium with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed the hope that Mildronate will be removed from the "black list" already this year.

In his interpretation, the business behind the scenes of the US models has acquired the perverted grace of a sophisticated photo shoot and the intolerance of a horror film.
Basically - a very provocative, balancing work of sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which the lines between the European art house films and the territory of the Hollywood genre product are difficult to draw.
The film with Vigo Mortensen in its main role emphasizes the question whether the parents’ conceptually chosen life models (ecological, vegetarian, alternative and detached from the gluttony and values of consumer society) bring blessing or destructiveness to their children.
The father of six children, an idealist, after the death of his wife, is confronted with questions about the correctness of choices and true values.

“We didn’t shoot them because they took civilians with them on their way to Jer<0xC4><0x81>bulus,” a spokesman for the Kurdish military council said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, said Friday that Menbi<0xC5><0x9F> had been freed from jihadists.
The Islamic state of Menbij was occupied in 2014.
QSD expelled most of the Islamic State fighters from Menbij last week, but some persisted and showed fierce resistance.
However, on Friday they left the city, taking with them the prisoners.
Islamists go to Jer<0xC4><0x81>bulus, which is located on the border with Turkey.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based group of Syrian activists, also reported that the Islamic State kidnapped some 2,000 people.
The Observatory reported that Islamists had hijacked the cars of city residents, forced people to climb on them, and then took them to Jer<0xC4><0x81>bulus.
The Islamic State militants have also carried out mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamists kidnapped more than 400 civilians, including women and children, during the conquest of Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria.
Later, Islamists freed about 270 of the prisoners.
It is not known how many Islamic State fighters fled Menbij.
A spokesperson for the Kurdish Menbij Military Council said the QSD had rescued 2,500 people held hostage by Islamists in Menbij.

The Freeport of Riga has implemented all the recommendations of the State Audit Office regarding the Krievu Island project.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office (SAO) regarding the implementation of the project Infrastructure Development on Krievu Island for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned for the next board meeting of the Freeport of Riga.
In order for the recommendations to be implemented in accordance with the opinion of the State Audit Office, the Freeport of Riga Authority was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte at the Freeport of Riga Authority and the recommendations made for the improvement of project management at the subsequent stage of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SAO today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport of Riga Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the State Audit Office on the usefulness of the implementation of the Krievu Island project, we are very responsible towards the implementation of the project and the provider of funding - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasize that all the construction works planned within the project have been fully completed within the set deadlines and in the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the SAO and also the stevedores that the main goal of the Freeport of Riga is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the SAO regarding the project management and supervision issues," said Sanita Kaire, Project Manager of Krievu Island.
To control and monitor the achievement of the project objective, the existing long-term action plan was supplemented with the most important planned activities of the involved parties and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, monitoring tools for the planned construction process, as well as definitions of the most important border points.
The approved action plan to achieve the project objective by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the SAO, is supplemented with performance monitoring activities, thus reinforcing the control of the time limits of the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project from the Freeport of Riga.
In order to improve project management and reduce potential risks, a project management plan has been developed, defining the areas of project management and indicating the documents developed, which provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
In order to increase the capacity of the project, a project management organisational chart has been developed, which reflects the planned project management team structure, staff qualifications and functions.
In order to improve the communication of the Freeport of Riga Authority with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of the parties involved in the project has been developed, which, in addition to the parties specified in the project action plan, defines the parties concerned for the successful completion of the project, the principles, types and periodicity of information exchange.
In order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the necessity of entering into a service contract or launching a procurement and the rule of law will have to be substantiated in more detail in the future.
Within the framework of the project, the port infrastructure of Krievu Island has been built in accordance with the world standards - four new deep-water berths, railway connections, as well as engineering communications.
The buildings co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation already at the end of last year, achieving savings of EUR 10.6 million.
Security at airports in Slovakia has been stepped up due to threats.
It’s not just a matter of how much time you spend with your kids.
"Given the threat, we have stepped up security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ice," a spokesman for the Slovak interior ministry told AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Center is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
The European Union (EU) will hold an informal summit on 16 September in the capital of Slovakia, with the exception of the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of Britain's Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia holds the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers discuss the number of "victims of the Berlin Wall".
According to a new study, the death toll on the former communist border of East Germany may be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims remain.
According to data released Wednesday by the Berlin Wall museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, 1,841 people were murdered by communist authorities along the border with Western Allied zones and later West Germany as they tried to escape from their territory.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and from time to time adjusts the number of victims.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including a six-year-old boy who drowned as his family tried to get to West Germany through then-Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also the defectors of the Soviet army.
"The final extent of the damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," the museum's director, Alexander Hildebrandt, said in a statement.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape the communist-controlled state are maintained and do not disappear," Hildebrandt said in a statement.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The number 1841 is unconvincing," said Jochen Statet, an expert in East German history at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing suspected deaths at the border and have so far only confirmed 260.
Previously, researchers estimated that 138 people were murdered by communists at the Berlin Wall alone.
If we take into account the number of people who died trying to escape through the Baltic Sea or to reach the West through the territory of the neighbouring countries, the number of victims could, according to the State, reach about a thousand.
However, it is still significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all the suicides of East German border guards, regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not related to direct violence.
“If seniors aged 70 to 80 died of a heart attack after contracting border control,” said Hildebrandt.
However, State is convinced that a distinction needs to be made between the elderly, who may have died as a result of their treatment, and those who died as a result of prolonged waiting in hot weather on a bus at the border.
It is not easy, however, because the communist authorities in East Germany did not compile such statistics, and researchers have to examine the documents in various dispersed archives, the State said.
However, the State Group has recently received new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
The President of the LPF, Mr. Pone, went to Rio with a coach’s accreditation; for himself, this is a surprise.

"However, apparently for objective reasons he was not," said Mr. Pong, expressing the opinion that this did not affect the result of Ribakov.
At the request of the federation, Uvja’s coach took on the task of helping her.
It is important to note that this is not the first time that a person has been diagnosed with the disease.
In my opinion, it is unethical to approve five persons in the LOC Executive Committee and not to remove one of them.
"I don't know why the swimming federation didn't have enough space," Mr Pone said that the society did not appreciate the work of the federation and their presidents, recalling that the presidents of the federations do not receive salaries.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 30a to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the application of this Regulation.

“I was nominated as a team leader, but for unknown reasons I got a coach’s accreditation and now I can’t get in anywhere.”
The situation changed every day, the number of available accreditations changed.
Until the last moment, I thought that Germans would be there, because I did not have any other information.
According to the information available to the agency LETA, a couple of days before the start of Ribakova, she had a face-to-face conversation with Pony and after that the swimmer had tears in her eyes, however, the LPF president himself said that it was a daily conversation with the desire to tune in athletes before the start.
If you’re looking for a new job, then you’re looking for a new job.
The President of the Federation said that drowning issues were also very important in Latvia, and he also spoke about such programs while in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.

This week, during the Latvenergo AS fish resource recovery programme, the introduction of salmon and sea trout juveniles is taking place in the Daugava near Manga<0xC4><0xBC>sala, and this year it is planned to introduce more than 600,000 annual salmon and sea trout juveniles grown in the fish farms of the scientific institutes Bior Tomes and Dole.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 30a to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the application of this Regulation.
In spring and early summer 2016 pike and lamprey larvae will be released, in June - whitefish, in July - single-summer salmon, in August and September - pikeperch and vimba.
M<0xC4><0x81>ris Ku<0xC5><0x86>ickis, Latvenergo Production Director, said that environmental care is one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of Latvenergo Group.
"In the measures for the protection and reproduction of fish resources, each activity is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both in the rearing and placing of juvenile fish in the Daugava basin, and in the implementation of other activities," said Ku<0xC5><0x86>ickis.
This year, more than 600,000 annual salmon and sea trout juveniles will be released into the estuary of the Daugava River.
For the second year in a row, fry are tagged by cutting off the fat.
The cargo brought today contains 25,000 salmon pups with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, in a scientifically justified species composition and number in Daugava and its basin water bodies, the introduction of fish fry and larvae takes place.
In accordance with the regulatory enactments, the reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava River and its basin water bodies shall be carried out by Bior, based on the expert-examination of the losses caused to fish resources as a result of Latvenergo economic activity and providing a conclusion on what compensation measures should be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
In turn, the State Environmental Service, on the basis of the referred to expert-examination, shall take a decision on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual compensation amount of Latvenergo is EUR 1 035 000 in the fish resource recovery programme.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo in cooperation with the association "M<0xC4><0x93>s zivis" for the fifth year placed 400 artificial fish spawning nest in the Daugava near Kaibala and Ik<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0xB7>ile.
Cooperation with the association, promoting natural spawning of fish, is an initiative additionally supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the fish resource recovery programme.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in the reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava River.
The festival "Sansus<0xC4><0xAB> koncertz<0xC4><0x81>le" has a rural courtyard, forest, felling.
Sleep in a tent, eat like in a restaurant, walk in sneakers and listen to exquisite chamber music, enjoying the quiet tranquility of nature - such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sansusi, which invites you to Akn<0xC4><0xAB>ste municipality for the third summer.
The festival will take place in the yard of the former parish house of Sus<0xC4><0x93>ja - a village that no longer exists, next to forests and fellings.
In three days - from 12 to 14 August - on five stages you can combine carefree enjoyment of nature and academic music.
Here theater and contemporary circus, performances and installations meet with music.
Opera and academic music, especially in their latest forms, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the stiffness of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but only a few minutes to smile on your face and lightness on your feet.
"Please do not look for the program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the true taste of Sansusis can only be captured by spending all three days there," invites the initiator and host of the festival, opera baritone Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
We open the gates of the festival on Friday at 17.00, and the first concert is at 19.00.
Of course, there will be apps on the site with all the information.
For those who need to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated - from 9.00 a.m. until the next dawn.
"The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", tells Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
The beautiful bouquet of artists includes, for example, violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Krist<0xC4><0xAB>ne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpeter J<0xC4><0x81>nis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zari<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, quartets Quadra and RIX, and even Estonian acrobat M<0xC4><0x81>rti<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> Cons.
New works have also been created especially for the festival.
In the performance for children "Insect", created by Olesja Kozlovska and J<0xC4><0x93>kabs N<0xC4><0xAB>manis, along with Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, musicians and actors will participate entomologist (insect researcher) U<0xC4><0xA3>is Piter<0xC4><0x81>ns.
Oskars Herli<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> has written the first String Quartet, while Anna <0xC4><0xB6>irse has written the Tree Opera, a performance whose main characters in the direction of Andris Kalnozols with video projections by Katr<0xC4><0xAB>na Neiburga and stage design by Andris Egl<0xC4><0xAB>tis will be trees in three small clusters in a three-hectare wide bare felling.
Singing in the voices of Laima Ledi<0xC5><0x86>a, Din<0xC4><0x81>ra Rud<0xC4><0x81>ne and Zigm<0xC4><0x81>rs Grasis, they will end up in romantic relationships, just like in the study of the Enlightenment-era Swedish natural scientist Karl Linnejs The Wedding of Trees (1729).

Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, she will appoint Garland to the Supreme Court as a judge.
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid is convinced that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merrick Garland as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland's approval since he was nominated by President Obama in March.
The Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell announced that the next president would choose who would replace the current Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalie.
During his conference on Thursday, Reid said he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.

Treats announces a nude photo calendar for women and men.
Treat magazine will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar in the style of Pirrell in the 1970s.
In its 2017 NU Musi calendar, it is planned to showcase the new supermodels, not naked celebrities.
At the beginning of this year, Steve Shaw, president of Treats magazine, announced that his erotic art magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy, because "Playboy is a men's magazine."
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's talking about the calendar, too.
In a press release about the creation of a calendar, Shaw said: "We must return to the depiction of lasting and classic nudity in pictures, where the female body does not confuse, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great work of art.
Models can send their photos electronically or personally to casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

The Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video review

A French court rejects a request to demolish shops in the “Jungle” refugee camp.
A French court rejected a request from the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the “Jungle” camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At a hearing this week in Calais, authorities said the state should demolish 72 self-made boutiques, where people sell goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for a few euros in self-made restaurants.
The Office of the Prefect of Calais indicated that these self-established enterprises should be demolished, as they constitute a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as pose fire and sanitary risks.
Representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because the food provided by the government and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, where the number of residents continues to increase.
They also pointed out that self-made boutiques and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those who need it most.
The Court of Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who had created 72 self-made boutiques, but it understands the concerns of the Prefect of Calais.
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food for people living in "extremely humble conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the camp cafe "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language classes and provides asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable minors unaccompanied by adults.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect a children's cafe.
A letter to the Guardian stated that the liquidation of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charities, Aid to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, said the number of people in the Jungle Camp had risen to 9,000, the highest since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
The United Kingdom acquires silver in the rugby-7 series battle, when the Fijian national team masterfully wins gold.
It is important to note that this is not the case in the case of the United States, but in the case of the United States, the United States and Canada.
Fiji demonstrated a master class in ball management, football, support game, and brutal force game, winning gold, the first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat brought a respectable prize of consolation - the silver medal, which was the third medal of Britain on that day. The British national team can be proud of their success in the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament, where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the first half of the day, the hard-fought semi-final, in which the Bocks team suffered a 7:5 defeat, probably rebounded to the United Kingdom in the final.
But in any case, Fiji is now in its best shape to win the team of 15 men.
Although unlikely, however, a known consolation for Britain could be the fact that at least one Brit won a gold medal. This is the head coach of the Fiji national team Ben Ryan - a former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost all the games in the rugby-7 series in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
Defeat is painful, but growth is amazing.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his comrades saw it as an encounter with several oncoming buses, and the World Series champions were 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau took the first touchdown.
In the last four minutes, also Jerry Tuwai increased the lead even more, making a right-wing landing.
This is the first time I’ve been to the United States.
Mitchell's great strength did not allow the typical Leoni Nakaravas to score three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji's score.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua landed in the right corner, securing the lead over Britain to 17-0.
After the rematch, Nakarava increased the lead even further and had more than a minute to finish... at the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some awkward British force techniques and crossed the line, gaining points.
The landing provided a result of 29:0.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play rugby-7 matches while the British were still studying.
In fact, it is true.
The British team made a big change in the half-time, breaking the Fijian line... four full minutes, which was good by the first half-time standards, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team play, scored a few more points for the Fijian team.
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market in Europe, in which it is expected to launch a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market.
You can’t help but wonder at Fiji’s lively attitude.
Mata Viliame made Fiji's victory even sweeter with another touchdown at the end of the game.
With the end of the game whistle, Fiji could begin to celebrate, but the British, after defeat, were able to sit down on the grass.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where in a very fierce battle both teams scored a touchdown and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half, Kyle Brown led the Box team, but in the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with brilliant craftsmanship and carried the ball between the poles, ensuring the British victory.
Marcus Watson, the brother of England's rugby player Antony, won a silver medal at the end of the game.
The trainer’s fight against cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in this race and that already expresses a lot.
From the first to the last stroke, the golden moment of Helen Glover and Heather Stanning played a special role in the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there are only two women on the boat, they were accompanied by the echo of Robin Williams, which inspired them to win the second Olympic gold medal in pair rowing for women, becoming the first women in British sports history to achieve such success.
They undoubtedly dominated, because for the 39th time they won an unsurpassed, unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes with the elegance of a swan glide over the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
After each gold medal in rowing, there is a team that is working hard to constantly improve their performance, and the biggest contribution to their success was made by the coach who did not know if he will experience this day 30 months ago because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated on and so it happened.
If not, it would spread all over the body.
The situation would become unmanageable.
It changes your vision a little.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
This trio was lucky enough that William could start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 mid-season and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if you can say so.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and walked 6, 10, or even 15 meters, although the doctor said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it all started.
Rowing in itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought at once was about Williams, who was very upset all morning and spoke more than usual under the influence of excitement.
Staninga, who has served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "It's been an emotionally hard week, but it means a lot to me."
It only confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The last 3 years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we would not have achieved anything, so a huge thank you to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can’t imagine a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have never lost a race in five years.
The pair reaches such an enormous speed that rivals can not compete.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to get closer, Staning and Glover's lead was too high.
We felt every moment.
Helen cried out, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
Keeping your focus is really important.
We had a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
It was not our intention to break records that day, but simply to row well and win the race, and that's what we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedding of Glover and television adventurer Steve Busch.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

In Spain, the capacity to reduce budget deficits is jeopardised by the inability to form a government.
A month ago on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to bring the deficit level to the euro area's 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).
It is estimated that despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's budget deficit stood at 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year, while Spain's deficit stood at 5.1%.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting short-term fiscal targets.
One of the reasons why the European Commission did not introduce sanctions against the two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many European Union countries.
Additional sanctions would only add to such a negative mood.
The European Commission’s decisions are inconsistent, agreeing on common rules from the outset and then failing to apply them in practice.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Vehmann, has pointed out that Europe loses credibility in this way, creating the impression among citizens that the European Union rules are recommendatory rather than binding.
The Commission has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the deadline for correcting the deficit to the end of this year for Portugal and 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to review the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Preliminary forecasts suggest that Portugal's target could be met in due course and that the deficit could be reduced to 2.5% of GDP already this year.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, the government of this country is obliged to implement austerity measures amounting to 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on controlling the cost of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year, the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year to 3.1% and in 2018 to 2.2% of GDP.
Moreover, over the next two years, the consolidation effort should amount to 0.5% of GDP annually.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have been unable to reach an agreement on the formation of a government for eight months now makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and the possibility of Spain holding early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year is increasing.
However, opinion polls show that the third election would not significantly change the political landscape in the country.
The most popular party is still the People's Party led by current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which would win 33% of the vote again.
The socialists have only slightly increased their popularity, while the anti-austerity party Podemos or Together We Can and Ciudadanos or Citizen’s popularity has slightly decreased.
The People's Party wants to get the Socialists and Ciudadanos involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
According to Rafael Hernando of the People's Party parliamentary group, if the government fails and parliamentary elections are held for a third time, Spain will become a pan-European mockery.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
In the fifth year of beach surveys, activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the amount of waste found is increasing every year, and this is mainly the fault of bathing visitors.
The most polluted places for bathing are in Riga.
In the capital city council, it is explained that bathing sites are cleaned up every day, but it is quite difficult to fight against dirty visitors.
In addition, the waste left on land can be washed into the water during rainfall, thus significantly impairing its quality.
Except for Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja beach and some places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of beaches in other parts of Latvia is critical.
This is the message from the "My Sea" campaign this week.
If you’re not sure what to do with your money, you’re not going to have to worry about it.
Unfortunately, this year that critical assessment has come into play.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of garbage on the beach 100 meters, perhaps even can exceed 200 units," says the representative of the expedition "My Sea" J<0xC4><0x81>nis Ulme.
He was called by Latvian Radio and was on the beach of T<0xC5><0xAB>ja, where volunteers continue their march along the Gulf of Riga.
This year, amongst various household waste and picnic remains, activists had to collect even fluorescent light bulbs left in the sand of the sea.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the process of decomposition, they are no longer identifiable, and butchers, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the dirtiest beaches there are also bathing places in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgr<0xC4><0xAB>va almost 800 pieces of waste have been collected on average every hundred meters, which is a critical amount.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug is not recommended for children under the age of 3 years.
“The average numbers of all three bathing sites in Riga – Daugavgriva, Vakarbulli and Vec<0xC4><0x81><0xC4><0xB7>i – unfortunately are high and far exceed the desired goal, or to which Latvia is supposedly moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 by 2020,” concludes the environmental defender.
It’s not just a matter of how much you spend, but also how much you spend.
However, the struggle with unclean visitors is quite difficult.
We come back to the culture of these people.
"For those who fertilize, drink alcohol, smoke and do all those things that should not be done, even special signs do not work," says Insider.
Therefore, Viduskis invites bathing visitors to report the polluters to the police as well.
You can call the police, boldly point out these violations and thus all fight.
Perhaps some new warnings can be made, but as I said, it is unlikely that this will radically change the situation.
"As we all have to act together and be intolerant of such offenders," he said.
This is the first time that the water quality measurements have been carried out by the Health Inspectorate, which may impose a ban on official bathing areas.
This year, like all other years, the water quality is good and satisfactory.
The situation today is that all 56 bathing sites have been of good quality all along and there are no bathing restrictions.
"For the last time we will take the analysis at the end of August," says Normunds Kadi<0xC4><0xB7>is, the senior specialist of the Inspectorate in environmental health matters.
Waste left on land during heavy rains can be washed into water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, according to the environmental specialist.
The rotation in the elite of Russia continues - the change of the head of Putin's administration.
He quit his job?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov wanted to leave the office himself and will continue to be the president’s special representative for nature conservation, ecology and transport.
Announcing the changes, Putin paid a tribute to Ivanov in front of television cameras: "Dear Sergey Borisovich, we have been working with you for many years and are doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with the way in which you are performing your duties.
I well remember our agreement not to use you as head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
Therefore, I am conscious of your desire to change the field of action.
And I hope that you will make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new position as well.
However, it is emphasized that the leadership of the presidential administration is a very important position and this made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the upcoming elections of the State Duma in Russia next month, rumors have been raised that this step is related to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a possible substitute for Putin in the office of the President, so the claim that he himself wanted to hold the position of the representative of the President in matters of nature protection and transport, raised doubts.
It’s a great way to make sure you’re getting the most out of your day.
Ivanov was an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in the intelligence services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
In turn, at the end of the reign of the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin was appointed secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanov’s “Information Security Doctrine” was approved, which included reviving state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, but already in 2005 - Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of enterprises of the Russian defense industry and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the position of the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also keep his seat in the National Security Council of Russia, where the new head of the presidential administration, Vaino, will work.
The blame comes from the family Soviet party elite.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you make.
Antons Eduardovi<0xC4><0x8D>s and I have known each other for a long time.
From the time we were in government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years, we've been communicating practically every day.
"Therefore, I am sure that after all the professional and personal qualities of character he is ready for this work," said Ivanov.
The blame comes from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karl held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including being its first secretary for ten years until 1988.
The online edition Meduza, with reference to the book "Estonian Self-Determination and Independence", writes that in the late 1980s Karl Vaino had asked Moscow for permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was refused and soon lost his job.
Shortly thereafter, Guino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino is a graduate of the Moscow Institute of International Relations and speaks Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's Protocol.
In the last few weeks, Russia has been shaken by the dismissal and even arrests of several high-ranking officials, including several county governors and federal representatives.
It’s a great way to make sure you’re getting the most out of your day.
One of the main features - more and more often representatives of power structures are appointed to leading positions.
Also judo wrestler Nikiforenko loses in the first battle of the Olympic Games.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo wrestler has finished his participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in the 17th place.
If you’re looking for a new job, then you’re looking for a new job.
He also discovered that the judo wrestler had a shoulder injury in the fight.
It is noteworthy that in order to get to the Olympic road sign, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - namely, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani wrestler was 25 kilograms heavier.

This is the first time I’ve been to the United States.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
This Thursday was preceded by the Judist Yevgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent in front of him, but the ambitious can sometimes surprise him.
He didn't.
This is the first time I’ve been to the United States of America.
The result is similar, although he stayed on the tatami for almost a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, Latvian judists lack the most ambitions.
If you want to know more about how to get rid of snoring, then you need to know what to do about it.
Jackevich, who advises Kazakh Judists here, and Vsevolod Zeloniya do not see the heirs.
But if they don’t grow up, they won’t either.
This is the prerogative of the federation.
This is why the President of the Latvian Judo Federation promised to win medals in Rio, as from another galaxy in the "Morning Panorama".
Flight far from reality.
In the evening we were looking forward to the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/<0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as already in the "death" group - for the losers the game is over.
The Latvian duo, however, had a slight deviation - they could also lose, but with no more than four points in two sets.
The tension has been heightened by the long-running previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windy court swirled throughout the match.
The rushing wind caused additional difficulties for the players.
At first, it seemed that this could be our - which is more comprehensive - ally.
But he didn't.
It was easy to play against the Latvian duo here.
Serve Samoilova and wait for him to tear.
This is a great way to get to know each other better, and to get to know each other better.
It’s also a great way to make sure you’re getting the most out of your day.
If you’re looking for a job in the United States, you’ll want to find a job in the U.S., and you’ll find a job in the U.S., and you’ll need to be able to work in the U.S., and you’ll be able to work in the U.S., too.
It’s a great way to make sure you’re getting the most out of your day.
The third one was already in the Evandru Servus sign.
A chain was formed - inconclusively taken as a service, the second pass often fly too close to the net and Samoilov had very few options for a successful attack.
If there was a stranger Samoilov against the Cubans on the field, then this time he was more successful, and it would be unprofessional to pass the loss only to Sasha.
This is the first time I’ve been to the United States and I’ve been there for a long time.
Team loses.
This time, there was definitely a lack of luck - in the third set alone two Evandra attacks almost flew out of the court, but the ball nevertheless hit the line.
Two of them were next to the line.
The disputed episode of the video was also decided in favor of the opponents.
If you’re not sure what you’re looking for, then you’re not sure what you’re looking for.
All together we lost on the scoreboard.
Now it is necessary to calmly analyze the causes of failure.
Perhaps it was necessary to live like many people next to the stadium, rather than with the delegation in the Olympic village.
Two and a half hours went by.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
Perhaps Klagenfurt should not have played, but come here sooner and better acclimatize.
Perhaps there was a failure in finding the top of the sporting form.
For now, more questions than answers.
The games for our beekeepers are over.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
This is the first time I’ve been to the United States and I’ve never been to the United States.
But it is not necessary either.
When the dream about the Olympic medals has broken, the idea of divorce may also arise, because the blame will be sought not only in oneself, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to get a divorce, but it will be much more difficult to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play bee, but John and Tom have already tried and also divorced, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the tops of the world.
It is possible to try to return to M<0xC4><0x81>rti<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC4><0xBC>avi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> by Haralds Reg<0xC5><0xBE>s, Aleksandrs Solovejs, Edgars To<0xC4><0x8D>s, but it will not be better than this variant, which has proven itself several times in World Cup stages.
Copacabana sand did not smile at them this time.
That's all.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new couples are coming into circulation, and only the rare ones are less than two meters tall.
It does not yet guarantee success, but is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Ours doesn't stay taller.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the places offered by the game organisers, as well as to choose their own.
The US national basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Copacabana.
This time, the prices for the rather modest accommodation offered to journalists were greatly exaggerated.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the rent of apartments.
The risk is because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time, the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich we rent apartments on the border of Copacabana and Ipanema.
The beach is 200 meters away, the arena is half an hour walk away.
The district is quite safe, because favelas are far away, however, vigilance should not be lost here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not something that some immediately think about, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It looks like another medal dream was dreamed of on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86>a fell behind her personal records in the 100-metre barrier race and high jump.

In Latvia, the opera "Porgy and Bess" was first staged at the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
Since then, the internationally acclaimed masterpiece has not been repeatedly staged.
That is why the organizers of the C<0xC4><0x93>sis Art Festival and Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Art Forum, in close cooperation, have decided to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin’s <0xC5><0xA0>ederva.
"We are very pleased that after a ten-year break, when the last time Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja could enjoy the opera production, this excellent version of George Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" opera is available in our new, newly opened concert hall "Great Amber", says Baiba Bo<0xC5><0xBE>e, the director of the concert hall "Great Amber".
Opera "Porgy and Bess" is a vivid musical story about love, its inconsistency, passion, as well as everyday tragedies and simple everyday pleasures.
It reflects Afro-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is precisely this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and somehow really deep," says director Viesturs Kairi<0xC5><0xA1>s.
What I like the most about listening to or performing this opera are always the stops - the famous melodies, the famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another, or the choir or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this building", the opera is appreciated by the musical director and conductor of the opera "Porgy and Bess" concert production Andris Poga.
The visitors of the opera agree that this is a grand event.
They are very happy to hear this world-famous opera by Gershwin.
Thankfully, you can feel the breath of the world in Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja.
"Execution professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert studio was special because in the newly opened concert hall "Great Amber" for the first time an orchestra played in the orchestra's pit and for the first time an opera concert was performed.
The square next to the renovated building of the Art Museum could be named after Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls.
Riga Vice Mayor Andris Ameriks announced at the opening of the Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls anniversary exhibition that in the future the museum’s own address could be not Kri<0xC5><0xA1>j<0xC4><0x81><0xC5><0x86>a Valdem<0xC4><0x81>ra iela 10a, but Ja<0xC5><0x86>a Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls laukums 1.
If you’re looking for a new job, then you’re looking for a new job.
Riga city laid a kind of foundation for this idea in 1936, creating Burkards Dzenis monument to Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls, who stands next to the museum.
The then director of the museum, Vilhelms Purv<0xC4><0xAB>tis, was one of the initiators of the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I have a little bit of a conscience all the time - but Vilhelms Purv<0xC4><0xAB>tis, where are we going to put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think," said Lace.
It has been reported that after a major reconstruction and modernization, the National Museum of Art building officially opened its doors in May this year.
This week, the reconstruction of the VEF Culture Palace will finally begin.
The castle will be restored by SIA "Velve" for about 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several rooms of the castle, including two spectator halls, as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
The European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
"Despite the fact that the political will to start repairing VEF Culture Palace, involving European structural funds, is, we are waiting for a decision for months, real action from officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether the money will be allocated or not," says Burovs.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you take the decision yourself that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
We are now seeing another round of discussions emerging, so let's see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council no doubt guarantees that this process will be initiated and completed within the deadlines," Burovs said.
It has been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Palace collectively held a farewell concert before, immediately, the upcoming renovation of the building.
Although a year has passed, the renovation of the building has still not started and collectively continued to work under inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga City Council Property Department, the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent reconstruction work groups, each of which will ensure the implementation of different functions of the palace.
The first is to increase the availability of the VEF Culture Palace and improve the surrounding territory.
It is planned to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
The second is to improve the services offered by the VEF Culture Palace.
It is planned to restore the interior, walls and ceiling of the building, to improve the stage and sound recording studio, as well as to arrange the internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improvement of collective working conditions for creative amateurs, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" you can get to know the legendary rock band at the exhibition in Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja.
The exhibition will show a variety of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vas" characterizing objects - photographs arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from its inception until 2010, when it is announced that the group's activities will end.
The participants will also be shown their stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings, as well as other items that have not yet been seen by the general public, which reflected the creative work of the band "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with objects from the collection of the Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Museum.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
The musicians, who were associated with the band "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi" and their relatives, also responded to the invitation and shared both objects and memories.
The origins of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" can be traced back to 1972, when a vocal-instrumental ensemble was formed in the Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Culture House, led by Juris Pav<0xC4><0xAB>tols.
The ensemble in its original composition participated in the festival "Liep<0xC4><0x81>jas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in city and republic shows.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place when Juris Pav<0xC4><0xAB>tols met <0xC4><0x92>riks <0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xA3>elis and founded a group in the Palace of Culture of Metallurgs, inviting Ingr<0xC4><0xAB>da G<0xC5><0xAB>tmane, Andris Kr<0xC5><0xAB>zins and J<0xC4><0x81>nis Groduma to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has changed several times.
Participants have joined, others have gone their own way, some have returned.
However, the most important thing – the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist – has remained unchanged.
"There was no shortage of things to see - denim, hairy and bearded, these boys were significantly different from the generally accepted stereotype of the pop singer," says Klass V<0xC4><0x81>vere, a music reviewer, about the group.
In addition to the above mentioned musicians, the group included such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krievi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, Modris <0xC5><0xA0>terns, Valdis <0xC5><0xA0>tarks, Laimis R<0xC4><0x81>cen<0xC4><0x81>js, T<0xC4><0x81>lis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Br<0xC4><0xAB>ze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomas Kleins and many others.
Entrance to the exhibition is free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 to October 30.
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market.
For the first time in 8 months, Bulgaria is experiencing inflation.
In July, Bulgaria's national statistics showed monthly inflation of 1%.
This is the highest rate since 2012 and the first above-zero rate since October last year, when it was positive (0.2%).
Compared to the previous year, annual average inflation by CPI in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8%.
Compared to the previous year, consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.9% and monthly average inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate was -0.2% (in July 2016 compared to December 2015) and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% (compared to July 2015).
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was a price increase for the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural activities (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices of wearing apparel and footwear decreased (2.2%); domestic appliances, household appliances and regular household cleaning (0.5%); health (0.1%).

Many are already on the way to the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will the faithful receive there this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main church service in Aglona has been expressed by the Pope’s nuncio.
The content of the message is also up to him.
It is also a kind of tradition that the Way of the Cross is led by Bishop J<0xC4><0x81>nis Bulis.
He, too, will make his own message.
I was a vigilist the day before.
Last year I turned to Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato si and updated the common house, the theme of the Earth, in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I watch what is happening in the world and try to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church’s recommendation that the Gospel message be put at the centre of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and inspires them on their way.
Then it speaks to people.
But in C<0xC4><0x93>sis, in the Lampa discussion, you said that "you have to return to the understanding of the full man".
What do you mean?
Does this mean that a person turns away from the message of the church?
And does the church have the resources for such a return today?

This year, the number of residents in Riga has decreased
At the beginning of this year, there were 638 784 residents in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when the capital had officially registered 641 000 residents, the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) informed LETA.
In terms of the number of inhabitants, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and large cities with more than one million inhabitants.
According to Eurostat data, Riga has the highest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is convincingly in the first place among the largest cities of Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in Europe’s largest cities: in Vilnius, 123 women per 100 men, and in Tallinn, 121 women per 100 men.
Warning pictograms will be placed near the LNMM.

This summer Riga municipality has installed two more new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkalns, which are already available for children.
<0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xAB>psala beach has a spacious, multifunctional toy ship with various climbing elements, bridges, games, trubs and slides.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
The square is also equipped with swings and various balancing elements.
The fantasy world for small boaters is enhanced by the location of the attraction on the bank of the Daugava with a view to the passenger port and the cruise ships that can be seen there.
In turn, the playground between the 4th and 5th cross lines of <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkalns has a playhouse, a trampoline, a stepping track, a balance bridge, swings, toy balls and other game elements, as well as a gymnastics area with circles for strength and coordination training, along with other sports elements.
Under the square is laid rubber cover in different colors.
To the playground from the side of the street there is a new, colorful pavement.
The reconstructed road section has been opened in Medumi.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of the State Roads of Latvia (LVC), as well as the construction company Binders Ltd. and representatives of local governments today opened the reconstructed section of the main state road Russian border (Grebneva) - Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.5 km).
Roads are the business card of the country, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the situation on the country's main roads improving thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds.
"According to the forecasts, the funds available for roads in this planning period will be used already in 2018, and we must think about how to continue maintaining the most congested roads in a very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without the financing of the European Union," Uldis Augulis said, cutting the symbolic ribbon.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that the proposals prepared by the traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvia’s roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
The construction works from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km) were started by Binders Ltd. last year and continued this year after a technological break.
Reconstruction costs are EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
“In the reconstructed section of the road, the construction of the road has been completely restored and next year the repair works will be started in the next section from Medumi to Daugavpils, thus the whole road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged,” said J<0xC4><0x81>nis Lange, Chairman of the Board of the LVC.
The main roads of the country are the most busy, and by 2018 we plan to make all the main roads of the country in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring periodic maintenance in a timely manner and to perform the replacement of the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"This, of course, will require adequate funding, and all travellers look forward to the proposals developed by the expert group for improving the road financing system," Lange noted.
Within the framework of the project, road connections and lighting are arranged in Medumi Centre.
Significant earthworks have been carried out: large-scale thawing and extensive excavation and embankment works in four stages, and the longitudinal profile of the road, which until now was very uneven, has been leveled.
Public transport stops have also been renovated and a turning point for public transport has been rebuilt.
Previously, the road had insufficient load-bearing capacity and the terrain was not visible due to mountainous valleys, as well as the old road common terrain.
In the next construction season, it is planned to restore the road section from the Daugavpils city border to the currently reconstructed section (144.80-156.40 km).
This year, the LVC plans to carry out various types of work on more than 1100 kilometres of national roads.
It’s a great way to make sure you’re getting the most out of your day.
"To achieve the desired results of weight loss, the right choice of food combinations is very important," says Lithuanian dietitian Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to do in the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A well-thought-out combination of nutritional products can not only help to reduce excess weight, but also purposefully promote various processes in the body.
Pasta and vinegar are a successful combination, as they provide a long-lasting feeling of satiety and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel cheerful.
Cayenne pepper and protein-rich foods, such as poultry or protein shakes, not only create a feeling of satiety, but also reduce cravings after large meals at subsequent meals.
Such a combination of dishes is able to increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies have shown that cayenne pepper can help get rid of layers of fat in the abdomen.
Eggs contain a metabolic nutrient - choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Adequate intake of these nutrients can reduce cortisol levels and hence the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
Oatmeal porridge, to which fresh berries are added, is another delicious and fat-burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fiber that, according to the findings of Canadian scientists, controls ghrelin - an appetite-stimulating hormone - and therefore also a feeling of hunger.
In addition, the berries contain polyphenols, which are helpers in weight loss, and also prevent the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to do wonders in weight loss.
Such a combination is able to create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so they promote satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the process of digestion and provide a feeling of satiety for a long time.
For lunch you can eat chicken with salad or make a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products should be avoided.
Fruits contain sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, starch contained in vegetables is a polysaccharide.
Fruits break down in the stomach mechanically, while chemically they do not break down until they reach the third or fourth stage of the digestive process that occurs in the intestine.
Starch breaks down into three different stages, which begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When eating sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "stuck" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to rot.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate foods with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme pthialine, which is present in saliva, acts only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates, but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
For their processing, different digestive juices are needed, each with different strength, features and time when the stomach should arrive.
Watermelon, honeymelon, nutmeg and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach along with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with starch, however, the same can not be said about fats and proteins - fats inhibit the digestion of proteins.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If you consume large amounts of protein products, avoid fat altogether.
This also applies to freshening - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (contains protein) with a whole avocado (contains fat).
This combination prevents effective weight loss.
How better to cook?
"Cooking, heat treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of the products," says the dietitian.
In most cases, nutrients go to waste when cooking foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases by direct boiling.
It is recommended to use the liquid left over after cooking the vegetables to make the soup - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water, and you can eat them later.
It is recommended to cook vegetables, also steaming them.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the lycopene contained in tomatoes.
When boiling tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Heat treatment of eggs and meat deprives them of the natural properties of the proteins they contain, making them easier to digest.
Also, the heat treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to be absorbed by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to up to 90%, but the freezing of fiber does not affect it.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase the intake of iron into the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our bodies absorb up to 33% less of the non-blood-producing iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, and cereals than the blood-producing iron found in animal products such as beef, fish, and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blood-forming iron by eating non-blood-forming iron products in combination with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change the non-blood-forming iron so that it is more easily absorbed by our body.
Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which ensures the delivery of oxygen to the muscles and the brain.
To get the most out of the salad, add healthy fats to it, such as olive or linseed oil.
When making salmon sandwiches, add vitamin D-rich salmon or sardine-free yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the gut and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) together with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, black currants, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help stabilize cholesterol levels, as well as prevent artery blockage.
Snapchat's "Anime" effect criticized for Asian caricature
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators claim that it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to change reality and play with their identities in a rather absurd way.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that fits into Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
Lenses are foggy, image-distorting tools that generate over 30 million converted selfies per day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public.
Snapchat’s lens effects have been criticized in the past for promoting over-black or light skin tones as a benchmark for perfect beauty.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to create crooked eyes, crooked teeth and round cheeks, and some critics called it a racist Asian caricature – the “yellow face”.
The question was also asked whether such inconsistencies do not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public denials flared on Wednesday, when "The Verge" and "Motherboard" announced that the lens effects had been removed from the application.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to portray Anime characters, not to caricature people of Asian descent.
However, for people who have experienced racism, these effects were reminiscent of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity with Anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, said the effects of the lens were "offensive and uncomfortable, to say the least."
She added that it is difficult not to notice the obvious similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This suggests that the lens effect is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into this cultural trap.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the gadgets we use every day.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people of different races, unlike older people, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "today such things do not go unnoticed," 25-year-old Katy Jou said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Media’s product manager, Jou, removed his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and in a telephone interview, she explained that in her opinion, race problems are caused by Snapchat's employment policies, which do not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Jou criticized the management of the company, which is mostly composed of white men, and then closed his article with the reference <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Does the company employ a few people of other races, but they do not hold a position that allows them to express their opinion safely and comfortably," believes Zhou, a Chinese-American.
Her opinion is shared by others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are represented by different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origins of its employees, but its spokesperson revealed that the company has hired a staff specialist who will focus on also representing racial minorities, who are under-represented and will promote integration into the company.
Jou won’t update his Snapchat account, adding: “Interesting is whether they really need more users like us to understand that it’s wrong.”
The House of Congress says military officials have misrepresented reports about the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the House of Congress said the US Central Command had skewed reports depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistically than it actually is.
Central Command intelligence analysts express general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the task force set up by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Republican representatives of the Defense Finance Sub-Committee, saying their leadership controlled reports of American success in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news of the report is that intelligence reports, confirmed by senior Centcom executives, reflect the US fight against terrorism more positively than they actually are. The facts were regularly distorted, depicting better achievements than other intelligence analysis suggests.
California Republican Ken Calvert said: “Centcom’s actions are unacceptable – our soldiers are the ones who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports.”
Mistakes in the management of Centcom are to be found in the organisation's top management.
This 10-page report details the ongoing problems in the Central Command’s portrayal and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While this does not provide conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials have misrepresented the reports, it does show that Centcom management has exerted some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that in the first half of 2015 the press releases, statements and reports of the Central Administration to Congress depicted the situation in a significantly more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom representatives publicly stated that the operation to recover Mosul could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under the control of the Islamic State.
A spokesman for the Kansas Republican Party, Mike Pompeo, said in a statement: “An investigation lasting several months clearly confirms this.”
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, US Central Command chiefs spoofed reports depicting ISIS threats in Iraq weaker than they actually were.
The Republican Party formed a working group after learning that analysts were concerned that information about the Islamic State was being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in the case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence investigates the activities of the intelligence services of Centcom.
The Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own report on Thursday in which they agree with some of the Republican working group’s findings.
According to a report by Democrat Adam B. Schiff, between 2014 and 2015, Centcom over-restricted intelligence reports related to ISIS and Iraqi security forces.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information, worsened the ethics of analysts' work, and "spread untrue facts."
But Schiff and Democratic members added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports in line with “predetermined or political positions.”
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon’s General Inspectorate had opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report while the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Department call for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (an allegation made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations cast doubt on whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hawker published a study claiming that the Bush administration started the Afghan war with too little thought about its possible consequences.
Hoeker also played an important role in the unveiling of the Islamic State's intelligence issue.
Last year, officials reported that Hawker's team found that, contrary to public reports, airstrikes on Islamic State's oil plants did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The September edition of The Times reported that this discovery did not go beyond the walls of the Central Office.
General Lloyd Austin III, the commander of Centcom at the time, received sharp criticism because many lawmakers believed that the war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
In the United States, in a duel with the United Kingdom in women's field hockey, the United States wins, thus winning the fourth victory in a row.
If you’re looking for a job in the United States, you’ll want to find a job in the U.S., and you’ll need a job in the U.S., and you’ll need to be able to work in the U.S., and you’ll need to be able to get a job in the U.S., too.
Five goals in two games is an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said she couldn’t remember if she’d ever succeeded.
She said, "I have no idea."
I am not one of those people who counts their score.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the application of this Regulation.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play their final match in the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the game will determine only which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and which will take the second.
The first place winner will avoid meeting with the strong Dutch team, which is the leader of the second group, for a little longer.
If you’re looking for a new job, then you’re looking for a new job.
Bama was also on the team.
She grew up in Bloomberg, took a field hockey stick for the first time at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already engaged in this sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming the youngest player in the history of the team.
She didn't go to the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make it to the final.
But 2012 was an unfortunate year for her and her team.
The following year, Englishman Crag Parham was appointed as the coach of the team, and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical change."
We didn't do as much work in London as we do now.
We have changed everything.
This is the first time I have ever seen a man in my life.
India started the game without a win on their account, but their team was very fierce and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama scored again.
She pushed the ball into the opponent's zone on the left side of the field, then managed to get to the middle of the field and shoot the ball into the opponent's goal, putting the American woman in the lead 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzalez scored another goal.
This was the first dry game of the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, with each of the first three games being scored in a single goal.
She's in.
And so is Bama.
"We're doing very well right now," Paham said, but just how good the game will show on Saturday.
The most depressing food of the depression period is "Sourcing Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his election as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down in the oval room for a meal.
President Roosevelt was fond of fine culinary delicacies such as goose liver p<0xC3><0xA2>té, or fuagre, and Maryland tortoise soup.
But on that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and in dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Siegelmann says: "This is a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who have been very hard hit."
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds: "It's also a message to Americans how to eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights area are food historians.
Kou's last book, Vegetable Stew, describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmane in his book, 97 Apples, describes life through a meal at a rental house in the eastern lower part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work, "The Rich Meal," published Tuesday by Harper, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Showing a certain solidarity in cooking, they had a meal together at the reporter's Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple luncheon in the Flatiron district, which has been running since 1929, when the Great Depression began.
The 54-year-old Mrs. Ziegelmane ordered a sandwich with melted cheese and chopped olives, while the 57-year-old Kou ordered a salad of turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the fake bunny, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for the conversation about the food of the time of the Great Depression.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said that the forged hare was very popular.
There was a peanut bunny, a liver bunny, and a bean bunny.
They were made from the main ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it's like to eat so many peanuts for lunch.
Mr. Kou got bored.
"It seemed like the stomach was full of lead," he added.
During the pre-depression years, the American dining table resembled a swedish table, especially in rural areas.
The women cooked for their husbands-workers and at breakfast, lunch and dinner were served freshly cooked casseroles.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who sent food to Europeans. The "sour meal" describes how Americans adapted to the conditions when America suddenly ceased to be the land of abundance.
“Food became the focus of the American people’s daily lives at that time,” Mr. Kou says, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about this particular subject.
The new budget diets became just as important: unfamiliar dishes such as the fake bunny and stews became commonplace, stews were a "great way to use the leftovers," Ms. Ziegelmane said, as cooks could hide the unattractive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which for years was the main ingredient of American meals, has now become an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when the number of calories and nutritional value of food was more important than taste, new, yet unseen formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs. Siegelmann found a recipe for making onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr. Kou adds: "It was not a popular addition to the dining table."
Mrs. Ziegelmane emphasizes, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and fried onion are incompatible.
Many recipes of home cooking adapted to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Household Economics from 1923 to 1943, determined the country’s eating habits that were not seen before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised housewives to become "economists" and take on challenges such as turning a mix of pasta and carrots into a delicious meal.
"Satisfactory Meal" is a meal of historical delicacies.
Particularly interesting is the evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
Although in public he talked about his simple childhood and eating in Iowa, in fact he ate like the fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou says: "He liked European cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in the almost gilded living room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set an example by his eating habits.
According to the book, Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who could not cook, so the White House became a place "where not only was served one of the most delicious dishes in Washington, D.C., but also the worst-cooked dishes".
As soon as the country's economy recovered, most of the culinary customs of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrition, as well as how to apply science in cooking, added Mrs. Ziegelmane.
The couple says that by writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelmanes’ mother’s eating habits, for example, why she couldn’t throw out the food.
"She was really afraid of throwing food out," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said, "She actually seduced people."
Once there was an incident with the wind cakes.
After we had eaten in Eisenberg’s diner, a couple of writers pulled out of their bag a homemade dessert: the plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat for lunch.
"It's a plum whipped cream," Ms. Ziegelmane said, adding that it was a common habit at the time to give modest dishes a chic name.
There is no whipped cream in it, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone impatiently soaked the spoons in the brown mass that were on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more bites.
Sounding like an experienced "economist," he told his wife: "A pinch of ground hazelnut would come."
Gilead will get a refund for legal expenses in battle with Merck for Hepatitis C patent
A district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to a refund of the legal fees it paid in the case of the breach of the Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of a <0xC2><0xA3>200 million fine for the breach of two Merck patents, which threatened her in connection with the successful tablets of Sovaldi and Harvoni, when a US federal judge found irregularities in Merk's activities, such as swearing-in and other unethical acts.
At the hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bet Labsson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to claim compensation for the legal costs it had incurred in defending itself in the case.
Merck is trying to gain positions in the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of Hepatitis C drugs that are effective in 90% of cases of liver diseases.
The case was launched already in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, a key component of Gilead's drug.
U.S.-backed forces claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbij from the Islamic State.
US-backed forces have taken full control of the city of Manbij in northern Turkey and the last Islamic State troops have left the city, a group spokesman said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently clearing the city from the last rival fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages captured by the militants, Sharfan Darvish of the SDS-aligned Manbij military council told Reuters.
“At the moment, the city is under our full control and we are conducting a search for fighters,” he told Reuters.
The income of the Clintons reached 10.75 million dollars in 2015 and the couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned <0x24>10.75 million that year and paid the federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
During 2015, the Clintons donated <0x24>1 million, mostly to their own Clinton charity. Former president Bill Clinton earned about <0x24>5.3 million as speaker and former secretary of state earned <0x24>3 million from her book on working for the Department of State, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton’s ally, U.S. Virginia Senator Tim Kane and his wife, Anna Holtone, have made their tax return public for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set new standards for financial transparency," Clinton campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump hides behind various excuses and reservations to avoid keeping promises to disclose his tax information.
Publication of paid tax information is a record practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cite the State Revenue Service audit as a reason for not disclosing tax information.
It’s important to remember that you’re not the only person in the world who’s been around for a long time.
Trump’s special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release tax information until the audits had been completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, say his refusal raises questions about his real estate, donations and other business commitments, including those to Russia.
Clinton poured oil on the fire after releasing a video on Friday in which several powerful Republicans asked Trump to release his tax information.
She returned to this issue again during an economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have done for decades."
In the 1990s, Trump paid very little or no tax, according to Politico, and on Friday, the author of a New York Times business column reported that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in these presidential elections.
In support of Billionaire Warren Buffett’s proposal, Clinton promotes the idea that anyone earning more than <0x24>1 million a year must pay tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, during Clinton’s speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also based, Buffett invited Trump to exchange tax returns.
If you’re not sure what to do with your money, you’re not going to have to worry about it.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
The Clintons now live in Chappaqua, New York, and paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and a total tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax review shows that, unlike most Americans, only <0x24>100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton received <0x24>109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticizes hotel in Berlin for unlocking Israeli long-distance call code at the request of an Arab - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin has caused a storm on social media when he discovers that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli telephone code.
Claude Lantzman, director of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman tried to find the Israeli long-distance code on the list offered by the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been wiped out and destroyed?
Written by Lancman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call this country through its call centre.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lantzman writes that the answer he received "shocked her".
The hotel administrator explained that "it is a conscious decision of the hotel management".
The reason for removing the code further angered the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they demanded the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quoted a hotel employee as saying.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung said Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Had-Handelsman, had called the incident a “great disgrace.”
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
This in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened in Germany is even more humiliating in this hotel chain.
Explanations are not required.
The official said: "We hope the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event also had quite a wide resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski Hotel has simply indulged Arab customers.
Another record said, "Shame on," stating that the hotel was on Kurfurstendamm, next to the synagogue.
The Der Spiegel newspaper reported that the hotel itself quickly dismissed all the accusations, saying they were "a misunderstanding" and apologising to Lantzman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of country numbers," the Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a representative of Kempinski as saying.
And adds that the code has been added to the list again.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
Students and police clashed on Thursday in the Brazilian city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, where students gathered in a demonstration against the government's education reforms.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against the students.
The problems started when the ombudsmen tried to expel the students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration in order to show their dislike for the reforms of the education system.
The proposal by the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Governor, Geraldo Alckmina, envisages the closure of almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be relocated to other schools in order to save money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim president Michael Temer.
The protest came just days after students gathered for demonstrations in support of suspended President Dilma Rousseff, whose impeachment was voted for by the Senate.
Scott Kelums Skinner finishes first, bringing Britain a gold medal in cycling
Kelums Skinner from Scotland finished the first men's cycling team sprint race at the Rio Velodrome last night. The British team secured its title at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow played an important role in this race, making the legendary Scottish Sir Chris Hoy proud and knocking out the victory for the favorites of New Zealand.
Four years ago, Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated this at the World Championships in London, even though Hoy had already finished his athletic career.
The problems were in the period between the Beijing and London Olympic Games, because it was necessary to replace the experienced startup specialist Jamie Staph.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hoy left, Kian Emadi and Matt Krampton tried to fill his place.
The British coaches had hoped for Skinner, seeing the potential in him, which he later proved.
Hinds, Kenny - champions who started four years ago with Hoy and Skinner, who set the Olympic qualification record, but the race was better for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hindus were close behind their circles, Kenny took the lead, and Skinner protected the lead.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindes drove with a larger gear to allow Kenny and especially Skinner to drive faster.
Hoy watched the race as a representative of the BBC and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenya and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgower said: "It was an indescribable honor."
I'm doing my best to defend my word.
In the final, we set an Olympic record and beat the World Champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoya at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Hinds confessed that he deliberately fell on the track after a failed start.
He later refuted this comment and the British competitors were unable to prove the contrary.
This time there was no such incident.
The Hindus said, "British flags on the podiums reminded me of London."
Over the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so winning the Olympics was really special.
One medal in the race for the country, which won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of the progress of the team over the past five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Considering Kenya's result, he could indeed replicate Hoi's success in winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenny, it would mean six gold and one silver medal, and for Kenny, he was born on March 23 (it looks like it's the British holy date, because it's also the day that Steve Regrew, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were born).
Hoy was born on that date.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old Bolton said, "I just enjoy it all right now.
A team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
To be honest, it's a little lonely to win alone."
The Hindus said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be ranked knightly."
It was the only fight for medals that day, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steve Burke, and Owen Doul were the fastest four-kilometre drivers.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigin will definitely be the center of attention.
Yesterday, before the qualifying trip, he had a disagreement with the commissariat when the judges called him to measure his height.
In the women’s journey that will continue and end today, Laura Trott, Joanna Rovsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavia set a new record 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team, hopefully, will win medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Recalling the outstanding and unprecedented performances in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
In the meantime, behind the scenes, there have been various allegations of sexism and defamation, technical director Shane Sathon has resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendletton have also ended their careers.
However, with the start of the first cycling races, it seems that Britain will always reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland smelter is becoming uncertain due to the termination of an ambitious contract.
The future of the aluminum melting plant and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become uncertain as its main customer, the energy company, has announced the termination of cooperation.
The announcement is based on the Victorian government’s plans to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital to the company’s continued operation.
The 20-year subsidy will end in November.
As a result, more than 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2,000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, since the melter consumes about 10 percent of all Victorian electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the Anglesea plant being shut down.
The Alcoa Portland melter is operating at a loss and may be closed.
These events were caused by years of speculation about the appreciation of the Australian dollar and factory production costs.
The plant’s energy supplier AGL, which supplies power from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroubes Valley, says the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts as well.
The majority of the power plant is owned by the Alcoa and Alumia joint ventures, in addition to the company's shares are owned by China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding companies.
“AGL is looking forward to continuing the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supplies to the smelter,” a spokesman said.
AGL said the agreements were so-called "hedging agreements", which are due to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore expire in 2017.
“AGL expects to receive revenue from these contracts in the fiscal year 2017 as well,” the company’s spokesman said.
From the fiscal year 2018 onwards, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market expectations regarding future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims that it has already estimated a loss of <0x24>187 million in its forecasts for these contracts to be terminated.
Alcoa says that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue operating the smelter or supply it with energy.
The U.S. company says it has signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, but it will be terminated in November. The company does not provide any explanation as to why it will cease its cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concern about both the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the sector's weak economy.
AGL CEO Steven Mikelson said last week that analysts estimated Portland was using 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy per year.
If these two plants were to leave the energy market, energy demand would fall significantly.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected each year, and the situation could get worse with a budget cut.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal evictions - are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overloaded, warns that the situation will only get worse with a reduction in funding.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farrell, director of Queensland’s legal centre, said a recent report by the Association of National Legal Centers said thousands of people in need are currently being denied legal aid.
Mr. Farrell indicated that if this decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
He also says: "Queensland's legal centre is constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people in need are being denied assistance."
People who are trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debts, families who are going through divorce, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
From June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, which means that several thousand more Queenslanders will have to solve their complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately suspend cuts so that people in need of legal aid can get them.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to also pay attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and to the Palazczyk government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign sued in court for pulling out a gun
New York: Donald Trump campaigners are sued for failing to act after being told that his North Carolina chief of operations had turned a gun on an employee while they were in a car in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed in Charlotte court on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
Bordini said that he had been waiting for months for an internal hearing on the case, but that he had realised that this would not happen.
The driver, Earl Philip, "drew a gun, put his right index finger on the rooster and turned the barrel against Vincent's knee," Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that by submitting complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people have experienced the same thing.
“Guns don’t have to be fired to cause damage,” Bordini said in her complaint.
Just two days before filing the case, the Republican presidential candidate caused a scandal, announcing to the people that the "People of the Second Amendment", i.e. arms owners and enthusiasts, could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton wins the election and he elects judges.
Trump campaigners said the media had pulled his words out of context and he had never incited violence against anyone.
Bordini seeks compensation from campaign organizers for negligent supervision, and from Phillips for assault, illegal use of weapons, and emotional stress.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately comment.
I couldn't get in touch with Phillips.
WCCB - Charlotte local news agency reports that Philip recently left the campaign.
Also, it has not been possible to call his consulting company "Innovative Consulting Services".
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a contentious election campaign.

A new tradition - a parish and sports festival in <0xC4><0xB6><0xC5><0xAB><0xC4><0xBC>ciems.
This is the first time that people have come together for a festival and a sports event.
After ten years of celebration, this time it was decided that there would be no more Lake Festival.
A new page has been opened.
The day began with a sports competition.
This time the competition was not in traditional ways and too serious, because, for example, darts had to be thrown at a sleeping target, the boot flew, thrown with the left hand of a person, "balling" has not been at all at any Olympic Games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, brave, agile and resourceful he was.
After the sports games, everyone gathered on the open-air stage, where the parish festival began.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner", where the little ones could beat themselves in the inflatable attractions and get a new image in the face make-up shop.
A novelty that could also become a tradition was the parade of cars, where both tractors and motorcycles went.
It is also important to note that this is not the first time that a person has been diagnosed with the disease, but it is the first time that a person has been diagnosed with the disease.
The celebration continued with the welcome of the youngest inhabitants of <0xC4><0xB6><0xC5><0xAB><0xC4><0xBC>ciems.
It is really good that the parish has been supplemented with five girls and one boy.
In the event of a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this Regulation, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall inform the other Member States and the Commission of the reasons for the dispute.

Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only promote prosperity and growth in the local regions and in London, but throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as we did in London in 2012, where we put a huge amount of work in order for all regions of the country to benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Eastend won a huge amount of the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again, providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
We will create 10 000 new business opportunities for local communities alone, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the Heathrow area.
As at the London Olympics in 2012, there will be people who think that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
People said back then that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics on time and that it would be a global failure.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012 and in the case of Heathrow they will not be right either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole, not individuals.
Enlargement has the potential to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating a breeding ground for both employment and experience at the airport and across the UK.
Heathrow has a great team that has created an infrastructure investment programme worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, spanning the timeframe and budget from Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years, to Terminal 2, which has been built between the two most intensively used runways in the world.
They are now ready to build a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that the expansion of Heathrow will also be.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is a member of the Heathrow Board of Directors and former Secretary of Commerce of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman runs on a highway trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he slept on the highway.
Police are trying to find witnesses after several cars crossed the highway early Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in the canton of Vos.
A cantonal police report said the woman, desperate to commit suicide, lay down in the dark on a road where she was hit by several cars.
Clearly trying to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss man, crashed into several cars, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the application of this Regulation.
A criminal investigation has also been opened in the case, which is a logical step in this case, lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofsteller adds: "The prosecutor will find out."
Two similar incidents in the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be held liable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had walked out on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that there would be a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, according to the newspaper.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of murder by negligence when in August 2014 she drove off a man who slept on the A1 road near Paijerne in the middle of the night.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim had drunk and later managed to fall asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policewoman, who was on her way to the scene of the accident, was driving in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge admitted that the man lying on the road was “absolutely unpredictable and extraordinary”.
Anyone with information about the accident near Morges on Thursday is welcome to contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" has started collecting signatures for a new competition for the position of the Head of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
The petition addressed to the ministers of the National Union (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS) indicates that the public wants a transparent and professional process of nominating officials.
The petition was created on August 10 and has so far been signed by 55 people.
The process of nominating Inga Kolegova as the Director General of the SRS is opaque and unprofessional.
It reminds us of the best traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and once again disappoints the public in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be evaluated," the petition says.
It’s a great way to make sure you’re getting the most out of your day.
It is also unclear what kind of plans the candidates have for employment with the SRS.
The petition indicates that the State Chancellery should create a new open competition, in which professional candidates are actively addressed, personnel selection specialists are recruited and appropriate remuneration is offered.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 30a to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation.
If we lost, then I played badly.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the application of this Regulation.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 30a to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2).
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
If you’re looking for a new job, then you’re looking for a job that you’re looking for.

I don’t even know how we left the rest of the set without points.
You can't play like that.
After that, everything was fine in the second set and at the end of the set it was possible to break the game, and it was supposed to be a good base for the third set.
We started it similarly, but after we exchanged parties, the result grew only for one team.
We made too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so small points were important.
"I should have played more similarly, rather than giving 3-4 points in a row several times," said the athlete.
We knew Evandra could be saved.
In the first set we did it, in the second set we put in 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already left the game", remembered <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
We tried to show the best game.
Sometimes it happened, sometimes it didn’t.
It’s also a great way to get to know each other better.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
We were expecting a good service from Evandra, and we managed to do it quite well in the first sets, but in the third set the service opened for him and it was difficult to make an attack.
I, on the other hand, made a lot of mistakes at Pedro’s service, but I had to deal with it.
It’s also a great way to get to know each other better.
“We played, we played, we had defense, but we needed a better service,” he said.
"They played well and in the end came to a urra."
We said right before the tournament that the draw was the most inconvenient it could have been.
We also had a chance to fight for the first place, but we didn’t even get out of the group.
"All of us were expecting a medal, and we also ourselves, but then there is no difference - the 25th or the 4th," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo will continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no questions and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.

Latvenergo is following the process of opening the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The State energy company Latvenergo is following the process of opening the gas market from the position of both a consumer and a potential trader, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market as a trader in the future will be determined by the model of the gas market and the legal framework to be established."

The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 30a to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules for the application of the provisions of this Regulation in respect of the areas referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
When working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the aim of the EM is to make the process of trade in natural gas as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, the most effective and user-friendly service solution was chosen "the trader's central model", in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one information provision and customer service point, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the discretion of the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented for electricity trading.
We would like to remind you that the gradual opening of the market for household customers is planned – even after 3 April 2017, those household customers who do not wish to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue receiving natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related customers.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
In turn, the merchants will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom to conclude a natural gas trade contract.
Until entering into a natural gas trade contract, the merchants shall ensure trade in natural gas for a specified period of time by the previous natural gas trader for a price determined thereby.
The draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
This Regulation prescribes the procedures by which natural gas shall be supplied to users and its supply shall be discontinued, the requirements for safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of a trader, public trader, system operator, user and owner of a gasified object in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedures by which settlements for the received services shall be performed, the amount of late payment interest, the procedures for changing traders and the supply of users in the event of disruption of natural gas supply; the procedures by a public trader.

The company's management report said that in 2015 the company was operating at a loss due to a number of reasons, including a persistent lack of working capital due to the withdrawal of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, terminating a previously existing credit line and leaving the Blue Lagoon with contracts that could not be honoured.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and receive a volume discount.
The withdrawal of the respective bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing the European Union Structural Funds support projects, which would have allowed the factory to acquire new production equipment and modernise the infrastructure.
Last year, the company's financial indicators were negatively affected by the rise in the prices of raw materials and the reluctance of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers acknowledged price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new - the highest - prices," the company's management said.
Also in 2015 "Zil<0xC4><0x81> lag<0xC5><0xAB>na" started negotiations with potential investors, including valuation of the company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been to Unicredit Leasing, the company’s largest creditor, where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s operations and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of the technological processes leading to higher production productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment was purchased, which ensures a higher production speed," the company's management said.
The management of "Blue Lagoon" notes that the purchased equipment in 2016 will allow the company's production facility to fulfill orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of production, which will be produced on this equipment, will be ready in August.
Since the letters of intent for the sale of the product have already been signed, all the production will be sold in accordance with the letters of intent.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month," the company's management said.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
"Blue Lagoon" has sent the first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanded the market to Cyprus and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the United States.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase turnover.
In 2014, Blue Lagoon had a turnover of 6.347 million euros and a loss of 5.113 million euros.
The Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and has a fixed capital of 1.156 million euros.
The company is owned by two Latvian private individuals - Mikhail Kaidanov (89,11%) and Igor Shirson (10,89%).
You are welcome to meet the cinematographer Sara Leander at the museum and take part in the press conference at 15 p.m.
Riga can be considered the city of the beginning and inspiration of the career of the adored film diva Sara Leandere.
The visit of Sara Lendere to her godmother Ruta, who was the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, in 1924 turned out to be fateful, because she was the one who unveiled the unusual low counterpart for Sara Leandere’s woman, which she tried out by making her debut on the stage of the Riga Cabaret Theatre.
Perhaps it was the accidental curiosity in Riga that became the fateful turning point on Sara’s creative path towards world fame.
Riga was associated with warm memories for Sara Leander, and she hoped to come to Riga at the guest performances, but unfortunately, these expectations were not destined to come true, as the Second World War began.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible during the Riga City Festival 2016 and the role of the outstanding Zara Leandere will be played by the great Ieva Ker<0xC4><0x93>vica.
In the area of Aglona, extensive traffic restrictions have been imposed.
In order to ensure the safety of the participants of the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the truck transit traffic along several state roads in the vicinity of Aglona will be closed from August 12 at 17.00 to August 15 at 18.00, informed SJSC Latvijas Valsts ce<0xC4><0xBC><0xC5><0xA1>.

It should be taken into account that in the section of the motorway P62 Kr<0xC4><0x81>slava-Preili-Madona from Kr<0xC4><0x81>slava to Kr<0xC4><0x81>slava station (0.80-4.00 km) construction works are taking place and only public transport and pedestrians will be able to cross the construction site during the Aglona Festival.
For other traffic participants, traffic will be ensured on the bypass - a scheme in the attached file.
Traditionally, a large number of participants, including pilgrims, come to this festival.
Therefore, motorists should be especially careful, because on various road routes towards Aglona there will be intense pedestrian movement.
We invite drivers to treat the introduced traffic restrictions with understanding, to observe the traffic organization procedure, as well as to take into account the possible longer time spent on the road.

The insurer pays compensation to passengers on the cancelled flight at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance has paid out travel insurance compensation to a family for a flight cancelled at Riga Airport on Wednesday, August 10, which forced them to refuse to attend the planned music festival.
On August 11, an application for indemnity was received from a client in If Insurance.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but as this was not possible due to cancelled flights at the airport on Wednesday, the client was charged for the reservation of accommodation, which could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the purchased festival tickets in the amount of 204 euros.
In turn, the airline has promised to reimburse the money spent on the plane tickets.
If Insurance of all travel insurance indemnities in an average of 15% of cases has paid compensation for the interruption or cancellation of the trip.
"On such occasions, the expenses for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for the reservation of accommodation are reimbursed," says Dagnija Rutka, Head of the Insurance Product for Personal Risk Insurance.
As it is known, on the evening of August 10, due to technical problems, a private plane stopped on the runway of Riga Airport, therefore only several departing flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be redirected to other airports.

The problem is that my neighbors did an arbitrary construction and my apartment has a damaged ceiling.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, the house manager and other organizations.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have.
"The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Engineering Union and there will be an expert from there," says Dmitrijs.
The invited expert arrived, recorded what had happened and acknowledged that the covering was in an unsatisfactory condition.
However, a month has passed since Dmitry’s first application to the building board, and by the beginning of this week no one was able to answer whether staying in the apartment was not life-threatening.
It’s the same with the rest of the world, and it’s the same with the rest of the world.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they sent the house manager, then the house manager again to the building board, and then there is a dead end," says Dmitrijs.
If you’re looking for a job in the United States, you’ll want to find a job in the U.S., and you’ll need to be able to work in the U.S. for a few years.
In addition to the above, we may also share your personal information with third parties, such as advertisers, advertisers, and advertisers.
The independent expert has developed his opinion, but the building board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal lattice in this load-bearing construction is affected, therefore, there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is endangered.
“That’s why we have requested additional explanations from this expert,” says Ilze <0xC5><0xBD><0xC5><0xAB>ka, representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the prohibition to carry out any repairs in the upper apartment, from there it is still heard that the construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a building permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in a particular case the penalty can be much more severe.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to lay down common rules for the application of this Regulation.
"This is an unprecedented case in the practice of the building authority, when, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, residents may have created a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit their property," the representative of the building authority says.
Now Dmitry has to look for another place to live - with relatives, friends, in a hotel or rent another apartment.
But Dmitrijs can try to recover the losses from the neighbor in a civil procedure, which can take a lot of time.
Due to the arbitrary construction, it is currently prohibited to stay in both apartments until the construction engineer gives his conclusion, and it may take up to three weeks to wait for it.
The damage will have to be covered by the owner of the apartment in which the repairs took place.
If you’re not sure what to do with your money, you’re not going to have to worry about it.

The conversion of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The conversion of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" will cost 22 million euros, Gita <0xC5><0xBD>elve, a representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri", tells LETA.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the restoration of the former sanatorium in <0xC4><0xB6>emeri.
The second stage will be the wellness clinic, which is planned to open in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to open in May 2018.
<0xC5><0xBD>elve notes that the exact cost of the clinic at the moment is not yet known.
But she says it will be located in the building of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri resort polyclinic, which covers an area of approximately 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The owner of "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" and the planned clinic is the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have to make, but how much money you have to make.
As G Capital Europe CEO George Jones said earlier, it is planned to invest 12 to 15 million euros in the establishment of the former resort polyclinic, with a total investment of more than 30 million euros.
It has already been reported that the J<0xC5><0xAB>rmala City Council plans to attract 14.5 million euros from the European Union funds for the renovation of the cultural and historical park with an area of more than 42 hectares, for the renovation of access roads and street sections, for the construction of an interactive nature tourism object, for the improvement of the territory and for the construction of a parking lot on Em<0xC4><0xAB>la D<0xC4><0x81>rzi<0xC5><0x86>a Street, which will promote the socio-economic development of the city of Jurmala and increase the number of tourists.
The design works are expected to be completed by mid-2017, but construction and arrangement works will start in the autumn of next year.
As reported, in the historical sanatorium complex "<0xC4><0xB6>emeri" it is planned to create a five-star hotel "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" and "wellness" or wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction took a long time.
The 2010 report also stated that Ominasis was in regular communication with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to provide daily technical control of the sanatorium <0xC4><0xB6>emeri, and that already in 2011 the reconstruction of the future hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri would be completed and the preparations for the opening of the Kempinski chain hotel would begin immediately.
In October 2014, "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" confirmed its readiness to purchase the property of the insolvent "Ominasis Latvia" sanatorium <0xC4><0xB6>emeri at the auction, but a month later the auction was declared not to have taken place, because the winner had not paid for the purchase in due time.
The sale price was determined according to the starting price of the last auction - EUR 2.86 million.

The Order of the Three Stars award ceremony will take place at the House of the Blackheads at 13:00.
According to the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from J<0xC4><0x81>zeps Medi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> College of Music in 1998, where he studied wind instrument playing and singing with Margarita Gruzdeva.
He studied at the vocal department of J<0xC4><0x81>zeps V<0xC4><0xAB>tols Latvian Academy of Music in the class of Arv<0xC4><0xAB>ds Luste.
In 1997 he began to sing in the Latvian National Opera Choir, but in 1998 he made his debut with the role of Oberto in the opera "Alcina" by G.F. Handel.
He received the "Great Music Award 2003" for his vocal performances in opera productions and Verdi's Requiem.
It is noted that in the 2004/2005 season it has become the most internationally recognized Latvian tenor, which is engaged by the largest opera houses in the world.
Since autumn 2004, he has been singing at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf, the Berlin and Graz operas, the Semperoper in Dresden, the Royal Opera House in Oslo and Stockholm, the Covent Garden Opera House in London, the Monte Carlo Opera House, the Vienna State Opera, as well as the Opera House in Geneva, Dresden and Düsseldorf and the Salzburg Festival.

The e-mail of the former NATO commander Briedlov has been hacked by Russian hackers.
The hackers who hacked the computers of the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) may have carried out several other cyber-attacks, including hacking the emails of former NATO European Command commander Philip Briedlow and the George Soros Open Society Institute, the business news agency Bloomberg reported on Thursday.
The hackers published the information on DCLeaks.com.
It also contains, among other things, Briedlov’s correspondence and news about the work of the Soros Institute.
The hackers had access to the institute's computers for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, the cyberattacks were carried out by the same hackers linked to the Russian special services who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal reported that President Barack Obama’s administration is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of DNC computers.
In order to implement the sanctions, the administration will have to formally accuse Russia or hackers supported by the Russian authorities of a cyber attack on the Democratic Party's servers.
In July, WikiLeaks reportedly published some 20,000 emails extracted from the DNC's computer system, suggesting that Democratic leaders were trying to undermine the campaign of Hillary Clinton's former rival Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination to run for president.
According to U.S. press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which investigates the hacking of Democratic servers, as well as other U.S. intelligence agencies believe that Russia’s involvement in the cyber-attack is almost beyond doubt.
McCartney: Yoko Ono's presence threatened the Beatles.
Paul McCartney has admitted that Yoko Ono’s presence has created a sense of danger for the legendary band The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star is currently in a "good" relationship with the widow of the late John Lennon, but at the time she went to visit the band in the recording studio, McCartney was frightened because Ono was the only woman among the band's members - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When the singer was asked about the relationship between the two, he told Rolling Stone magazine: "It's really good."
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
The majority of the group could not tolerate this.
We were able to do it, but not very successfully, because we were very tense.
We weren't sexists, but the girls didn't usually come to the recording studio, they let us work.
When John began dating Yoko, she was not in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the Digital Single Market, which aims to ensure that the Digital Single Market is a reality for all citizens and businesses.
Asked if he still met the only living member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often not."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don't go to meetings, I feel a little disconnected from it.
I left Apple during a difficult divorce.
I sent John Eastman to my meeting place and said, "Tell me what everyone is saying, because I can't stand sitting at that table."
It was too painful to see our pet die.
The company now works in such a way that I just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus was once a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’s slow rotation speed is due to its dense atmosphere.
However, recent simulations show that Venus once had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and it revolved slowly.
The model also looks at Venus' earlier topography.
There have been more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there has been enough water and geographical diversity to allow life to form and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In a simulation of the GISS model, the Venus rotation model reveals that the bright part of the day lasts on it for 2 months, GISS scientist Antony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This process heats the planet’s surface and causes rain, which in turn forms thick layers of clouds that act as an umbrella, protecting the planet from the heat of the sun.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it was once habitable, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet rays for billions of years.
Its oceans were evaporated, and the globs were burned by ultraviolet rays.
As the water evaporates completely, only the thin carbon dioxide atmosphere with the deadly greenhouse gas Venus, as we know it today, remains.
The scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
In addition, it is important to ensure that you do not have to worry about the security of your personal information.
It’s important to remember that you’re not the only person in the world who’s been around for a long time.
“For the last three years, I have been performing my duties vigorously, passionately and purposefully as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations at the Colorado Club,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
During this summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I can improve the performance of the team in order to give it the necessary brilliance and achieve higher level results.
To achieve this, the visions of the head coach and vice president of operations in ice hockey must be fully aligned with the visions of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions relating to team performance.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sakik said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him well in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the best coach of the league and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the playoffs, Colorado was defeated by the Minnesota ice hockey players. Since then, the club has not been in the playoffs for two years.
Avalanche ended the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the Wild team without receiving the Western Conference organizers' second special invitation.
In his career, Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil rig workers resume talks and delay strike
If you’re looking for a new job, then you’re looking for a new job.
There are periodic strikes against the oil processing company "Wood Group" on the North Sea oil platforms where the company "Royal Dutch Shell" operates.
In a joint statement, Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
Several full-day meetings are scheduled in the coming weeks, starting early next week, with the aim of re-examining the issues at stake.
Trade unions said that their recent measures, organised after a break of more than 25 years, were aimed at a planned 30 percent cut in wages.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group cut wages in the North Sea by 9% this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the downturn in the market.
Shell has already cut salaries for thousands of people and announced plans to shut down oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise its operations in preparation for a large-scale merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling oil prices, and the British decision to leave the European Union makes the situation even more difficult.
At the beginning of the week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individuals.
In 2016, nearly <0x24>1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, compared to <0x24>7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the constellation Pleiade.
The latest mission of the Kepler telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalogue of the speed of rotation of stars in the constellation Pleiade.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in this constellation rotate at different speeds, as well as how the speeds of stars are related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with those of other constellations, we will gain more information about the relationship between star mass, age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luis Rebula, a scientist at Pasadena's Caltech Infrared Processes and Analytical Center.
The constellation Pleiades is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are just beginning to grow, reaching the age of about 125 million years.
They rotate at maximum speed.
At maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of star wind.
When winds enter the magnetic field of stars, they brake the stars.
As the stars age, their rotational speed decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by determining the time between the appearance of recognizable areas of stars, such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of the speed of rotation of stars shows that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller stars.
Rebuls compares stars with dancers, larger dancers perform pyruettes slower than smaller dancers.
Rebuls says that in the "ballet" of Plejade it can be seen that slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, whereas the fastest rotating objects are very small stars.
Due to the fact that the constellation Pleiades is so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory, where you can compare the characteristics of stars with rotational speeds.
Rebuls tells that the constellation Plejade helps to create theoretical models of rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the speed of the stars is slowing down and about the complete stop process.
Rebuls and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the rotational speeds of the Plejade stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
