When an English speaker notices that a foreigner with whom he is talking does not understand something from what he is saying, he repeats exactly the same thing, but louder, as if this person were deaf. At no point does it come to his mind that the choice of his words could be difficult, or that his expression could be easily misunderstood by the foreigner, and that he could also say it more simply with other words. As a result, a person does not only understand what he is said
