MG Baltic case: Gustainis’ new lawyer says he hasn’t gotten acquainted with the case file yet
All the defendants, including <0xC5><0xA0>ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Vytautas Gab<0xC5><0xA1>ys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis, gathered for the 11th court hearing of the MG Baltic case on Monday.
The trial began with the testimony of the defendants.
At the last court hearing, the newly appointed lawyer of <0xC5><0xA0>ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Gustainis, Aleksandras Doro<0xC5><0xA1>evas, told the court that he had not yet got acquainted with the case materials.
Linas Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, attorney-at-law of MG Baltic, then stated that in order to ensure a full-fledged defence of the person, the panel of judges must allow the new lawyer to get acquainted with the case materials and requested that the hearing be postponed.
"In order to ensure a person's defence, he must familiarize himself with the material of the criminal case.
It's not just a formal sitting," Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said.
The new lawyer, A. Doro<0xC5><0xA1>ev, noted that he had not been able to familiarize himself with the indictment or with the entire case file.
At a previous court hearing, the suspect, <0xC5><0xA0>ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Gustainis, said he had refused to give up his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
Audio recordings were also listened to at the meeting.
The defendants’ lawyers complained that the audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, by taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions in favour of the group in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as exerted influence in determining the winners of public procurements, ELTA recalls.
More than 150 people were interviewed during the pre-trial investigation, more than 50 of whom were members of the previous and current term of the Seimas, several former ministers, and members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 interrogations and more than 30 searches were carried out.
Gustainis is suspected of receiving a bribe of more than 8,000 euros, Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius of 15,000 euros and Gap<0xC5><0xA1>ys of more than 27,000 euros. Masiulis is suspected of having taken a bribe of more than 106,000 euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade in influence, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade in influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade in influence.
It is suspected that politicians discussed bribes with the vice-president of MG Baltic concern R. Kurlianskis and later offered or supported initiatives in favour of the concern in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethical Guardians: The Liberal Movement's Board of Directors is Right About the Deed of the Vilnius Division
"Decisions taken by the board are in accordance with the statutes," its head Vytautas Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas told BNS after the commission meeting.
“This decision was not new.
We already had an explanation as a commission in July, when the issue of Pagegiai and Utena was raised.
We then said that, according to the statutes, this is a matter for the board.
And if the board decides that any division may do as it pleases - go with the committee and the board approves it, then the division may go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has accepted, then it is the decision that all divisions should form party lists.
And if you don't agree with the board, then there's a possibility to suspend membership and go to the committee," he added.
According to Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas, the party board will now decide on further actions.
On October 17, the Board of the Liberal Movement canceled the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections not with the party's list, but with a newly formed election committee.
In the opinion of the party’s board, the decision of the capital’s liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party’s statutes and decisions of the board.
By October 31, the Vilnius branch had to cancel its aspirations to participate in municipal elections with a list of the committee.
The department didn’t do that.
The former head of the department, parliamentarian Au<0xC5><0xA1>rin<0xC4><0x97> Armonait<0xC4><0x97>, has already withdrawn from the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, former chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus <0xC5><0xA0>ima<0xC5><0xA1>ius, who is promising to seek another term as head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, we are proud of!".
He also left the party.
Elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place in March next year.
Residents in a rural village in northern India ran over a tiger in a tractor that had killed a man before, officials said Monday.
Forest guard Mahavir Kaujlagi said that after a man who worked in the fields was torn by Tiger late Sunday, villagers surrounded the animal and drove her over in a tractor as she tried to escape.
Residents say the tiger attacked and beheaded a young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kheri District, about 250 km southeast of the Uttar Pradesh state capital, Laknau.
It is prohibited to galabyte tigers in protected areas.
Ramesh Pandey, director of the sanctuary, said the case would be reported to police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, villagers in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh state beat another tiger, who suffered serious injuries.
Tiger is the national animal of India; under the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Last year's government figures showed at least one person died each day in clashes with wild tigers or elephants in the previous three years.
Human conflicts with tigers have been on the rise since the 1970s, when India launched a tiger conservation program that established reserves in national parks and made the killing of big cats a crime.
While tiger counting techniques have evolved, censuses suggest that the population of the then estimated 1,800 tigers rose to 2,226 in 2014.
Compulsory microchip labelling for dogs and cats
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Chairman of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection proposing mandatory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
“We propose that the labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips should be mandatory and that registration and labelling should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked with state funds free of charge, and in 2020, cats will also be marked, so residents will not have any concerns and the costs will be covered by specially allocated state funding," said K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systematic need for marking of domestic animals.
It is hoped that this will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible pet breeders, illegal multipliers or sellers.
It is estimated that according to the expected average price of the microchip and the service, which will be around 5 euros, all pet owners will be compensated during the transition period.
The total cost of labelling all pets can reach up to 6 million euros.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will reach 2 million euros per year.
It is expected that the funds for the labelling programmes will be allocated through the Special Municipal Environmental Protection Support Programme, the revenue of which will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for marking cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to K. Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, the practice of mandatory labelling is common in almost all countries of the European Union, which allows to protect the animals themselves (because the lost can easily be returned to the owners), and saves the time of the pet breeders themselves, when they have to spend a lot of time and money on the search for an escaped and lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation stipulates that only marked pets are allowed to travel.
At the same time, the label obliges to take care of the animal responsibly throughout its life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling were met with opposition because the relevant programmes were offered for funding by the population.
"The current model should avoid this criticism, because it is proposed to finance animal protection with increased income in the environmental protection support program and to grant the right to label not only to veterinarians, but also to public servants, i.e. persons in animal care institutions who have attended special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the project authors said.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different parliamentary factions - K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
The provincial governor's spokesman, Arif Noori, said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four more soldiers were wounded in an attack on a joint army and police control post in the Khogyani district.
Noori said six fighters were killed in a three-hour battle with Afghan forces and ten Taliban were wounded.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement claiming responsibility for Monday's attack in Ghazni province.
Noori said the post was set up two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
During the attack, the post was completely destroyed.
"Morning" extended a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of FIBA European Cup will take place in Vilnius Rytas Arena, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
The match will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius Rytas, who maintains warm relations with Ukrainian basketball, will host Cherkasy Cherkaski Mavpy and Pristina KB Prishtina teams under its roof at the Rytas Arena on November 7.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine we were not able to hold this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us," Ukrainian head coach Maxim Michelson thanked "Tomorrow".
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always get along well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the countries with the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope to get support from the locals.
The Kosovo team was unable to enter Ukraine because the countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team takes third place after the first round with one win in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in the second position and has more wins.
This is going to be an important part of the group, as only two teams will go to the next stage.
In the past, the Ukraine and Kosovo national teams played in Vilnius for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
The 100-61 victory was won by the Ukrainian team.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the match free of charge on Wednesday, and the start of the match will be at 7 p.m.
"Women Lie Better" star actress Ben Arsobaite is haunted by liars
It’s probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobait<0xC4><0x97> has already received several roles related to liars.
At first, the series "Women lie better", then the performance "Liars" and finally the comedy "Liars".
In this film, Brigita plays the passing wife of Dainius Kazlauskas.
"I really enjoyed filming The Liars because I'm more of a theater actress and I rarely go to the movies.
The excellent team of colleagues from the very beginning promised an excellent result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was the dog Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would definitely be big and serious.
I've never been fascinated by these little, decorative "fifs" four-legged.
But during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that the affection became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the hostess, but without success."
From the very first minutes, a new Lithuanian comedy "The Lies" begins to appear in the comical and intriguing peripetiums of family members. It was produced by the producer of Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Among us, boys..." Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionovas.
Your lover just told you she's pregnant.
That would be great news, but... your sweetheart is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Before the announcement of the "good news" to everyone, parents suddenly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this happens just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - Christmas!
But the ending will be even more surprising, because no one expected such an outcome.
All heroes are not what they seem at first glance.
In addition to B. Arsobait<0xC4><0x97>'s comedy "The Liars", good mood will be presented to the audience by four generations of film stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita U<0xC5><0xBE>ait<0xC4><0x97>, Giedr<0xC4><0x97> Giedraityt<0xC4><0x97>, Lubomiras Laucevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Larisa Kalpokait<0xC4><0x97> and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedy "Liars" - in cinemas from November 9th.
Deciding whether to write off <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million in unpaid taxes
The Seimas on Tuesday adopted an amendment to the Law on the Declaration of the Place of Residence drafted by Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, the leader of "Farmers".
There were 56 votes in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
The Seimas will proceed with the consideration of the amendments on or after December 6, upon receipt of the Government's conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the MP, in three years one person does not pay about 1,000 euros, and now there are about 100,000 such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would "urge some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Conservative member of the Health Affairs Committee Antanas Matulas noted that Lithuanians living abroad are taking advantage of the fact that they come to Lithuania for medical treatment by paying a small health insurance fee and receive the same services as the residents who pay this fee.
The amendments provide that those persons who will pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation will be considered to have left Lithuania, while Sodra will exempt them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, the head of Sodra, has said earlier that such a move will make both the lives of emigrants and the activities of Sodra easier.
An online video of a teddy bear reveals a serious problem
Foiled as a mother bear climbs a steep snowy slope, the little one keeps climbing, slipping down, and climbing stubbornly again.
The video received a lot of reviews and comments.
People admired the perseverance of the little bear - having slipped down many times, he would climb up to his mother again.
He does not succeed the first time, but the little one does not even try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video has certainly attracted attention, but it also reveals the dangers that humans pose to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to learn about wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
"It is clear to me that the bear drone was very frightening.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If the drone had not flown around, they would probably have chosen a safer route, or they would have overcome it more slowly or cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Ditmer and his colleagues studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were given heart rate monitors.
When the drone approached, some of the bears would run, others would not, but their hearts would beat more often in fear.
Scientists advise to use drones to film animals responsibly, not to fly too close, not to make noise and not to fly where it is forbidden.
The president was contacted through the newspaper.
A Kiev court on Tuesday summoned the exiled Russian president Viktor Yanukovych to appear in an unusual manner in a court case over his alleged treason, announcing the summons in the official gazette.
The summons, published in the government's Uriadovoj Kurjer newspaper, invites the former leader to attend the November 19 hearing of the criminal proceedings, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Yanukovych has the right to take part in the hearing by video link.
On October 30, the Kiev court said it had closed the debate on Yanukovych's case.
Yanukovych's lawyer, Alexander Goroshinsky, who works in Russia, was given until November 19 the opportunity to register with the register of foreign lawyers so that he could attend the hearing, where Yanukovych is expected to have his last word by video link.
Yanukovych was overthrown by the Kremlin and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, triggered by his refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was taken to Russia in a special operation organised by Moscow.
Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in March that year, and a war broke out in the east of the country between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
The fighting has claimed some 10,000 lives since then, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunskas will lead the list of Conservatives to Vilnius City Council
Former Economy Minister Dainius Kreivys was approved as the Conservative candidate for the year.
Over the weekend, during the Conservative primary elections, party members ranked the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Municipal Council.
According to the party, V. Benkunskas, the chairman of the Vilnius branch meeting of the TS-LKD, became the leader of the conservative list.
Members of Vilnius City Municipality Council Paul<0xC4><0x97> Kuzmickien<0xC4><0x97>, Adomas Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas, Gediminas <0xC5><0xA0>vilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Ba<0xC5><0xA1>kien<0xC4><0x97>, former member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the League of Young Conservatives Mantas Benkunskas, Ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Valinskas and Honorary Karazijait<0xC4><0x97> were among the top ten candidates.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on March 3 next year.
Restrictions on Cogeneration Plants Appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition to the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court against the decision of the ruling parties to pass a law on the possibility of halting the construction of waste incinerators.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of members of the Seimas had asked the Constitutional Court to investigate the constitutionality of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the ruling parties.
"Parliament stresses that the provisions of the law are intended to question the current projects of waste incinerators by instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km from the residential area) before the entry into force of the law on the construction of incinerators started in Vilnius and Kaunas," the report said.
"Parliaments note that, taking into account the way the prohibition on the construction of waste management facilities of national importance is formulated in the law (i.e., the distance is determined and the concept of "residential territory" is defined), it must be concluded that this prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the very essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production in the territory, because the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, considering the density and distribution of Lithuania, it is impossible.
The petition alleges that the law violates the constitutional principle of a state under the rule of law.
"The Constitutional Court has repeatedly indicated that legal acts do not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted legal act.
In this case, the Government has the power to apply the law retroactively on the basis of an indeterminate criterion.
Having established such legal regulation, the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of a state under the rule of law have been violated," the petition states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power plants.
Stopping the projects currently underway would cause not only hundreds of millions of financial losses to the state, but also huge losses to the residents of Lithuania: heating prices would increase and environmental pollution would increase due to the increasing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
The appeal was signed by the members of the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic Groups and the Deputy Chair of the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group Algirdas Butkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to gather 71 votes to reject the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>'s veto, which enshrine the government's right to halt the construction of cogeneration plants already started, as well as to establish a "quarantine" zone 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such plants.
The amendments to the law adopted repeatedly by the Seimas will come into force on 1 January 2019. True, the ruling parties already propose to abolish the 20-km limit.
This proposal is planned to be discussed in the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government’s right to suspend projects that have already started is not planned.
The court will examine the case in order, no sooner than a year later.
LeBron James statistic at Lakers
The start of LeBron James' career at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he expected, the organization and basketball fans.
The Lakers started the season with four victories and six defeats, and such a weak start helped spark rumours of the possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, these talks were reassured by the president of basketball operations Magic Johnson, who said he would not forgive the coach, but he needed to play better.
The biggest star of the team, L. James, should turn to himself.
Although the striker's stats are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
But she does not tell the whole truth.
In the first ten games of the season, there were other numbers showing that the Lakers were playing better when James wasn't on the pitch.
A +/- statistic that shows how many points a team misses or scores when there are certain players on the field.
That's when James is on the pitch, the Lakers missed 30 points more this season than their rivals.
As he sat on the bench, the Lakers scored 19 points more than their rivals.
The Lakers are currently in 13th place in the Western Conference, but a few wins could turn things upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
At the meeting, it was noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania highly appreciates Spain's cooperation in NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region," Minister Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already conducted NATO Air Policing and Air Policing Enhancement Missions in the Baltic States five times, including three times in Lithuania.
The last time Spain's Eurofighter jets were deployed in <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai in May-August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations are taking place between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication issues in the fight against propaganda.
Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius expressed hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to cooperate closely in addressing the European and transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius in 2004, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is Spain’s fifth representative in Lithuania.
On 29 October, José Maria Robles Fraga presented his letters of credence to President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> on the arrest of R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as: I believe in man’s innocence and law enforcement
For me, it was the most unexpected thing I could never have thought of.
On the other hand, they probably do the work they need to do.
We all do our own work.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is fair and honest, that no dishonest actions should be taken by him," she told BNS.
R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still being the director of Raseiniai municipality administration, took a high-value bribe and in return could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the municipality's Raseiniai bus fleet.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as or participating in the disguise of bribes in various financial transactions.
Raseiniai district municipal council dismissed R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as from the post of the head of the administration in April of this year on the basis of the third attempt after the expressed mistrust.
The former "ruler" became a member of the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas in March of this year, and he suspended his membership of the party on Monday.
R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as a few years ago, he unsuccessfully ran as a representative of the election committee "Your Raseiniai".
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> says that the man did not intend to run for mayor of Raseiniai next year, but has not yet decided whether he will participate in municipal council elections.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> was elected to the Seimas with the list of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she will wait for further law enforcement action, which will depend on whether she withdraws from the commission.
“I’m not making any quick decisions today, I think I’m going to make a decision this week.
I will see, if there is a need, what the accusations are, of course, I will make one decision or another.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but once again, time will put everything in its place," she said.
The representative of the opposition conservatives in the Seimas, Radvil<0xC4><0x97> Mork<0xC5><0xAB>nait<0xC4><0x97>-Mikul<0xC4><0x97>nien<0xC4><0x97>, urged the Speaker of the Seimas, Viktoras Pranckietis, and the head of the "Farmers" Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis to distance themselves from the statements of their parliamentary colleague Vida A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by transferring her to another committee or commission.
She claims that continued work by V.A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would create a lack of trust in society and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission".
Sensual "Coldplay" music also attracted famous Lithuanian couples
In the fall of Monday evening, many music and film lovers gathered for the pre-premiere of the film Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
The event was attended by a number of well-known people: Jonas and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of one of the most popular British pop rock bands Coldplay, which intertwines with moments from concerts.
Documentary director Matas Whitecross met the band’s men when they were still playing in bars and only had a few dozen spectators.
In the film, you can see still-unshown shots from behind the scenes of concerts, rehearsals or leisure.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in college in 1996 and formed the group Pectoralz.
Bassist Guy Berryman joined them soon after, and drummer Will Champion later.
The band changed their name to Coldplay, and exactly twenty years ago, they released their first record, Safety, featuring three tracks.
Of the 500 copies of the recording, most were distributed to radio stations, producers, and friends, and only 50 copies of Safety went on sale.
Now Coldplay is a world-renowned, respected and beloved band that has released seven albums, with more than 100 million copies sold.
The band has won 107 awards in two decades, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.

This legionnaire's performance allowed Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da residents to triumph over the local "Morning" 78:66.
The most common flu in one of the cities
The incidence of influenza and acute infections of the upper respiratory tract (ARI) decreased nationwide last week.
According to the data of the Center for Communicable Diseases and AIDS (ULAC), from October 29 to November 4, the total incidence rate of influenza and ARI in Lithuania was 49.9 cases per 10 thousand inhabitants.
Last week, the figure was 68.1 per 10,000 inhabitants.

Israelis killed in Palestinian knife attack in West Bank
The soldier "prevented the attack by identifying a terrorist who tried to strike civilians and an IDF (Israel Defence Force) officer," the Israeli army said in a statement about the incident outside Kirjat Arba settlement near Hebron.
"The soldier fired at the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
No Israeli civilians or IDF soldiers were injured," it added.
A military spokeswoman told AFP that a Palestinian tried to carry out the attack.
Video footage from the incident showed he was slightly injured.
A similar wave of Palestinian attacks began in 2015.
The number of such attacks has declined in recent years, but there are fears that a new wave could emerge.
On October 22, a Palestinian man was shot dead after attacking a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron.
Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> urges China to create more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for investments of the European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign import conditions.
Opening the Trade and Investment Forum at the China Import Expo in Shanghai, Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> stressed that in view of the signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world", targeting the root causes of trade war-related tensions, "overproduction and unfair competition".
"The European Union attaches great importance to China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open investment environment, which is important in the negotiations on a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> said.
China's opening up is important not only for Europe, but also for the country and for global economic growth, she said.
Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> underlined that investment transparency should be "above the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international agreements - this must be an essential element of the environment for new investment relations," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> said.
“Corrupt capital flows should not be welcome in any country in the world, not just here or in our countries,” she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to soften the criticism that it avoids opening its market and only protects its own companies.
Several heads of state, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania, are taking part in the exhibition.
According to the data of Statistics Lithuania, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuania’s exports to China grew by 50%, amounting to EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded 820 million euros.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investment in Lithuania could bring unwanted political influence, while Beijing's focus on Eastern Europe is dividing the EU's unity.

Causes of Lion Air plane crash revealed: relatives of the dead angry
LONDON (AFP) - The crashed Indonesian Lion Air's black box data shows a speedometer malfunction on at least its last four flights, investigators said Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSK), said a similar incident occurred during the plane's last four flights, including the fatal one when it crashed in the Java Sea on October 29 shortly after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed.
Many media outlets have reported problems with the Boeing 737 MAX 8's previous flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box, yes, in fact, the technical problem was speed in the air, in other words the speed of the plane," Tjahjono told a news conference.
"The black box data showed that the two flights before Denpasar-Jakarta also had the same problem," he added.
“There are a lot of rumors on social media.
We now want to clarify that there are four flights in the black box during which there were problems with the airspeed meter," he said.
During a meeting with the families of the dead, Tjahjono said the flight recorder corresponded to reports that the plane's speed and altitude had fluctuated in a disorderly manner since its last flight took off.
The search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air said the technical failure detected during the flight from Bali to Jakarta had been repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to Transport Minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated a meeting between family members and officials overseeing the search for the plane and the remains of the victims and the investigation into the crash.
But he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Kirana, who co-founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, introduce himself.
"The Lion Air acted inappropriately," said a man who described himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, a prosecutor on the island where the plane was headed.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
- Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air showed us no compassion.”
After this meeting, Kirana hurriedly left, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of identification of the dead.
Nearly 140 body bags loaded with human remains have been handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives have questioned why the plane was allowed to fly when it was launched two months ago, despite a breakdown on an October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, which also caused passengers to crash the plane in a terrifying crash shortly after takeoff.
Lion Air said the fault was rectified.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the appropriate technicians must be held accountable.
The law was very clear, and they did not say that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must be held accountable by law to prevent plane crashes in Indonesia from happening again.
Tjahjono said the large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris was spread over a relatively small area suggested the plane likely crashed into the water at very high speed.
"The plane was solid when it fell into the sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the plane's engines were running at high speeds when it touched the water, as all the turbine blades that crashed showed," the official said.
The Lion Air crash is Indonesia’s worst air disaster since 1997, when a Garuda plane crashed near Medan, killing 234 people.
Rescuers rescued from the wreckage after the accident: a minor was also injured
On Monday evening, on the road V<0xC4><0x97><0xC5><0xBE>ai<0xC4><0x8D>iai-Plung<0xC4><0x97>, cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz" collided near Tilvikiai.
Vehicles collided and three people were reported to have been injured.
The BMW driver, born in 1999, reportedly drove on the opposite side of the road and crashed into a Mercedes-Benz car carrying a father born in 1967 and a daughter born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters.
A girl from Mercedes-Benz was knocked out of her teeth in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
There is no need for artificial easing of the referendum
After the Seimas approved the proposal of the ruling parties to lower the threshold for the first section of the Constitution, which currently enjoys greater protection, the president will veto the amendments, her adviser Mindaugas Ling<0xC4><0x97> says. [...]
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the demand.
This and its modification, especially of the articles in its first section, should certainly be no less than a majority .
It is easy to predict that the president would really veto," Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>'s domestic policy adviser told <0xC5><0xBD>ini<0xC5><0xB3> Radijas radio on Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamentals of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, so reducing the number of votes necessary to change these articles, according to M. Ling<0xC4><0x97>, would create a "negative precedent" and "open up unmanageable risks".
"In the president's opinion, there is no need for any artificial easing, rather we need to prepare for the referendum itself, we need more dialogue with the people," he said.
The Seimas plans to vote on an amendment to the law on the referendum on Tuesday.
It shall provide that a decision on amendments to the First and Fourteenth Sections of the Constitution, which enjoy higher protection, shall be adopted if at least two-fifths of the citizens entitled to vote approve it during the referendum.
Currently, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote can amend articles of the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution by referendum.
About 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half of them would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths would be one million voters.
The proposal came after the Seimas in September approved the president's veto on earlier amendments passed by parliament that softened the requirements for the number of votes to change Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution, which defines citizenship.
The referendum is expected to take place on May 12 and 26 next year, when the first and second rounds of presidential elections are planned.
Those who emigrated since independence on March 11, 1990, cannot currently hold dual citizenship, with some exceptions.
The world Lithuanian community is seeking dual citizenship, but it fears that under the current conditions the referendum will not take place - not enough people would come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "bra<0xC5><0xA1>ka", therefore they need to be updated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is starting to crack, therefore it needs to be updated, says Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is a minimum task that the state must perform.
“The air transport infrastructure is already crumbling, as it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - it is not even part of long-term planning, it is the minimum that we must do," Masiulis said at a transport conference organised by the Foundation for the Development of Democracy and the magazine "Valstyb<0xC4><0x97>".
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, as important projects will have to be implemented – construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, construction of Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da external port, renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of the external port in Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da, clean up the airports, and possibly decide on the construction of the new airport.
We must stay awake and start projects that will use our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years," said the Minister of Transport and Communications.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that too little money has been allocated to road maintenance in recent years.
“The situation is not improving because there is not enough money available.
We are planning to build new roads, but even basic maintenance, for example on highways, is underfunded.
We must determine the amount that should be allocated for road maintenance if we want their condition to improve," Masiulis said.
He emphasized that the export of services in the Lithuanian transport sector grew by 18.6% this year, and Germany became the largest export market, surpassing Russia.
Mr Masiulis again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers would be obliged to periodically return trucks to the country of registration.
“We need to make sure that our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, it is absurd to propose that trucks return home constantly, because empty lorries would be driving in Europe, burning fuel, increasing emissions.
The railways will gain the most, because the cost will increase to the extent that part of the transport will be transferred to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport, 12.2% of traffic is generated in the transport sector.
Lithuania's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It has more than 118,000 employees and more than 7,500 companies.
Disputes with heritage conservationists
Last week, Masiulis announced in the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building, which would allow to demolish the old terminal and build a new one.
However, Algimantas Degutis, the acting head of the Department of Cultural Heritage, called the deliberations of Masiulis political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1950s is a valuable that was entered in the register in 1993, and it is not politicians but specialists who have to decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of the image of Lithuania.
"To extract the old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step in order to demolish it and build a new modern arrivals terminal, so that when you arrive in Vilnius you would feel like in a modern country, rather than in such an interesting, not really representing our country as innovative," Masiulis said at the Seimas last week.
Masiulis also announced that he plans to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and connect the airport with Rail Baltica by building an underground station.
This transport node should be operational in 2026 after the completion of the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected 4.8 million passengers, and next year - 5 million.
Last year Kaunas Airport served 1.2 million passengers.
What are Lithuanian troops doing in Afghanistan?
The NFL has given them their tasks.
In total, almost 50 Lithuanian soldiers are serving in Afghanistan.
Kabul.
The headquarters of Kabul International Airport in the Afghan capital hosts troops of the logistical element serving all Lithuanians deployed in the country, organising visits and rotations.
Two soldiers of the Lithuanian Special Operations Forces are also serving in the HQ, ensuring the interoperability of the NATO mission command and combat support with the "twitters" in Kandahar.
The NATO Resolute Support Headquarters is occupied by military police officers who oversee public order.
Lithuanian staff officers serve at the same headquarters.
They are responsible for intelligence, operations, planning and logistics.
Kandahar.
About 30 soldiers of the Lithuanian Special Operations Forces are serving in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
They train the local police special operations unit, where about 150 Afghans are serving.
Officers shall be trained by SOP soldiers at their own training sites or outside of them.

Direct flights from Vilnius to Madagascar will start next year
In spring next year, the largest regular-flying passenger plane Boeing 767 will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly travellers from Lithuania directly to the island of Be, which belongs to Madagascar, according to information from the travel operator Itaka Lietuva.
Blue Panorama passengers will be able to choose from 259 economy class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday destination will be accessible directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says that he is trying to offer new holiday destinations to tourists from Lithuania.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators have also prepared new holiday destinations for the 2019 summer season.
For example, "Novaturas" and "Itaka" will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
The Minister of Finance on the possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
“We always have to prepare for difficult times.
What I want to celebrate is that for the third year in a row we are accumulating reserves for the first time in the history of Lithuania.
But it is also a very important thing not to talk about illness," <0xC5><0xA0>apoka said during a visit to Brussels on Monday.
On Monday and Tuesday, Finance Minister and Vice-Minister Migl<0xC4><0x97> Tuskien<0xC4><0x97> is attending Eurogroup and EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) meetings in Brussels.
The Ecofin meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU's single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce some form of tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that an agreement be reached on how revenues generated from the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States should be taxed, as long as there is no global consensus.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the European Commission rejected Italy’s draft budget as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the Commission has taken advantage of this opportunity.
Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain were asked for more information.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union: the feasibility of a European Deposit Insurance Scheme and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial assistance programmes, however, it is considered that the ESM’s functions should be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.

Lithuanian working traditions and customs
Recently, it has been 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and ethnographer Balys Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as (1897-1972) in Sidariai, <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai County, then <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai Governorate.
Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the national revival, which breathes life, has called many people of Lithuania, including the brothers Bura<0xC4><0x8D>us - Bali, Jonas, Bronius - from the very depths of the village, to engage creatively in the nurturing, meaning and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as, who has been traveling around his homeland for more than 50 years with a camera in his hands, presented a wide and realistic view of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing layers of national culture and had a rare ability to realize the enduring value of his work.
In the photographs by Balis Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as, the landscape of Lithuania, the mounds, and our people, perpetuated in the environment of everyday life and celebrations, decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of the legacy of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>, dedicated to the description of national working customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The materials show not only the uniqueness and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the last century, despite two world wars and heavy occupation.
The manuscript of the book is full of descriptions of the works of the interwar period Samogitia, especially Kupi<0xC5><0xA1>k<0xC4><0x97>nai, <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai, Tel<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1>k<0xC4><0x97>s, as well as the inhabitants of Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitija and Dz<0xC5><0xAB>kija, their holidays and other traditions and customs written by Balis Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as.
Of the approximately 10,000 negatives that remain in museums and archives, more than 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs have been selected for the publication, grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture characteristic of Kupi<0xC5><0xA1>k<0xC4><0x97>nai, Dz<0xC5><0xAB>kiai, other districts of Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitija and <0xC5><0xBD>emaitija.

The couple's fate: died after just a few hours of marriage
In the southwestern US state of Texas, a couple who were married just hours earlier died in a helicopter crash.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his contemporary wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler were killed on Sunday shortly after midnight when a helicopter crashed into a hill 16 kilometres northwest of Yuvaldi and 129 kilometres west of San Antonio, local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
Surprisingly, the accident occurred after flying about 24 kilometers, exactly as the newlyweds were aged.
The pilot, 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.
The couple studied at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They got married on Saturday night at the Byler family ranch near Yuvaldi and flew off in a family-owned helicopter after the wedding.
The accident occurred when the helicopter flew about 30 miles.
The newlyweds were on their way to St. Antonio International Airport where they planned to board a plane for their honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the couple's final destination.
"It's a very rocky, rough terrain area, and that hill is about 120 to 150 meters high," Kennedy said.
Lawrence has been piloting the family's aircraft for years.
Kennedy said he was also piloting helicopters while serving in Vietnam.
The autopsy should reveal the pilot's physical condition and whether it could have been the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after takeoff.
His debris was smashed into a wide area on a rocky hillside, leaving the hull "dangerously hung", flight safety researcher Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) told a news conference on Monday.
Investigators are planning to remove the wreckage and then examine it thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the truck and truck to reach the site, he said.
The cause of the crash has not yet been determined, and the NTSB's preliminary report is expected to be published in two weeks.
Israeli PM calls entry into force of new sanctions on Iran 'historic day'
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told members of parliament of his Likud party, his office said.
"Today is the day that, under President Trump, the United States imposes extremely harsh sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions against Iran, in all the time that efforts to curb its aggression have begun," he said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would strike a "decisive" blow against Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, dubbed "the most severe sanctions ever" by Washington, came after Trump's controversial May decision to withdraw from the world powers' nuclear deal with Tehran.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran’s oil exports, which have fallen by about a million barrels a day since May, and cutting Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long opposed the Iran deal, saying it is too limited in scope and time.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has vowed not to allow it to establish itself militarily there.
Other parties to the Iran deal -- Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia -- oppose the U.S. decision, saying the deal has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The case of the death of a young motorcyclist
In the case of the death of a young motorcyclist in the town of North Vilnius, the court will hear the testimony of a witness.
The Vilnius Regional Court decided on Tuesday that one of the witnesses in the case will be questioned at another hearing on November 26 in order to clarify all the significant circumstances of the case.
There has already been an acquittal in this case, but the prosecutor’s office disagrees.
On August 22, Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car after 79-year-old Eduardas Osipova declared that the rider was driving at high speed in the city and committed a gross violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office asks the district court to set aside the district court's judgment and says Osipov is to blame for the accident, and the conclusions of the district court are unfounded.
An acquittal is also sought by the family lawyer of the deceased motorcyclist.
The accident occurred around 3 p.m. on August 11, 2015, when the car "<0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia" driven by E. Osipov from Lak<0xC5><0xAB>n<0xC5><0xB3> Street entered <0xC5><0xBD>irm<0xC5><0xAB>n<0xC5><0xB3> Street and collided with the main road motorcycle.
The prosecutor's office accused the man of violating the rules of the road, which provide for giving way, and caused a traffic accident - a man on the main road of the motorcycle "Piaggo" died.
Initial police reports said the scooter driver was killed, but investigations later found that the vehicle was comparable in power to a motorcycle.
Vilnius District Court judge Rolandas Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas told BNS that experts had determined that the motorcycle driver was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the speed limit at the site was 50 kilometres per hour.
"The driver of the car could not have predicted that the motorcycle would go at such a high speed," the judge said.
At the time, the driver of the old car claimed to have been driving at a speed of only five to six kilometres per hour.
When the motorcycle driver saw the obstacle, he tried to brake and fell off the vehicle before colliding with the Skoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes Osipov, who was driving from a side road to the main road, should have given way to the motorcyclist.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Wagner mercenaries killed in Syria
Five Syrian soldiers and six members of the Wagner military company were among the dead.
This is according to the source of the Novaya Gazeta in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Corps of the Syrian Armed Forces is stationed in the area, which is joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and “military mercenaries”.
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request for information about the fate of the Russians.
Former Belgian king to take paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as a child of a former monarch since 2013.
The 50-year-old claims her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a long affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies his fatherhood.
According to the RTBF station, he can go to the Supreme Court to oppose DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel, the ex-husband of Delphine’s mother, is neither biologically nor legally the artist’s father.
Delphine applied for the relevant study in order to be recognized as the daughter of "real" father Albert.
The U.S. government will give money to the parties, but it will not give social workers anything.
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) plans to allocate a budget grant of nearly 3 million euros to the largest political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), which was established this spring and is headed by parliament vice-president Gediminas Kirkilas, has not yet been allocated funds from the budget.
However, they may be granted already in the near future by a separate decision of the CEC, if the legal environment regulating the allocation of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>aityt<0xC4><0x97>, the chairwoman of the Central Electoral Commission, informed the state news agency that "a meeting of the commission is planned this Thursday, in which it is planned to take a decision on the allocation of the budget half-yearly grant to the parties".
According to her, the CEC has until November 15 to make a decision on this matter.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, will receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.751 million.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million euros, the ruling Peasants and Greens Union - about 0.5 million euros, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about 0.5 million euros, the opposition Liberal Movement - almost 0.4 million euros, the Labour Party, which does not have a parliamentary group in the Seimas - about 0.23 million euros, the opposition Party, which has recently joined the ruling T
Under the current law, which will be followed by the CEC when distributing budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP, established only this spring, to expect to receive money from the budget.
The party has not participated in any election yet.
However, the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that the social workers will receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to three elections next year - the municipal elections, the presidential election and the European Parliament.
The relevant amendments to the laws on political parties and this year's budget adopted by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>.
The Seimas has not yet decided on the veto, but representatives of the ruling party, Kirkilas and the leader of the peasants-greens Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, insist that MPs will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, it will not be possible to do this before the meeting of the Central Electoral Commission on Thursday, therefore, according to Ms Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>aityt<0xC4><0x97>, "grants will be allocated according to the legal order that has existed until now".
However, the head of the Central Electoral Commission did not rule out that if the Seimas this week or next week rejects the president's veto and new amendments on the allocation of budget funds to the parties come into force, the commission may consider a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"When making a decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are an executive body that has to implement the laws that are being adopted," she said.
Should the Seimas be able to reject the veto and the new laws come into force, the Government would allocate additional money to the parties by borrowing additional amounts.
The grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Poroshenko says murderers of activist Handziuk should be punished
"I want to state that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be inspected very carefully in accordance with the examination procedures.
As president, I have no access to, and no obligation to, information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to find out the truth and punish evil," Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in finding out Handziuk's murder and that the killers, organizers and principals "take the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been reclassified as murder, they are at risk of life imprisonment, quite rightly and reasonably," he said.
He called the public’s demand for an open and impartial investigation of the case fair.
Poroshenko stressed that speeches by law enforcement authorities in parliament should show that "the government is determined to hold criminals and murderers to account, whoever they may be."
He also said that political speculation on the issue would not help clarify the situation, but would confuse everything even more.
"I call on all forces, both those supporting the government and the opposition, not to waste time on baseless arguments and, God forbid, not to use this murder for public relations," he said.
On the contrary, we now need to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - so as to inspire public confidence.
There is no other way for us.”
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the country," he said.
Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked and spilled with acid in the town of Kherson in July.
She was an advisor to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
She was hospitalized after the attack but died in hospital on Sunday.
After police and prosecutors failed to clarify the perpetrators of the attack, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko submitted his resignation on Tuesday.
After her death, government officials were accused by activists of failing to conduct a proper investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the attorney general and the interior minister.
"Today I am submitting my resignation," Lutsenko told MPs, reading his report on the investigation.
Parliament has yet to approve the prosecutor's resignation.
Lutsenko accused activists of exerting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the killing of Handziuk.
Bill Gates unveils toilet without water
With the introduction of a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from a traditional toilet to a waterless toilet with the computer revolution of the 1970s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates unveiled a high-tech toilet that doesn’t need water in plumbing pipes at an exhibition in Beijing, Reuters reported.
A toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of wastewater are processed into chemical fertilizers.
"The technology you see here is the greatest sanitation achievement of the past 200 years," Bill Gates was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
The tech toilet was created with the help of a charitable foundation founded by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
In seven years, the fund spent <0x24>200 million working on a facility that could turn human waste into fertilizer or water.
According to Bill Gates, there are about 20 toilets in the world.
The device is now finished and can be sold.
But for such toilets to be mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is willing to spend an additional <0x24>200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die each year as a result of poor sanitation.
Tackling poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, is increasing health spending, which is already <0x24>233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates to a toilet presentation in a jar with feces.
He said it was a good reminder that the small sample "could contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria that cause infectious diseases, 100,000 eggs of worm parasites."
S. Slyva elected president of the Mass Football Association
On November 5, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian Mass Football Association was held in Kaunas, where Sergej Slyva was elected as the new president of the organization.
Due to the request of Anatoly Stetsenko to resign from the office of the president of the Association, an extraordinary general meeting of the members of the Association was convened.
There were 13 members out of 15.
The first item on the agenda was the election of a new president.
Two candidates participated in the elections - Sergey Slyva and Vaidotas Rastenis.
Eleven members of the association voted for S. Slyva, two members voted for V. Rastenis.
S. Slyva will end the term of office of A.Stechenko, which will last until January 2021.
Worrying in France: Deaths are a cause for concern
French health authorities on Monday announced a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide amid concerns over dozens of recent poisonings in the country's west.
The health agency ANSES said the decision to ban all products containing the pesticide was the result of a new safety check launched earlier this year, before at least three poisoning waves in the Isle of Man and the Loire department began in September.
As a result of these cases, the government has already suspended the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfectant chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, about 700 tonnes were used each year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, complained of sore eyes and throat and breathing problems in the region of Angers, which is home to many lettuce plants.
"These episodes confirm our decision but have not rushed it," Francoise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told the Ouest France newspaper on Monday.
One of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe, metam is considered a "probable human carcinogen" by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The pesticide, marketed under the names Vapam and Sectagon, is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is due.
"There was no choice but to remove him from the market, regardless of whether there were alternatives," Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties facing lettuce growers, farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to halt the use of metam in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
Near Nantes, the region produces more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of lettuce consumed in Europe each year.
There will be "much fewer lettuce, radishes and leeks" next season, Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes Producers Federation, told AFP after the government suspended the use of metam last month.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million invested in a shopping centre with a wheel in Tallinn
A new shopping centre T1 will be opened in the Estonian capital this weekend, in which the local real estate development company Pro Kapital Grupp has invested EUR 70 million.
The shopping centre will have a total area of 130,000 square meters, or 55,000 square meters of rented area, with 150 shopping or entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, the developer said in a statement.
In comparison, the total area of Vilnius "Akropolis" (calculated together with the area for offices) is about 110,000 sq. m.
The T1 is the first supermarket with a roof-mounted observation wheel, according to the developer.
It will be operational at the beginning of next year.
In addition, the international transport gateway will be integrated into the area: trams will stop nearby, intercity buses will soon run.
The main terminal of Rail Baltica is also located nearby, and it is forecasted that it will serve 1 million passengers per year in 2026.
Paolo Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that the global supermarket business is undergoing profound changes and that the development of the T1 has managed to take its lead.
“We have created a new generation of shopping malls that provide emotions and experiences that are not available online.
It is a place of attraction for people in the very center of the city, a traveler's gate, an impressive and worthy of attention to the visitor and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family," Michelozzi was quoted as saying in a press release.
Great attention to entertainment
According to the manager of the shopping centre, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltic States.
The total area of the object is 12,000 sq. m., or one fifth of the total rented area.
An exclusive highlight is the observation wheel installed on the roof.
It will lift guests to a height of 120 m above sea level - the tallest TV tower in Tallinn.
Under the observation wheel, on the fourth floor, there will be a trampoline park "Super Skypark", which will open the largest trampoline center in Europe and the first basketball and volleyball field in Estonia, the company said.
The SkyLAB Interactive Research and Discovery Center promises to take at least five to six hours for children.
The entertainment complex will also include a 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema screened in six halls, visitors will also be able to experience virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to visual effects and moving chairs according to the rhythm of the film, the feeling of reality will be enhanced by the effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as selected scents, smoke or fog in the cinema hall.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia's tourism revenue by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Exchange as well as the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group in Lithuania received EUR 1.8 million in sales revenue and incurred a loss of EUR 350,000, according to Pro Kapital Grupp’s financial report.
In 2016, the Lithuanian market received almost EUR 9 million in sales revenue and earned EUR 2.4 million in net profit.
The shopping centre T1 was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
In Cameroon, President Paul Biya has been sworn in for a seventh term.
At a ceremony overseen by parliament speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, Biya, 85, vowed to protect the West African state's "integrity and unity".
Africa’s oldest president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner of the October 7 election, winning 71 percent of the vote.
However, the election was marred by low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biya's inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the headmaster, were kidnapped at a presbyterian school in the northwestern region, where English-speaking separatists are campaigning for independence.
The majority of Cameroon’s 22 million inhabitants are French-speaking, with a fifth being English-speaking.
In 2016, Northwestern and neighbouring Southwestern provinces began demanding autonomy over alleged discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy.
In 2017, Biya's refusal to appease radicals declared an independent state, the "Ambassania Republic," and raised arms.
According to non-governmental organisations, separatist attacks and government retaliatory operations killed at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence, some across the border into Nigeria, but many are forced to live in undernourished forests.
In October, only 5 percent of voters in the Northwest region voted, compared to 15 percent in the Southwest province.
In both parts of the country, Biya won two-thirds of the vote.
Conservatives' primary election: errors caused by inexperience
"When there was a shortage of places, understand that the party organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities made their premises available, but there were not all polling booths because we could not buy them ourselves.
“Thanks to everyone who borrowed,” he said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not change substantially, and the violations themselves are not of a malignant nature.
“There were complaints.
Not all the people who participated in the election had experienced it, for them it was also news.
Thus, not all of our actions were in line with our order.
Therefore, it was necessary to warn the CRC that the principles we described would be followed.
These complaints, however, do not give grounds to doubt the results," Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas said.
According to the chairman of the Central Committee, there have been cases when ballot papers were not stamped, and after learning about it, ballot papers found in the ballot boxes without a stamp were cancelled.
There was a lack of space in some towns, but according to Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas, complaints and violations related to several dozen ballots.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it really does not make a fundamental difference in the election results," A. Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas explained.
The party’s turnout was 55 percent, while non-partisan turnout was 69 percent.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked for the commissions.
The results published on Sunday also remain unchanged - 79 percent of voters voted for the winner Ingrida <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97> (16418 votes), while Vygaudas U<0xC5><0xA1>ackas - 21 percent (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support I. <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97>’s candidacy in the presidential elections to be held next May.
Trump says he probably won't meet Putin in Paris
White House national security adviser John Bolton said Trump would meet with Putin in Paris this week to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.
But on his way to the final rallies before the midterm elections, Trump told reporters he was not sure if it would be a good opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," the US president said.
But he added that the two would see each other at the G20 summit and "probably meet many times" afterwards.
Trump is still trying to "reset" relations with Moscow despite allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas asks to annul the decision of VTEK
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas, former director general of Vilnius University Santaros Klinikos, is asking to annul the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (CEC), which acknowledged that transactions were not declared on time and thus violated the law.
Strupa's complaint was examined by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on November 26.
The petitioner is asking to annul the VTEK's decision of May 23, court representative Sigita Jacinevi<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> Baltaduon<0xC4><0x97> told BNS.
Strupas believes that gifts to relatives should not be declared, he says he understood the exception to the law.
In May, VTEK announced that the then-deposed director general of Santara Clinics K. Strupas and the head of the outpatient rehabilitation department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital Silvija Strupien<0xC4><0x97> had violated the provisions of the law regulating the declaration of private interests.
During the investigation, it was found that four transactions were declared not following the established deadlines: a loan was taken from the bank with the spouse in 2010, securities were purchased from the bank in 2017, a gift was given to the daughter in 2017 - an apartment, and in 1996 together with the spouse a loan was granted to a natural person and not recovered.
S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97> also declared these transactions by missing deadlines.
Persons who have violated the Law on the Coordination of Public and Private Interests in the Civil Service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law requires you to declare not only your own data, but also the data of your spouse.
The study was conducted on the basis of information from Info TV.
It was investigated whether K. Strupas and his wife, the head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97> had properly and timely declared their transactions.
Last year, Strupas donated a property worth 125,000 euros to his daughter, according to Info TV.
However, the former head of the Santara Clinic and his wife did not provide the above-mentioned data in their declarations of interest.
Strupas and at least a dozen others have made allegations in the corruption investigation: according to law enforcement, illegal financial rewards were demanded from companies for winning public purchases of computers and software in clinics, disguised as support.
In this way, Strupas is suspected of having consulted at least five times during public procurements in the field of information technology in Santara Clinics.
K. Strupas himself denies his guilt.
Prof. K. Strupas, suspected of corruption, was dismissed from the position of head of Santara Clinics in September.
According to the decision of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Lithuania and Vilnius University, the employment relationship with K. Strup<0xC5><0xB3> was terminated at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10, 2013.
Santara Clinics continue to be temporarily headed by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until the competition to elect a new Director General takes place, and it is expected to announce it later this year.
President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> extends congratulations to L. Gutauskas on his anniversary
According to the President, L. Gutauskas combines religious, historical and philosophical metaphors, eternal values into a whole of arts, and opens the thousand-year-old wisdom and memory of the nation.
His favourite and appreciated works – poetry, prose, children’s literature, paintings, book illustrations – testify to Gutauskas being an artist with a versatile talent.
In her congratulations on the anniversary, the President thanked the artist for significant works that enriched Lithuania and wished him inspiration, happiness and success.
Schools want to teach differently: fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in the curriculum are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which on Monday presented them at the forum "Change in the content of education: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania".
Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>, the Minister of Education and Science, said that over 30 million euros have been invested in updating the curriculum over the past ten years, but no results can be seen.
"According to the results of the PISA international student achievement survey, student achievements are below the OECD average," said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>.
OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted by the Ministry of Education and Science, said that Lithuania is too focused on providing knowledge rather than on practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in Lithuania, a lot of attention is paid to literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility of schoolchildren, but it is also necessary to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and empathy.
Vice-Minister of Education and Science Gra<0xC5><0xBE>vydas Kazakevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, presenting the changes in the curriculum of general education, said that the scope of the programmes to be renewed this school year will decrease, they will be more specific and the disciplines will be more closely linked to each other.
According to the Vice-Minister, the education of pupils will be more individualized, schools will become more independent – they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30 percent of their unique education content, the current system of student assessment will change to an accumulative score, and the competences of the student acquired in an informal way will gain more weight.
Decrease in standardized tests.
We promise that general education programs will be digital, convenient to use, linked with e-resources, a task bank.
The aim of the updating of the curriculum is to improve students’ achievements in the international PISA survey by at least 10%, reduce the gap between students’ achievements by one third, acquire modern competences at school, and be literate in various fields.
Lithuania plans to allocate 7.8 million euros from the European Union and the state budget to update the curriculum from May 2018.
It is planned that the project of general education programmes renewed in the academic year 2019-2020 will be tested in a part of schools, and from September 2021 they will be implemented in all schools.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry was criticised for the nearly 8 million euros worth of the project implemented by the Centre for the Development of Education aimed at updating the general programmes of primary, basic and secondary education.
It is planned to allocate 7.8 million euros for four years, and in early October the first 1,3 million euros worth of procurement was announced in search of developers of educational programs.
After experts criticized the purchase, it was suspended, and the Minister of Education and Science J. Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97> dismissed the director of the Education Development Centre Giedrius Vaidelis.
Exercises on how to respond to extreme flooding in Lithuania
Lithuania on Monday began a 10-day exercise to improve the authorities' response to extreme flooding.
According to the information provided by the Fire and Rescue Department (FGD), the exercise will examine how state institutions are prepared to work when a state-level emergency is declared in the country, for example, flooding: to eliminate its consequences, coordinate the search for, rescue and emergency eviction of people from flooded areas, organize their supply of drinking water, food, ensure the necessary energy supply and provide other measures for the protection of the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries and other institutions of the country, as well as members of emergency operations centres of 12 municipalities will take part in the exercise.
The preparatory phase of the exercise will take place on November 5-13, during which municipalities will take decisions on emergency management after receiving information from the Hydrometeorological Service about continuous precipitation and incipient flooding.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for November 14-15.
During the event, the State Emergency Operations Centre will be operating in the Department, while the Emergency Operations Centres of institutions will be operating in state and municipal institutions.
When the Government declares a state-level emergency due to the consequences of flooding, the Chief of Operations appointed by the Prime Minister will lead the emergency response, relief of its consequences, protection and rescue of residents and property.
Mindaugas Kanapickas, the deputy director of the PRT, says that the most important thing in the exercise is to check the readiness of institutions to perform the functions provided for in legal acts, to assess the possibilities to exchange information, to check how prepared to warn and inform residents, state and municipal institutions, agencies and enterprises about the impending disaster, and to "improve the emergency management skills of state institutions".
The exercise will also demonstrate the joint capabilities of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters-rescuers to pump large amounts of water from flooded areas.
In 2009 BaltFloodCombat module was established for this purpose.
Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuri Lutsenko resigns
Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko announced his resignation on Tuesday in a speech to the country's parliament due to the resonance caused by the death of the acid-filled anti-corruption fighter Katerina Gandziuk, Ukraine's Unian.net news agency reported.
Under Ukrainian law, a request for resignation must be submitted by the attorney general to the president of the country, who must submit it to the Verkhovna Rada for approval by a majority vote.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General Lucenko presented the progress and results of a law enforcement investigation into the murder of Gandziuk in the Verkhovna Rada.
In a speech to MPs, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that Gandziuk's death was being exploited for politicians' public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her hometown of Kherson, southern Ukraine.
On July 31, an unknown assailant, K. Gandziuk, splashed acid in the face outside her home.
On November 4, she died of her injuries in hospital.
Protesters at the Ukrainian Interior Ministry are demanding an answer on who killed Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix reported.
According to Lucenko, there are 12 persons in the law enforcement investigation possibly related to the order for the murder of Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study has been leaked to the media, which threatens the study's success.
According to the attorney general, the suspects received essential information due to the leak.
Lucenko added that she knew Gandziuk personally and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"So that no one has reason to say that someone is clinging to power, I want to state that I am submitting a resignation.
Today I will present it to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss it in Parliament," the Obozrevatel newspaper quoted Lucenko as saying in Rada.
Lucenko added that "you cannot allow a country to have a dual government where the law enforcement system is broken without any evidence, not even for the crimes that have been revealed."
Lucenko is seen as a close comrade of President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed prosecutor general on 12 May 2016 after protracted attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokina, suspected of covering up corruption by top officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy <0xC5><0xBD>. Vai<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas meets with Orlen Lietuva representatives
According to Aurelija Vernickait<0xC4><0x97>, adviser to the Minister of Energy, the meeting will focus on the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector currently below the cumulative trajectories set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs) at EU level, accounting for a 6% share of renewable energy in 2015.
The Commission estimates that progress towards the binding 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to a number of challenges, including the relatively high cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector comes mainly from biofuels (88%), while electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas has adopted a proposal to supplement the questions of corruption investigation with a petition from the Conservatives to the Constitutional Court
The Seimas on Tuesday approved such a proposal, which was registered by Agn<0xC4><0x97> <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97>, the "Farmer" leading the investigation into illegal influence on political processes.
There were 58 MPs in favour, 27 against and nine abstained.
Next, the draft will be discussed by the Seimas committees, which appointed the Committee on Legal Affairs headed by A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> as the main one.
Upon receipt of its conclusion, a vote will be taken on the adoption of the amendment to the resolution.
Currently, the Seimas Provisional Investigation Commission, which is conducting a new investigation of political corruption, has been instructed to investigate possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> proposed to extend this term, stating that "significant information about possible illegal influence and influence on political processes and state institutions appeared in the public space."
A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> describes in the draft “possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or when applying to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Chief Official Ethics Commission”.
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by the opposition conservatives.
The ruling "Farmers" found that the Conservatives in their appeal relied to a large extent on the arguments of private pension fund lawyers.
The leaders of the "Farmers" accuse the former comrade Povilas Urb<0xC5><0xA1>ys of influencing the Chief Official Ethics Commission (CEC).
According to them, the former chairman of the Seimas Committee on State Administration and Local Authorities could have instructed the members of the VTEK to dismiss Mindaugas Siauris, the former head of the Commission’s Prevention Division.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to investigate the possible illegal influence of interested persons or their groups, influence on the course of elections, formation of coalitions, work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, activities and financing of parties and public movements, legislative processes, election of state-owned enterprises, heads of public institutions, members of management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to ask what information law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to the competent authorities, how they have reacted to it.
Researchers are expected to report their findings by May 1 next year.
There will be an election campaign for the President of the European Parliament.
Of the 12 members of the Commission, seven are representatives of the "Farmers".
Its members were also two social workers, one “organizer”, a liberal and a representative of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania-Christian Families Union.
Conservatives and social democrats refused to participate in the commission's work.
The new investigation was initiated by Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union.
He said an investigation by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGK) at the last session on essentially the same issues showed that the investigation should continue.
German intelligence chief loses his job
Maassen, 55, further fuelled the controversy by saying that "radical left forces" in Merkel's coalition were to blame for his troubles.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as previously promised, but was forced to retire.
Last weekend, it became clear that at a meeting of representatives of Europe's domestic intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Maassen criticised Merkel's "naive" immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has long defended the spy chief, said at a news conference Monday that Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and had "disappointed" him.
Seehofer, himself under pressure from both the dispute and his party's poor performance in Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to retire Maassen.
Shark attacks intimidated the whole island - third person bite
The Queensland Ambulance Service said in a statement that the victim suffered "serious leg and wrist injuries" during the attack near Pentecost Island, off the coast of Queensland state.
The man was taken by helicopter to the hospital.
The island of Pentecost is the largest of the archipelago of the same name, attracting many diving and sailing lovers from all over the world.
Shark attacks in this region have been relatively rare so far.
On September 19, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbor and the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last time sharks were attacked in the archipelago was in 2010.
CEC has two new members - Visconti and Puksas
A. Puksa was nominated to the CEC by the Lithuanian Lawyers’ Association.
He will replace <0xC5><0xA0>altauskien<0xC4><0x97>, who has been delegated by the Law Society.
Lawyer E. Viskontas has been proposed to the CEC, taking into account the submission of the Order and Justice party.
This party does not have a representative in the CEC after Donatas Laurinavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius left it.
In a secret ballot, Puk<0xC5><0xA1>as' candidacy was backed by 74 MPs, 5 against and 6 abstained.

Plump Girls Breaking Stereotypes About Wedding Dresses
Chubby girl in a white puffy bride dress - mission (not) possible?
Can a white swan floating toward the altar be larger than S or M and still look attractive?
The participants of the plus-size reality show "Size (r) Evolution" will prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride does not really depend on the woman's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the girls in the project will shed tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the set.
“There are still some who think that bigger girls don’t get the attention or the look of guys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me for what I am, he does not require a figure that meets some standards from me," Aurika will speak in her wedding dress before the show.
The wedding dress is not light, in every sense, the garment is a complex construction, it contains a lot of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women believe that a coarser girl in a white dress will look even coarser and therefore less self-confident.
I can reassure you that a properly selected dress model really solves this "problem", - explained one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
In the project, R. Kalinkinas decides the fates of the girls together with the entire commission - Erika Vitulskiene, who opened a plus-size fashion house, Naglius Bierancas, a photographer and a social media star, and Laura Pauk<0xC5><0xA1>te, a TV producer.
“When it comes to deciding which girl to say goodbye to, there is a lot of quarrel between the jury members, because we all come from different spheres and we have different ideas about the winner of the show.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses was made even more difficult, and this - I can now reveal - that there were two newcomers who were certainly not inferior to the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense,” says Kalinkin.
Newbies - 23 years of scandalous behavior in one summer reality show famous Ieva and 31 years of exceptional beauty mother of two children Dovil<0xC4><0x97> - like other girls participated in the "Size (r) evolution" selection and got into the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo shoot of girls on the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were returned to the show by LNK viewers who voted for their favorites on the television portal.
Internationally acclaimed reality show of plump beauties is taking place in Lithuania already in the second week - here plus-size girls are competing for the name of the country's first plus-size star.
So far there are only eight of them left, and all of them are well aware that there can only be one winner.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "Size (r) Evolution" starts this Monday evening at 8:30 pm via LNK.
Elba is the sexiest man in the world
People magazine named this year’s sexiest man in the world.
It was made by the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although he says the news was unexpected, he was witty when he spoke of the new title.
I thought, "You can't!
Seriously?"
And then I looked at myself in the mirror and I thought, yes, I look sexy today, laughing, the actor shared.
Speaking frankly, Idris said that this title was a very pleasant feeling that smacked his ego.
The British star says he has often been harassed and bullied because, as he puts it, he was "very tall and clumsy."
The young actor did not appeal to his peers and became an object of bullying because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"As soon as I grew a mustache and muscles, I became the coolest guy in my neighborhood," smiles Idris.
When a man loses his pride on these screens, Elba works as a DJ at parties held in Spain, and especially in the bustling Ibiza.
In his spare time, he enjoys Thai boxing and has a touch of fashion, which he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor insists that family is the most important thing for him in the world, so he is planning a wedding with his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba became the 33rd sexiest man in the world by People magazine.
In 2017, the title went to Blake Shelton.
Man beaten to death in <0xC5><0xA0>irvintos district
On Monday evening, a man was beaten to death during a drink in <0xC5><0xA0>alki<0xC5><0xA1>k<0xC4><0x97>s village in <0xC5><0xA0>irvintos district.
According to the Vilnius County Police, at 9:16 p.m., a report was received that a man had beaten a neighbor during a drink.
Doctors confirmed the death of a man born in 1943.
The suspect, who was born in 1994, was found to be 2.53 percent drunk.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the incident.
Managers no longer need 20km to build incinerators
Vilnius cogeneration power plant is under construction, near Gari<0xC5><0xAB>nai market.
Managers are no longer seeking to keep 20 kilometres away from settlements when constructing waste-incineration plants.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, the head of the Environmental Protection Committee, registered an amendment to the Law on Waste Management in the Seimas on Monday, renouncing such a requirement.
According to Ms Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, the "Farmers" faction, which previously supported the provision on the distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika's amendment stipulates that from January 2019, waste incinerators could be built according to statutory environmental and public health protection requirements.
He admits that the amendments were prompted by the president's doubts about the ban.
"Considering the definition of the residential area, it is clear that it would be almost impossible to find a place where the above-mentioned objects could be built," the committee chairman said.
In October, the ruling majority opposed amendments to the president's veto, which tightened the construction of waste incinerators.
In addition to the ban on building waste-incineration plants closer than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provide for permission for the government to make decisions on the future of two power plants already under construction, taking into account public health interests.
The latter provision, Mr. Mazeika, does not propose an adjustment.
The power plant fuelled with waste and biofuel is being built in Vilnius by the energy group Lietuvos Energija and in Kaunas together with Fortum Heat Lietuva, a company of the Finnish energy concern Fortum.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da.
A possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
The leaders of Britain and Ireland on Monday discussed a possible compromise on the difficult Northern Ireland issue, which is stalling Brexit talks, Dublin said.
In a phone call, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered the possibility of revising the so-called backstop mechanism, which would allow leaving open the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the EU's Republic of Ireland.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has vowed to consider the proposal but has ruled out any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the agreement, the Irish government said in a statement.
In a conversation, May "has raised the possibility of reviewing the backstop mechanism," it said.
"Varadkar has made it clear that he is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review is not linked to a unilateral decision to terminate the backstop," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators have not found an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain leaves the single market and customs union next March.
Both sides agree on “backstop measures” to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a broader trade agreement is signed to ensure that no additional customs checks are carried out at the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied temporarily to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab wanted Britain to leave the backstop unilaterally in three months.
But Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support this".
"The three-month or limited-term backstops are not worth the paper they will be written on," he said.
London and Brussels have not confirmed a breakthrough in Brexit talks after a weekend announcement in Britain that a deal was within reach.
"I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done," May's spokesman said in London.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: "We are not there yet."
Nobel laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the internet era.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, and the Nobel Prize-winning writer Mario Vargas Llosa.
"We call on goodwill leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate through which citizens can make informed decisions," the group said in a statement.
They argue that the "global information and communication space" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion".
“People have the fundamental right to receive information that is freely collected, processed, and disseminated, based on the principles of commitment to truth, pluralism of views, and rational methods of fact-finding.”
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticizes "fake news" but regularly accuses him of distorting the facts.
World leaders are expected to take a stand on the issue when they meet at the Paris Peace Forum on November 11-13, the signatories said.
The declaration came within two months under the leadership of Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, the head of the Paris-based press freedom and rights group Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
Seimas approves higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved the amendments to the Law on Product Safety, which provide that fines for product safety violations should be increased.
The amendments were unanimously approved in the Chamber.
According to Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, speaking about the new project, it is welcome that the goals set are related to better protection of consumers of products.
It also adapts its provisions to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"In my opinion, the proposed legislation is better and more specifically distributed among all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further violations, because the subjects who have paid the fines continue to commit repeated violations," A. Vinkus said.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, and after the approval of the Government, the Economic Committee of the Seimas supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase fines for infringements, strengthen consumer protection, empower market surveillance authorities and create a clear framework for monitoring product safety requirements and their compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities, when carrying out state control of product safety, were not granted the right to enter the territory, buildings and premises of manufacturers and suppliers, to carry out inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry, the six-month time limit for imposing fines and warnings is too short to identify the violation, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
According to the Ministry, the penalties imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label a product and thus ensure its traceability, in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to identify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to enter the territory, buildings and premises of economic entities that manufacture and supply products to the market, and to carry out inspections when performing state product safety control.
It is planned to increase the fines for violations of the law.
A fine of between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (currently between EUR 144 and EUR 1448) would be imposed on a manufacturer, an importer or an authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and a distributor who has made them available on the market, a service provider who has provided or is providing dangerous services.
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing on the market and making available on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine from EUR 1 000 to EUR 5 000 (currently EUR 868 to EUR 4 344) will be imposed.
Failure to comply with the obligation to withdraw dangerous products from the market, to recall them from consumers and to destroy them would result in a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,500 (currently between 1,448 and 5,792).
If dangerous products harmed the health of the consumer, a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000 (currently between 1,448 and 1,1584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of a consumer, a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 6 500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 25 000 (currently <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 5 792 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria a fine of up to 25,000 euros is imposed for violation of product safety legislation (the minimum amount of the fine is not set), in Belgium - from 26 euros to 600,000 euros, in Romania - from 155 euros to 6,666 euros, in Bulgaria - from 125 euros to 7,500 euros.
10-year-old child raped by family member
What happened in Colombia shocked millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl raped by her older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby was born through caesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
They were under medical supervision for a while.
It still takes some time before the young mother and child will be released home.
"Based on the information I received from the police, the child became pregnant after being sexually abused by a family member, a brother," the director of the hospital where the birth was made told a foreign television station.
Police are investigating rape and violence against children.
Norwegian Armed Battalion Participates in NATO Exercises in Outermost and Hardest Areas
Troops from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital Oslo.
The exercise is part of NATO’s largest exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the troops from Norway's second battalion spent much of their time away from home in places like Afghanistan -- that is, in warm lands -- after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
But they are most proficient in warfare in the Arctic, and these skills are particularly useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, soldiers in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and harsh areas, have taken part in staged battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in the cold in the wild, but in a harsh climate, they have to carry a much larger weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers staying at the command post say they share their skills on how to survive and fight in such conditions with other NATO troops.
The troops said the exercise, which resembles real warfare as no other, would teach them how to be prepared in the event of a serious threat.
Premier League outsiders win their first win of the season
On Monday, the 11th round of the English Premier League ended.
The Huddersfield Town team won a crucial victory after 12 consecutive knockouts in all tournaments, which was the first successful night of the season.
Huddersfield Town and London's Fulham ended the hosts' win with a minimum score of 1:0 (1:0).
Defensive football drew the attention of the spectators, as both teams fought for three important points, and the winner of the game was not clear until the last minute.
Still, the hosts kept the lead and prevented Fulham from tearing out the draw.
In the 29th minute, Fosu-Mensah scored his only and winning goal.
It is worth noting that this was the first goal scored by Huddersfield Town at home this season.
Huddersfield Town ranked 18th in the league after the 11th round, with Fulham remaining the last 20th.
The Vice Mayor of Kaunas has no plans to return to politics
Former Kaunas Vice Mayor Povilas Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis, who left his job in the municipality and the "United Kaunas" organization in the presidential election due to support for Vygaudas U<0xC5><0xA1>ackas, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
“I’m going to focus on business.
I am a shareholder of several companies and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be happy to be able to devote more time to my family," Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis told BNS.
He also said he did not plan to take part in the next local elections.
Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis has not yet had a chance to talk to U<0xC5><0xA1>ackas after he lost the primary elections of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrida <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97> on Sunday.
“To be honest, we haven’t had time to discuss the results and future plans with him and the team in detail.
It is clear that after Vygaudas withdraws from the further election fight, this stage of my life is over," said P. Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas politics because of support for U<0xC5><0xA1>ackas, but regretted that "Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a true leader in the context of international relations".
Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis briefly worked as the deputy mayor of Kaunas in 2011 and later returned to this position after the successful elections for "United Kaunas" in 2015.
He is a shareholder of the private school Erudito Lyceum and several other companies.
Workers working in Kaunas Castle: what are they doing here?
When Kaunas residents noticed the workers working in Kaunas Castle, they hoped that the reconstruction works of the remaining tower were finally underway.
Gabrielius Su<0xC5><0xBE>ied<0xC4><0x97>lis, Director of Kaunas City Museum, assured the portal kauno.diena.lt that the south-western tower with a fragment of the defensive wall was undergoing works to change the protective roofing.
According to the interviewer, the canopies will be cans.
"In an emergency condition, the worn-out can cover posed a threat to those around it - people could fall and get injured - so it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so it was also damaging to the heritage," the museum director said.
Will these canopies be similar to those that were a few centuries ago?
"All works are coordinated with heritage and other institutions," he added, seeking to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time the practical side is important - canopies must protect valuables from moisture.
When working with heritage, a universal solution was chosen.
Before that, the elements of the Kaunas castle were covered with tin during the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value," the director of the Kaunas City Museum detailed.
The contract was signed on October 2.
It is planned that the works will not take more than three months from the signing of the contract.
"It is expected to be completed by the end of November," the director of the museum said.
According to him, the value of the works carried out is almost 24 thousand euros.
This amount, according to the interviewer, was included in this year's budget.
Works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company Statija.
According to the results of the research, Kaunas Castle may have appeared earlier.
US and South Korea resume naval exercises
A two-week naval exercise with some 500 soldiers will now take place in the southern city of Pohang, the defence ministry said.
The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea.
The two countries have been holding joint military manoeuvres for years, which Pyongyang has described as a "provocation" and "preparation for an invasion".
On Friday, North Korea threatened to restart its nuclear program unless Washington lifts economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
Such a change of course could be "seriously considered", the North's foreign ministry said.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a television interview that punitive measures would remain until Pyongyang gave up its nuclear weapons.
At the same time, he said he would meet North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.
Maxima expands in Bulgaria - Verslo <0xC5><0xBE>inios
Maxima Grup<0xC4><0x97>, the largest retailer in the Baltic States, is expanding in Bulgaria, where it manages the T-Market chain of stores.
Edvinas Volkas, CEO of Maxima Bulgaria, told the business publication Capital that the company will open two more stores by the end of this year and will have a total of 74 stores in the country.
Next year, according to E. Volk, another 7-10 stores are planned to open in Bulgaria.

It has a 24-hour "social area" where you can use the Internet for free, charge your smartphone, buy sandwiches, salads and other dishes.
According to Volk, 2018 will be the first year the company will end with a positive EBITDA.
Mr. Volk predicts that Maxima Bulgaria’s revenue will grow by 40% this year, to EUR 158.5 million.
Last year, the company generated revenue of EUR 113.3 million.
Maxima Group has been operating in Bulgaria since 2005.
Last year, the company was ranked among the 10 largest retail chains in the country for the first time.
Maxima Grup<0xC4><0x97>, which is controlled by Nerijus Numavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, is planning to invest around 200 million euros this year and next year, most of them in Poland, where Maxima acquired the Stokrotka retail chain.
The group operates Maxima retail chains and Barbora electronic food store in the Baltic States, Stokrotka and Aldik in Poland.

Eastern Europe Studies Center to Cooperate with Two Famous U.S. Brain Centers
According to Linas Kojala, EESC Head based in Vilnius, who has been working for 13 years, the integration into the US will allow the implementation of projects and make Lithuania’s voice more audible on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am glad that two large institutions see us as partners and look for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that there will be niches for their activities, because the topics of NATO, security, disinformation and development of the Eastern Partnership countries that we analyse are also priorities for them," Kojala said.
It is noted in the agreements that the EESC and US institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expertise and knowledge, and organise expert visits.
This should be especially useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
The FSA has been in operation since 1955 and brings together nearly a hundred top-level analysts.
In the latest global ranking of analytical centers compiled by the University of Pennsylvania, the FSA ranked seventh in its category.
At the same time, CEPA, whose analysts have been repeatedly invited to consult and work in the top US political institutions, ranks in the same category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to penetrate the US information space and encourage us to raise the quality bar," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be the help of partners in distributing the upcoming EESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among US decision makers and in the public space.
The Eastern Europe Studies Centre operates on the basis of implemented projects and is not supported by targeted grants.
The EESC partners with which joint initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseille
Two people were lightly injured in the collapse of two buildings in the southern French city of Marseille on Monday, the fire service said.
When buildings collapsed, debris swept into the street and dust clouds rose.
Dozens of firefighters worked at the site, some with trained dogs, near Marseille’s famous old harbor.
The local prefecture posted photos on Twitter showing a pile of debris and wooden beams, a huge gap in the area where the buildings stood, firefighters on the scene and vehicles covered in a thick layer of dust.
Officials said they were looking for people who might have found themselves beneath the rubble.
Marseille firefighters said on Twitter that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
An amateur video broadcast on BFM-TV showed clouds of dust on the street and sleeveless passers-by covering their mouths.
Photos taken by Google Street View before the incident showed that one of the collapsed buildings was five and the other was six storeys high.
One of these buildings was clearly in poor condition, with closed windows, with large cracks in the facade.
Marseille district mayor Sabine Bernasconi said one of the buildings was in poor condition and had been ordered to be evacuated.
But she could not rule out that the building may have been used by people who settled there on an arbitrary basis.
The prefecture of the region urged people to avoid the area and clear the way for rescue services.
Marseille district mayor Sabine Bernascon said the building was in poor condition and had been ordered to be evacuated.
Brexit poll: How many Britons want to leave the European Union
A new poll shows that a clear majority of the British population is in favour of the country remaining in the European Union.
According to a study commissioned by the Survation Institute for Channel 4, 54 percent of respondents were in favour of cancelling Brexit.

Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out a second referendum.
The Survation surveyed 20,000 people between October 20 and November 2.
Brexit is set to take place on May 29th next year.
London and Brussels are now trying to remove the last hurdles to allow the country to leave the EU in an orderly fashion.

Mexican Restaurant Helps Migrants Deported from the United States
More and more Mexicans are being deported back, and they struggle to adapt when they return.
“When I was deported, everything was taken away: the house, the car, the clothes.
They took away everything except one thing - my knowledge," says Victor Hugo Hernandez, director of the restaurant.
The restaurant board hopes that merging Mexican and U.S. cultures will promote a better understanding of each other.
Afghan Special Forces member shoots American instructor during training
North Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, Mayor Brent Taylor, 39, was on a year-long vacation to carry out his mission in Afghanistan.
He was a U.S. military intelligence officer, but had to return to serve as mayor in January.
Another US military official, whose name has not yet been released, was wounded in an attack that killed Taylor on Saturday.
Officials said Taylor died of infantry fire.
Major General Jefferson S. Burton, commander of the Utah National Guard, told reporters that Taylor had helped train and build the capacity of the Afghan National Army.
Utah media quoted NATO as saying Taylor was shot dead by one of the trained special forces and killed by Afghan forces.
Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His body is due to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday.
He had previously carried out two missions in Iraq, and this mission in Afghanistan was also his second.
Before he left for Afghanistan in January, Taylor told local media that he had been assigned to a team of advisers and instructors from a special forces battalion in the country.
Hundreds of North Ogden residents gathered on the streets of the city of 17,000 people to escort their mayor, who was accompanied by police along with his family.
Taylor became mayor of the city in 2013.
