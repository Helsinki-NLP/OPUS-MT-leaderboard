The Civil Rights Movement has issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People (NAACP) has issued warnings for colored people traveling to Missouri based on state discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Recommendation for the State of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents that are currently occurring throughout the state," the state said in a statement.
The NAACP said it took this step on the basis of current laws of the state of Missouri that make it difficult to defend racistly motivated acts in court, as well as as a result of the conduct of bodies active in criminal proceedings that disproportionately target minorities.
“There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by the police just because of their skin color, they are attacked or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
“We have the largest number of complaints to date.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the U.S. state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated accusations against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline while traveling across the state and was thrown into custody by police without charge of a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent statement by Missouri’s Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office, which states that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and associates of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared – they should carry money with them for possible bail payments or notify their relatives that they are going to travel to the state.”
According to the current FBI program, there were 100 cases of hateful behavior reported in Missouri in 2015, making the state the 16th-highest among all states.
A travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people based on violations of this law, which the ACLU says is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but lately advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family is not at peace even after 12 years!
Sally Anne Bowman was murdered.
A Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie in the restaurant where she worked, who stabbed her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana together, then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe watching the careful criminal work of searching the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted to assaulting a teenager in court, and his lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl dead lying on the street.
Three years later, he was convicted by the police.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had a fight on the fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"It even caught the attention of the taxi driver," he lied.
The girl, according to his statement, was supposed to defend herself, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stabb her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven a lie and blamed him.
After Dixie confessed, he talked about his craving for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with her ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie told police.
He said he felt the adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda said.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He has been injured four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people in freedom who dig up these graves.
"So our daughter's not there anymore," the Mirror's mother, Linda, told the deceased girl about the disappearance of the ash urn.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
“Czechs are neither prudish nor conservative,” says Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>, who runs the Intimity boutique in Prague.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic gadgets.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It started unobtrusively, about twelve years ago.
Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> and his friends went on a bike ride in Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bike, but also a box full of unusual looking vibrators.
"Various moles and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me about lunch.
His friend and one other partner decided to work with the German designer of erotic gadgets Fun Factory, which interested Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue a different profession, he replaced him.
Today, the boutique Intimity operates in Prague’s Benedictine Street, where it sells erotic accessories in the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't I?
These are also design objects.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
Come on, don't be such a puritan!
It was the Berlin-based Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that inspired the Intimity boutique.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic commerce than everyone here is used to.
No hidden exhibits, all done in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited more like in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka began to consider how to conceive of the Prague trade, where it should be and what its name should be.
The name Intimacy appealed to both of them.
“It’s related to intimacy, and it’s also, you might say, tender,” he says.
It was followed by the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, a variant won, which spread the store into a garden of delight and a bedroom led by a bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nov<0xC3><0xA1> from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, it didn’t feel perfect, because it wasn’t on the main street, but it did sit next to the name Intimity.
It's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one sees customers," says Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a business that would be different, with branded pretty goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of having entered such a trade at all.
When I walked into the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the streets were empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going to the erotica store.
Right at the door I was surprised by the clean elegance of the interior, which I know from boutiques with fashion.
Even if there is only a female waitress in the store, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, it does not mean that the male foot would not come here.
Most of the time, men come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't guess the right size, and they choose the bigger one," Martin smiles at the common mistake.
These are the prejudices, the clichés, that women need some great tools, and that's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses a superfluous vibrator.
In the same way, men prefer mostly black clothing, while women tend to tend to pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
From the expression on my face, it must be clear that I do not know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoral stimulator.
There is a teenage need to meditate with admiration of the serious tone with which the interpretation is given to me.
It's like she's not shy.
And he doesn't really understand.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
I didn’t think it would be so well received.
This is one of the last revolutionary novelties.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He made sure that women began to be more interested in the design of such products.
The second was the We-Vibe pair vibrator.
He completely eroded the taboo that some men can endure, and the fact that he sees competition in erotic aids.
“There are different variations,” he continues.
With one motor, with two motors, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
When a woman is in love, she can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multipurpose devices and buy classic vibrators, although they may only use it externally.
In Western Europe, especially with younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin said.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." The most sold is mainly a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn’t look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but rather like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experiences in use.
In Japan, however, it is completely different.
It amazes me.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot for erotic aids, I object.
"That's the internet reality," I'm told.
The everyday is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with being used by women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just to be interesting - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide, still makes up about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs aren't very smart.
On the contrary, we are a very friendly people.
Definitely unlike countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical client of the store ranges between 35 and 50 years and "already has some experience with both sexual life and some tools.
She will come up with something nice, higher quality, which would complement her partner life, or herself." Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka take care to make sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also do not want to go into specialties like bondage and latex, because we do not have space for it, and it is not explicitly suitable here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are the people who always had the guts to go to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like this would happen to them.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really cute.
This is also due to the selection of reputable brands represented.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The very first awarded was the sea horse mentioned "and it triggered a change throughout the industry.
It began to abandon cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with health-friendly, began to produce other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that behind the design of some stands the Czech Republic, namely the popular designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how many people buy the design things Whoop.de.doo from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Venus's balls from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She did a really huge amount of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Ann's story began as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced with us.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since it is not a large-scale production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than a large series.
I may go a little against the current, but it seems important to me to keep the development here in the Czech Republic.
It could easily happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna later describes to me the situation, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
There is no negative or negative attitude.
They say people are most embarrassed.
Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> currently has a vibrator on offer, on which you can have a personal message prepared, and this year she is also planning her own lubrication gel.
In the next year, there should be more vibrating eggs and other novelties.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the limits of what is right are.
Is there anything Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> wouldn't sell anymore?
It is very difficult to define.
What comes to one normal, to another may seem completely abnormal, so we rather define ourselves by the assortment of brand manufacturers.
None of them go to any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one final question: What was the craziest demand they got?
Just this week an e-mail came in which a lady asked for masturbation aids for her boyfriend with a birthing length of twenty-eight centimeters.
So we had to write to her that unfortunately we didn't have anything like that.
The question is, did any of us make a joke?" Martin looks at me suspiciously.
This also happens from time to time...
A wound for Karl Gott.
After two cancers of Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>dr<0xC3><0xBD> is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gott’s best friend struggles with a disease that steals people’s memories.
"Yes, it's sadly true," said the singer himself, confirming the sad news to Blesk.
I am aware of my illness and, given the circumstances, I am quite able to cope with it.
"I'm taking medications that have accompanying symptoms of the disease to slow down," he added, adding that he thanked his loved ones for their support.
The whole family came together to make Karl's life easier.
Eva's wife is trying to be home as much as possible, and the daughters of the first marriage of Zuzana and Theresa, the older son of Charles called Karlas, also travel to the house on White Mountain to meet his father.
<0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>dr<0xC3><0xBD> fought cancer twice and passed on his experience to Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k to support him in his demanding treatment.
He's got 60 chemo treatments.
He was able to return to work after them also on the tennis court and on the ski slopes.
"I've been told by an astrologer that I'll be here by ninety," said Karel Blesku.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so that I don't forget them," said Karel.
Actress Kv<0xC4><0x9B>ta Fialov<0xC3><0xA1> is now battling the same disease at the institute.
Do you have a family member with Alzheimer’s?
Look at how you treat him.
Chile's parliament has lifted the ban on interruptions, the law will judge the U.S.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on artificial termination of pregnancy, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I'm sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we've been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende said in a statement.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has 10 members and should get a new president by the end of August, according to AFP close to the opposition.
The law repealing the absolute ban on interruptions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would be challenged in court because it violates the right of an unborn child to life.
MEPs postponed the bill last month until it is analysed by the Joint Parliamentary Committee.
On Wednesday, MEPs approved the proposal and the Senate did it again.
According to the new legislation, there should be no criminal artificial termination of pregnancy in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy was caused by rape.
According to the Spanish newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, that is, even before women got the right to vote there in 1949.
An absolute ban on interruptions was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on interruptions.
Other countries are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, some 20 women are now behind bars, serving up to 30 years in prison for interrupting their pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, the case involved miscarriage, which the court called murder.
Is there anything sacred?
Trump's White House target is now the Statue of Liberty
A sure sign of regime change is the critique of statues.
Americans could talk about it as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key proponents of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was up to when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta, he set out with a symbolic axe at the Statue of Liberty on the subject of presidential proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants.
It's fair to say that Miller didn't attack the statue as such.
For this, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emma Lazarus was placed on the base, until 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller rebuked Acosta: “I don’t want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that shines a light on the whole world.
A poem that has been placed on the base, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is actually right, but as he himself said, this isn't about history.
These are, above all, the striking words of the Emmy Lazarus, which resonate with today's times - it invites not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let those who fall come to me, who are poor, who can breathe freely, who are poor worms in the midst of full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these “poor worms” on our screens.
Miller didn’t try to criticize poetry — he wanted to make it clear that these people aren’t welcome in the U.S.
This conflict about the significance of the statue is part of an extensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the significance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to put a plaque with a poem on the base of a statue, knew well enough that she was getting into a high political game.
The statue was to express the connection of the French and American Republican governments by representing the classic theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has her own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
Merging the poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wing adherents have long tried to pervert that meaning.
Famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jan Baptizer on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone into the country, but represents early neoconstructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is stepping forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States.”
Limbaugh is curiously pointing to an important thing.
The significance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus depicts a statue from the point of view of an exhausted and cursed traveler, who often arrives to a new land with hope in his heart after a long and frightening voyage across the ocean.
It is literally a look at the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this perspective, he expresses the statue of hope and listens to their needs.
This is a view that neither Trump nor Miller will accept.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to inflame hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish team members
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
UK athletics federation director Neil Black said a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be "a huge benefit to the team".
For the 2017 World Championships in London, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes has been selected.
Black believes that “something special is happening” in Scotland, and British athletics could learn from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we're going to work on it," Black said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
Scottish athletics leaders think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it’s absolutely amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected team captain.
“She is humble.
Her introductory speech was amazing," Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and unhidden feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400-meter hurdles at her fifth World Championship, said it was "unbelievable" that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the team.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The middle-distance runner Muir set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
He will compete in the 1500 m and 5000 m races.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500 m track. This season he won the British team races and the Annual Games.
Doyle remembers her first championship, at which she was the only other Scottish member of the team Lee McConnell.
The team captain said she was "very proud" of the fact that not only did a large number of her colleagues join the team, but in many cases they would also attack to participate in the final and medals.
"The extraordinary thing about being captain of the team is that I was chosen by the other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but the knowledge that I was chosen by the team members is very satisfying," she added.
“I’m very proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
It proves where I've moved.
These are the athletes who will think about the front seats on the stage.
And my introductory speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's being held on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of home fans and rejoice at the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at the race and I’m going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t apply for public office if you can’t stand voter criticism
Our father knew his criticisms.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he did not try to silence the criticism.
Because in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away from us – and stupid and dumb we will be led like sheep to slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who freely voiced their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The Governor’s staff dismissed the lawsuit as unfounded, and many “who cares” views appeared on the internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” many users said.
Still, that's what matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second-highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not inspiring.
As you can see, he runs his state with his own confidence and strictly adheres to the principles.
He also turned out to be adept at using Facebook as the main means of connecting with his constituents – the exception being the publication of the first photo with a bare head after completing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's site - which is a public forum, designated as official and managed by his employees paid from taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor by saying that the blocking of comments took place from the position of moderating posts.
However, using the image of internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post confessed to several real people to whom the posts were deleted.
And that's exactly what they are -- real people talking to their elected leaders; a teacher, a businessman, and a pastor, no trolls.
As everyone pointed out, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi’s lawyer Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
“I politely noted that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other current news,” she wrote in the comments section of the Washington Post.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are labeled as promoting the so-called collective effort, rather than being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor’s staff called “concentrated spam interest” others would probably call “defense.”
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all the prints with criticism, or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that’s exactly what’s happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media outlets.
President Trump faces a lawsuit from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
Loudoun County Board of Supervisors has violated District Judge James C. Cacherise’s first amendment in Alexandria, where she barred one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
In Washington’s time, the low cost of postage had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and many anonymous writers questioned his position as leader.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to the newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people as part of the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions piled up in his office criticizing his views on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
The Czechs quickly took advantage of free roaming, they consume more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than they do at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On the one hand, they have more time to browse on the web, under the umbrella in addition, they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and a smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at home prices.
This is according to O2’s latest statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available as part of the package than at home.
Therefore, it is not surprising that in Croatia, where the minimum number of pilgrims travel during the winter, the consumption of data has increased by fifty times this summer.
In the second place in the ranking of consumed data, Italy was then placed.
The Czechs will call the most minutes from Germany, where many of them go to work and during the summer.
According to data from the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia is visited annually by 800,000 Czechs, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year’s record was July 7.
"Tens of millions of photos would fit into the transferred data," said Silvia Cieslarov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the mobile segment at O2.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users moves in neighbouring countries.
First place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, on which we do not have so much time to browse on the Internet.
"Across Austria, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While for data, the operator recorded high year-on-year growth after the release of roaming charges, for telephony, the growth is much lower.
The number of minutes spent roaming has doubled from last year.
With a huge lead over other countries, Germany dominates here.
“Roaming calls are more used by corporate customers on business trips,” Cieslarov<0xC3><0xA1> added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Former golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian, Scotland, hosting the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, succumbed to Paul Eales last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals. This year he will serve as the tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow in front of my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an avid defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
Eales will defend the title for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It is a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when winning was a big deal for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a beautiful time that I won’t forget.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years of the region this year, returns to his homeland.
This event will be his first participation from the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play at home," Orr said of Helensburgh.
“You want to be successful and you feel a lot of pressure.

Poverty and Death in the Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pelvis.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the local "note" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, remove the potato and taste it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof fills the toilet.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned any field for cultivation.
Polygamy is common here.
Working until late at night is a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, soldiers live in the village.
"In the afternoon after five o'clock, no one will be allowed to wander around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life on the Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by a public hand-raising in front of the occupying army.
The current anti-Dutch protest movement quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate city that you can get to after a ninety-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabira, and then a five-hour gastric constriction ride.
Public transport in this area does not work.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, indeed journalists, and practically no foreigners, looked at this place.
Before the arrival of the Christians, the locals worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing these dresses,” says Bardina, pointing to his colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt, and shiny skirt.
"We used to only carry leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and the child mortality and literacy rate is one of the worst in all of Asia.
At the same time, however, it is the country of gold in Indonesia.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of the American Phoeenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai – a rocky province roughly the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 residents.
In 2015, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports wood mining in an estimated value of $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation conducted in 2005 by the New York Times found that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
The Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely oppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the Papuan tribal area during the 1970s amounted to genocide, the Asian Commission on Human Rights said.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that took place last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture – according to another report, rape and electric current execution are particularly popular – and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan sources were attracting settlers to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% profess Christianity, but the demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
The locals are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the capital of Jayapura province.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mama-mama (women) - lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, pledged to address inequality and rights violations during his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta in 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua and the local people feel betrayed.
“Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would hear our call for justice,” You said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi’s October inauguration, Paniaia experienced a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang a Christmas song at a campfire in the city of Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles emerged from the heat of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by the sigh and tone with which it was pronounced and later returned with four other soldiers, local priest Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in the drunken state chased a group of children and beat them with their guns, reported victims and witnesses events.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby Electoral Commission building, and the next day things were getting worse.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and military headquarters and demanded justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a wait dance - in which a circle is run and the singing of birds is imitated - the Papuan tribe Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began to throw stones at the buildings.
With increasing tension, the soldiers were given an order via radio: “If the crowd tries at least three times to resist, you are allowed to shoot,” according to the weekly TIME in an official document, the content of which was never published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Enarotali district of Kego Koto, recognized the dangers and urged residents to move to their homes.
But no one paid attention to his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
“There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting,” he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME in a dismayed voice.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
A Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers had only “secured” the station under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,” said Papuan police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The report of the murders was leaked to the Jakarta media the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his understanding of the families of the victims and vowing to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve violent acts that occurred in the past.
But almost immediately, excuses began to be heard.
“Most of the violence has been committed a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
However, in a June 5 interview for TIME, which took place in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said, “all cases will be brought before the court.”
Wiranto, who was accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" based on more than 1,000 deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have so far been settled, including the Pania incident.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claims with distrust.
“I’ve been asked four times in the last three years, but so far I haven’t seen anything,” Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai, who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me," he said.
The shooting has not stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The clash, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, occurred between the villagers and the manager of a construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at them and the answers were a warning shot.
However, locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"There was a panic, we were afraid of retaliation," 29-year-old Domingo Badia, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured, told TIME.
“I didn’t leave the house for two days.”
The Deiyais parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the central highlands.
Many of them have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of insurgents who protect the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks in recent years, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of residents of Paniai, all under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty".
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as a “tragic and forgotten place”.
Poverty pours oil into the fire.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is just as unattainable.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest are sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened several air routes and new immigrants began flowing into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Already so few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education they need to start a business.
“Young people are moving out of villages because of a lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Due to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp - were expelled from the papua for "lack of cooperation with the authorities", all despite the fact that they received such a rare filming permit.
Phelim Kine, the deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Jokowi in his election campaign to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
“Foreign journalists working in the rebel easternmost regions of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: visa waivers and blacklisting,” the statement said.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia in the case of Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "diverse and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shook the accusations when he told reporters in Jakarta: “In Indonesia, the democratic system still applies and the media is free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, the locals shouted, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "we want freedom".
More elections are planned for 2019 in Indonesia, but the Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a robbery army - are wracked by poverty, poor education and the health care system.
Gobai claims that the residents of Pania, like the rest of the Papuans, consider their voice to be a “debt” that Joko has to pay.
“They don’t want money, they want justice,” he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the Paniai shooting, they continue in the last symbolic act of defiance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the grounds opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy has seized a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has detained a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment was going to Australia.
A four-member crew of the ship, apparently from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested during the raid.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and after its arrest, the police dragged it to the port of Nouméa, the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where and where the drugs were going, and to uncover a “Lithuanian syndicate.”
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures they have taken to stop a large number of drugs going to Australia," said Col Blanch, the executive director of the agency.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for its smugglers due to high street drug prices.
The country is also facing the problem of an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current situation is not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drinking is necessary to remind them.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, the solution, according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly M<0xC3><0xA1>dlov<0xC3><0xA1>, could be infusions of a physiological solution that are punctured with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are currently only used in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"And in addition, it loses the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally take less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," M<0xC3><0xA1>dlov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Two liters should drink for sure.
"But getting so much fluid into an old man is a big problem," she added.
In homes for the elderly, she often says, no doctor monitors it.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually addressed by infusions.
"I think they should be gradually introduced there too, so they can get a subcutaneous infusion," she said.
According to her, up to two half-liter bottles of physiological solution can be delivered to the elderly per day.
Lack of fluids can cause nausea, headaches, and decreased performance.
Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it can lead to a stroke.
The blood thickens and clogs the blood vessels in the brain, and kidney failure is also at risk.
Lying patients should not be covered with a feather, maximum cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more nursingly demanding, but it would be ideal to occasionally uncover the patient and let the skin ventilate," she said.
The Torch was on fire for the second time in Dubai.
One of the largest residential skyscrapers in the world was on fire in Dubai on Friday, when firefighters had to evacuate all residents of 337-metre-high and 79-story buildings.
In the last two years, this is already the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is not known.
“We slept and woke up alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor," Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defense said the firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4:00 a.m. (0:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they are providing alternative accommodation for the affected residents.
The incident could once again spark a discussion about the safety of materials used to cladding high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of an investigation launched by the Torch after the fire in 2015 showed that the most damage was done to the cladding and external panels used to decorate or insulate.
British police said the insulation and cladding system at London’s Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in a June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
Survey results show that more than one in five passengers to the U.S. carry prohibited items on board aircraft
A survey of passengers found that more than twenty percent of them knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through the U.S. government agency Transportation Security Administration’s checkpoint on board an aircraft. At least six percent of passengers boarded an aircraft with a knife or other sharp forehand.
Less than one percent of passengers say they were late to find out they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which was answered by more than 1,000 respondents - showed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had attempted to consciously travel with an item that is prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand flying hours, compared with less than 15 percent of Gen X members.
The most common items that have escaped the attention of TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents deliberately uttered a sharp object while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men also admitted to deliberately uttering banned drugs on board aircraft.
The company said it was conducting research among travelers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally passed unauthorised items through airport controls and how many did so on purpose.
It is not surprising that most people who have carried unauthorised items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company has emphasized, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what liquids and how much they can carry into the plane.
It is therefore not surprising that the TSA has seized the largest amount of the newly banned liquid.
For a time, people thought that the TSA would deal with books in the same way as with smuggled goods.
Transfer of liquids is permitted on domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA Chief Scott Pruitt on the postponement of the planned directives to reduce emissions of the Obama administration
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 states, its chief Scott Pruitt revoked his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama administration’s plan to reduce carbon emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes to his plan, responding more flexibly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge filed against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This is the latest date set for 1 October, when countries should start implementing the 2015 ground-level ozone regulation.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interference with local decisions or threatening economic growth.”
Pruitt, who held the position of Oklahoma Attorney General prior to his appointment as EPA chief by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or postponed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden turnaround on Wednesday is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt’s regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA executive exceeded its authority in an effort to delay the Obama administration’s incorporation of a plan that required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed its version of the ozone standards and strengthened the EPA’s commitment to cooperate with states through comprehensive processes and meeting new standards within a given time frame.
“The previous administration of the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set plans,” said Pruitt, who has filed more than a dozen lawsuits with the EPA in his previous position.
“We don’t believe in regulation through litigation and we take compliance seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes from it.”
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that regulation “will be based on sound policies and the most available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group does not intend to allow legal pressure.
"Addressing the EPA's views - following our judicial review - is an important health and safety victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman said in a statement.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone occurs when common harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are applauding Pruitt’s sudden change.
“It’s troubling how much pressure needs to be exerted to change the minds of responsible people and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to struggle with the Trump administration’s ideological drive to help polluters and special interests.”
He's poisoned a man with acid, yet he's not considered dangerous.
You never know what might happen to you.
At one point you’re at home with your family and you’re laughing, at the other you’re suddenly changing your whole life from the ground up.
And the worst part is, you can't do anything about it.
A similar fate was met by Andreas Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was plastered with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
The news was reported by Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on Christopher's door.
Andreas said he was going to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door that was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
A man who had never seen him in his life, immediately after opening, without warning, poured acid on him with the words: "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
My clothes broke off like nothing and I just felt incredible pain on my skin," Andreas said.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but there his loved ones heard a terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
For several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent were affected by a face that doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
A major complication for Christopher was the loss of the eyelids.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his grief.
Today, Christopheros has twelve operations that are far from the last.
Injuries suffered by acid attack victims may require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, victims have tissue scars for the rest of their lives.
“Sometimes people don’t recover and struggle with deformation and disfigurement throughout their lives,” said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that an unknown man must have mistaken him for someone.
The perpetrator believed he was avenging a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police dutifully investigated the case and then tracked down the assailant.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict to the amazement of Christopher's family changed fundamentally.
"The three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be lifted because the man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christophersen.
In the last few years, the number of corrosive attacks has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior expressed its intention to establish new guidelines for prosecutors on the classification of minerals.
They should be classified as one of the most dangerous weapons.
Victims of such attacks have no intention of giving up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer sentences of deprivation of liberty on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require stricter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different shops, as these are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned at night.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the residents of the 80-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's how we were told," one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread downwards with falling burning debris.
We were sleeping.
We woke up alarm, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," tenant George said.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames had engulfed about 40 apartments.
A fire destroyed at least two cars on the ground when they were hit by burning parts of the building.
About two hours later, according to a statement from the civil defense, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses, the current in the surrounding buildings dropped.
A massive fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, nothing happened to anyone, because the inhabitants were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and then became the world’s tallest residential building with its 352 meters.
The following year, another Dubai skyscraper broke the record.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the newspaper Corriere della Serra, the sample of the 23-year-old Ippolito contained a diverse collection of illicit drugs - from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is threatened with a four-year distance and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta was tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record amount for the athletes caught.
A third-tier player began taking steroids a year before he fell bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> in the Czech Republic.
Passionately hugged her ex-lover!
Lucka Vondr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> barely entered the territory of the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
It also attracts attention wherever it comes.
The last time her former lover Michal Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, with whom she lived for three years, fell into her arms.
The actor was then 12 years older and already longed for a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she definitely did not yearn to hang her career on the nail.
So they went away, but the friends remained to this day.
This was also the case at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
By chance, they both blended in blue.
At first they didn't notice each other, but then they got closer, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes until she fell behind her belly.
Then they hugged and posed willingly for the photographers.
However, their meeting was no coincidence, as they will play a lover couple together in the new series Prime Captain Exner.
Islamists were given life in Britain for preparing for the attack.
A British court on Thursday sent four members of an Islamist cell, known as the Three Musketeers, to life in prison and planned a terrorist attack on police and the military, according to the prosecutor's office.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested in August last year.
At the time, the authorities thought they were going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security officers found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions, which in Arabic mean "infidels", and a model of a gun.
This happened at the time when an MI5 secret service agent placed an interceptor in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown how horrifying the defendants could have been if they hadn't been stopped," prosecutor Sue Hemming said.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 can apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n they measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at its peak for just two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, recorded at the Watchtower in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n, it surpassed Thursday, which thus became the warmest day of the year.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records.
On Tuesday, records were broken or leveled at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice, Thursday’s temperature was the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednica in B<0xC5><0x99>eclav, the previous maximum of 37.4 degrees exceeded by four tenths of degrees and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with the Watchtower, came from 2013.
It was ten degrees lower in the west.
On Thursday, high temperatures occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nica, the biggest heat was in Dyj<0xC3><0xA1>kovice in Znojmo and Broda nad Dyj<0xC3><0xAD> in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk, where mercury rose to 37.8 degrees, but did not exceed the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the <0xC4><0x8C>HM<0xC3><0x9A> website, Thursday's highest temperatures have so far been only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there started to rise only later in the afternoon," meteorologists said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>HM<0xC3><0x9A>, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually recede and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia and on Saturday.
There are no tourists in China.
Beijing loses billions due to visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends $10 billion a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushes its entertainment industry to foreign markets, and seeks to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not going to do that.
The state media there talk about the plan to make tourism the driving force of economic transformation and modernization.
Last year, however, the number of arrivals increased by just 3.8 percent and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, assessing the situation in the most populous country in the world, Professor of Economics from the University of Beijing Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free relations with China, the citizens of the other countries have to get their visas in advance.
Therefore, in the Chinese authorities in the US, the crowds are comparable to the celebrations of the Chinese New Year.
The visa costs $140, but if you don’t want to wait for long hours in line, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic hurdles.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance found that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to the country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and lives in less than one percent of the country’s population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when it uses tourism to achieve its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China cut traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a rift around the South Korean anti-missile system, the South Koreans retaliated and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an increase of 85 percent.
All of this has an impact on macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report by the U.S. central bank Fed, China could leave as much as $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China receives about $35 billion a year as part of the sale of currency to incoming tourists.
According to the official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, which is equal to 44 percent of the total Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, therefore, inflict a very painful blow on a country that is anxiously preventing the outflow of capital.
However, the factors mentioned above are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many parts of China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, fewer than a million foreigners lived in China.
In the United States, there are several cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
You won’t find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step offered is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have been making great efforts lately to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen zoo, deadly venomous reptiles reproduced.
The Kingdom of Pilsen poison can enjoy from the young of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine freshly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 meters.
"It's also increasing in length," zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba said.
The young of the other two species, the Death Eaters and the Red Cobras, will gain strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We wouldn't want to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Australian deadly snakes have come to the world eight, they are the descendants of a breeding pair originating from the population around Sydney.
"The only one that visitors can see in the exhibition is among the mortals around Perth," said Vobruba, noting that in human care it is necessary for mortals to winter for 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by the dream of the African spitting red cobra.
A couple in the Pilsen zoo hatched from four eggs a total of four young.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to four meters away.
It's aimed at the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feed on rats in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden still await the laying of young from the dream of a black mammal, eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unauthenticated transcript of a phone call, Trump is creating pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls to the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The U.S. president rebuked him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like this in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump vowed to build a wall along the southern border and announced that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. oversight agreement on refugees heading to Australia was “ridiculous” and “stupid” and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement — which came under President Obama — he would look like a “drugged” U.S. move after he proposed a new deal.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk testified again at the prosecutor's office over Smolensk.
"There's something to be afraid of," said Jaroslaw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski, the brother of the late president, the president of PiS's Law and Justice party.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not intimidate me," Tusk said, explaining to the country's current leadership that he is trying to abuse justice against political opponents.
On leaving the prosecutor’s office, a crowd was waiting for Tusk, which was chanting Donald Tusk! and wishing the politician a hundred years!
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski does not intimidate me."
According to him, he does not blame the prosecutors, but he does not doubt that justice should serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against opponents, the opposition or people they do not like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
He was on the interrogation for the second time.
The former prime minister was interrogated at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time the interrogation was supposed to relate to errors in drunkenness of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, the bodies in the coffin were exchanged.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must have been some reason for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU," Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski said in a statement.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would spoil Tusk’s chances of gaining the most important seat in the Union, of which Poland, of course, has absolutely nothing.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski also said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tusk could be affected differently, but she did not notice.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor’s office on April 19.
He did not speak as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many saw his summons for questioning as part of an apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
In Poland, the Prosecutor’s Office is subordinated to the Minister of Justice, who serves as the Attorney General.
The call for questioning came shortly after Tusk was elected head of the European Council, whom Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski worked hard but tried in vain to prevent, among other things during Merkel’s visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlov<0xC3><0xA1> protested alone.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n also left Warsaw on locks.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the House of Commons from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
This comes from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, it is currently in the comment procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the Ordinance in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry said in a statement.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has changed," it said.
The Ordinance contains two annexes, the first of which lists the representative authorities on which the paper ballots are affixed.
This group of authorities includes the representations of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the press version.
It is their list that is changing.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech embassy in Libya or in Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic also canceled its representation in Bamako, Malaysia and Kyoto, Japan.
There will be no elections at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
Newly, they are on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, the Senegalese capital of Dakar and the Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation with the Consulate General in Iraq's Irbil and Chengdu, the capital of China's S'Chuan province.
Voting tickets will also be available to registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to elect MPs in polling stations at representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the state electoral commission randomly determines the region for which candidates are voted abroad.
It was for the first time in 2002 when the South Moravian candidates were decided.
In the next two elections, Czechs voted abroad among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was chosen as well as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6,700, four years later, 8222.
In the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters arrived at the embassies.
Moore’s Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Remind of Racist Lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed by the sighting residents of Monroe, Georgia, and crouched towards Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car with four black-skinned passengers and a white driver was enough to reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns paved the way for him.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - pulled long from his cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers were shaking with fear.
"We want that n---and Roger!" cried the man.
"Bring it to me!"
The silence is interrupted by the cry of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men jumps over Roger's neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct that fateful night in 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kuklux clan.
No one has been convicted of murder so far.
“It’s amazing that not a single person has been arrested in all these years — even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reconstruction.
“It is a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia Congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic call to action. Every year, the Monroe community reminds that justice has not been done enough.
“We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all,” Brooks said.
Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin.
On July 27, 1946, a forensic doctor covered one of the bodies of the victims of the lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were expected to participate in the lynching.
No one has been prosecuted so far.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights advocates claim that both the reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court of Georgia granted black citizens of Georgia the right to participate in elections scheduled for the summer for the first time.
And it was during the summer election period, according to the FBI, black-skinned farmer Roger Malcolm had stabbed the owner of white-skinned estates, Barnett Hester, during a fight — allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, it was rumored in the city that Hester was hanging out with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the then prominent white-skinned landowner Loy Harrison bailed Malcolm in the amount of $600.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
Upon returning from the prison, just before entering Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects paved the way for them.
"As it turns out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison," the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement officials who not only participated in the lynching, but also discarded the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks made a brief statement on the whole matter.
“It was a massacre because of the right to vote,” he said.
“The murders had a clear subtext for all black locals: ‘This is how you get if you register and go to vote.’”
The annual reconstruction of the Moore's Ford Bridge is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost a decade.
Her performance is figurative, captivating and elaborate, showing deep-seated racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy, and it's even harder to turn a blind eye, but Greene says it makes sense.
"Nobody wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are lurking in each of us," Greene said.
"But there can be no relationship between us if you don't listen to what I've been through."
The main rehearsals of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the very first day about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of the blacks - entered the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kuklux clan, but according to him, the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it goes against who I am," Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time.”
Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcolm, Barnett Hester, practice their roles.
The show begins with a fight - Malcolm argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my land n---e!"
It can't be scratched.
There's a fight going on.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black-skinned actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asked Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene replied cheerfully.
"I just don't think the white people used to say 'n--r' in that tone."
"That's right," said one of the black-skinned actors.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces a sense of rapprochement.
They all want the show to be authentic, just to make sure it's done for four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time, Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word in N.
No one's laughing anymore.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screaming, gunshots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the actors’ bodies and sings Billie Holiday’s sad song “Strange Fruit.”
With every word there is a feeling of sadness in the room.
Against the backdrop of all this, about a dozen viewers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are almost the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
A couple arrived from New York City, Ithaca, many watching them from close quarters.
Each of them tolerates the local wet climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads them in crowds to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Up to this point, murders could have been viewed at a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is spooky.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites a crowd of people watching to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel at the victims’ heads, watch fake blood and motionless bodies, and whisper something into their ears.
'They're not dead, 'said the little boy.
It'll take a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kuklux clan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two fellow actors and cries in their arms; emotions eventually come to him.
"That's okay," one of the women whispered.
“We know your role is up to you.
But you had a reason for it."
Later that day, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is passionately talking about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find words to express her feelings in today's performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those ugly words and look at the ugly deeds... done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still an up-to-date topic," she added, "it's just called police brawls."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying dinner, talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning the performance for the next year.
“The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience – but it’s also a moment to think about,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it.”
I love the instructions to use.
One of my friends says that the instructions for use reads only crap.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where the instructions to use anything was rather a rare phenomenon.
So, for example, my first turntable contained only one piece of paper with hieroglyphics showing the involvement of some components, all of which had some secret marks.
When something went wrong inside me after years, I offered that letter to a shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a grunt, he advised me what that paper with a labyrinth of spells was suitable for.
Yes, it was the usual aid in the chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He quickly found the wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl records again.
A new era has brought new directions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where the sliced grape simply stuck, required about ten pictures.
Particularly successful was the sketch with a description of how to insert one part into the other.
The set was two-part and another procedure was simply not possible.
To give it, on the contrary, required considerable effort with the need to break down certain plastic components.
My contempt for the manual ended at my Seat Leon self-driving car.
The year of production 2003 still had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of a flashlight bulb.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work was to be completed.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual forgot to mention that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
1. Separate the cover.
2. unscrew the cracked bulb and unscrew the new one.
3. insert the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem with the position of the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the abdomen of the car I saw some spring, a screw, with which I easily move the cover and then I will already follow the points 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
I'm sorry, lava.
The cover had no place, no room for the slender hand of Cinderella, especially the obese Slezan.
I've lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The state was further strengthened by the entrance of my wife to the garage, by which he summoned a roar and words, which he hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked helplessly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I omit vulgar terms, there were only two words to publish.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she hurried with a sentence that might be her last in a long-running volume.
Slowly I explained the problem to her, with the main emphasis on the torture procedure of the author of the manual, where the blessing with hot iron on the hand that wrote the manual, then her escape, so that he could never write again, was a mere introduction to his wide range of instructions.
"How about disassembling the box?" the woman said disassembling the battery.
In pure desperation, it happened, and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought he couldn't surprise me.
And that's until the day a colleague called me, who was just discussing the collapse after two State Drug Control Officers were checked.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced both the possible and the impossible in the field and who can interpret wild stories with an undisturbed voice.
"Imagine I was fined for not having my hands washed," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I took out the whole problem, which was that there was no picture instruction on how to wash your hands above the sink in the patient's toilet.
His arguments to the commission official that adults can usually wash their hands and that the need for pictograms to cope with the usual activity of decent people did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just that," she said.
He understood that simply rinsing the swollen hands with running water is a primitive act at the level of the chroma moon, that the modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to say that it is necessary to let out the tap water.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but in the end it is a joyful discovery that a person washes his hands exactly as the S<0xC3><0x9A>KL hosudad orders him.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the activity in the toilet.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will not be a problem, in urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to put up instructions two.
The problem remains with these pictograms, for to create a perfect procedure also means an accurate drawing of all the anatomical details, which could arouse a certain indignation in the prude visitor to the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has erased the corresponding hole during his entire life by a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson to lay off 3,000 more employees and cut dividends in a bid to revitalize business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off another 3,000 employees and cut the interim dividend by 72 percent in response to the next restructuring program to change the business model.
The next wave of layoffs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will occur at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of a previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May as part of its third cost-cutting program in an effort to revive declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Bertelsmann’s Penguin Random House, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after reporting a one-percent increase in core sales in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on Kabul Convoy: NATO Troops Killed in Suicide Bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were killed in the attack in Qarabagh district.
Afghanistan has been hit by a bomb attack this month – more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that the explosion occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a “local person with a household-made explosive device.”
The statement said all the wounded soldiers were out of danger and were stationed at the U.S. military hospital at Baghram Air Force Base.
According to reporters, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO’s allied forces in nearby Baghdad.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20 percent died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Kabul district of Shia.
The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion killed more than 150 people in the center of the city, the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops who should help the country’s military and police forces.
According to reporters, the suicide attacks that he has been training in recent weeks have shaken the public's confidence in the government, its regulations and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA reconsidered its decision to postpone smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has revoked its decision to defer the Obama administration’s bill, which ordered states to cut emissions, just a day after the agency sued 15 states.
On Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to hand over the “Ozone Standards 2015” with the words that it is presenting the agency’s commitment to cooperate with states.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will listen to their views,” EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June an effort by the EPA to delay ozone standards – which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, set limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen from most of the Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit Tuesday on the grounds that EPA action is illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to curb many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama — in Trump’s words — in an effort to kick-start economic growth.
However, the new government’s efforts have launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA says on its website that breathing ozone-containing air “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubn<0xC3><0xA1>r was wounded and bleeding!
This, with us a fairly new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer in our country organized a monstrous event on Czech conditions, which was hosted by such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie B<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xA1>, Simona Lein<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>, and many others.
The purpose was simple, to show themselves to the public and present their music video to the song Sara, whose baptism was hosted by the named personalities.
Few people already know that the filming of the video, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and singer Ladislav Bubn<0xC3><0xA1>r himself had to be treated.
It was his first big recording with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it did not go without a lot of embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, the singer's juice in the video was supposed to indicate a blow of the torch.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and straight in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a wound, I didn't expect it, blood rushed out of my nose immediately," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers told each other that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav was unable to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not severe enough to affect the continuation of the next shoot.
The mentioned video clip of the young artist is now brought to you, you can also record the scene with the punch.
The unpublished version with blood, however, was not preferred to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of a duel between them
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting light-weight boxing match, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each of them was in a separate room at ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - the undefeated lightweight World Boxing Council champion - came down to the hall, where he welcomed Lomachenko, the featherweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory in a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime match, both boxers were on the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 19:00 on Saturday.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be “the perfect test”.
"I'm a former featherweight champion," Garcia adds.
“I had to raise 67 kg because of the fight with Broner, but I’m not that big.
I am small at 63 kg.
I would like to go back to the category of light weight.
Lomachenko has to pull up again to gain a light weight... then we can compete.
That's what fans want.
Why don't they do it."
Lomachenko agrees.
"Boxing would benefit from this game."
Climate raised the demand for a pay-per-view - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko is expected to make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and next year to compete with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed an interest in the game against the winner of the duel in the Forum.
“The match should be a pay-per-view style, that’s what fans are asking for,” said Garcia, who later said he was open to the possibility of broadcasting the match through a TV station that comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will get that kind of attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as an "astonishing boxer" and could take part in his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, did not allow Garcia's praise to waver when he said the Riverside three-division champion looked "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt a rising tension in front of each other.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other match attracts so much attention to itself.
And I will gladly put it in the fire," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It's going to be a great match."
The young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
They found their car at the bottom of the Volga.
A couple of young Russians Ilya <0xC5><0xBD>irnov and Kira Cherkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was a great search for them, but without success.
And the police eventually ended the investigation due to a lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the story came to an end.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Cheboksary in the Czech Republic.
Only with the documents that remained in the car, the police were able to identify a few.
The documents survived for a decade underwater, without them it would have taken the police much longer to find out the identities of those found.
The couple was last seen when <0xC5><0xBD>irnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous for the time being.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksary police, who pulled the car out to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by a frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing and further details will be published once it has been completed.
Latest results of tests to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum-seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people were surveyed as older than 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (R<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) began carrying out new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to more accurately assess applicants in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. The measure was acceded after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6,880 cases to investigate, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were assessed as over 18 years old, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency found that the respondent was “possibly over 18 years old.”
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the respondent was “possibly under 18 years of age”.
The tests shall be accessed only if the age of the questioned person is questionable.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics are on track and the numbers are very similar," he told The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age was estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that applicants for asylum are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases, it was found that "the person in question is 18 years of age or older."
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent stated that he would be 18 this year.
Critics also criticized the medical method of determining age, which includes x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and x-ray specialists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which they went through puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are right.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can’t determine the age with precision, we shouldn’t pretend otherwise,” he told Metro.
The forensic medical agency Agency's G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson defended the decision, saying: "In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the respondent is just below the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents.
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
In a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened not to meet him if he publicly said his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would somehow be arranged, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to transcripts of interviews published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto non-diplomatically punished him for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and urged the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump said repeatedly in a January 27 interview, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continues to make defiant statements.
Funding is going to work out and eventually it will work out well.
“But if you say Mexico will not pay for the wall, then I don’t want to be with you gentlemen anymore, because that’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
The wall has been described as the least important thing we are talking about, but politically it is perhaps the most important.
The executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after taking power.
Mexico has refused to build and finance the 3,200-kilometre-long wall, which has jeopardised relations between the two countries.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would be paid by the United States.
Trump finally met with his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump’s January 28 phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull.
The head of the White House called the conversation ridiculous.
He was led to this conclusion by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting persons from internment facilities in Pacific island states.
Trump initially thought the deal was stupid, but later he agreed to it.
"I'm sure you can say that this is not an agreement you've made, but you're going to have to stick to it," Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, a telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump praised the Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
But suddenly the tone of the conversation was sharpened.
“I hate the reception of these people,” Trump said.
I assure you they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
“They’re not going to be great people who go to work for local dairy farmers,” he said.
In the interview, he also said that the refugee could become a Boston assassin in five years.
At the end of January, about a week after he arrived at the White House, Trump conducted telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen, often several in a single day.
The conversation with Turnbull was the least pleasant for the whole day.
Before he finished, he said he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Rana's killer was executed before the crowd.
Her father was watching too.
The execution took place on the square in the capital of Yemen, Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, raped her, and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then threw near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl has affected the entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari was the first of a thousand-headed crowd to come together to witness the execution.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day in my life.
The other members of the family were also present, together with the crowd shouting the slogan "Long live justice".
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was dragged.
The policemen tied him up on his stomach.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and fired from the immediate vicinity.
The crowd here celebrated every blow that was blown.
Mr al-Almatari told MailOnline that justice had been done in accordance with the country’s legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won," he added.
I was standing in Liberation Square in Sana'a waiting for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hateful madness, catching the killer and lynching.
The execution was ordered by a court under the rule of the Shia Houthis.
Originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 wounds with a whip immediately after his arrest, but his act aroused such outrage that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
His family knew him well.
When police searched the cellar of his house, they found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even the animal would be more merciful to the wound.
"Our family has no enemies and the injuries that carried Rana's body were terrible," he said.
"The wound disappeared this afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her photo hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer's parents who suspected their son of a horrific act.
The girl’s mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter’s body had been found.
Rana went out to play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al-Maghrabi was held and demand immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read to the crowd the record of the investigation to reassure them.
The accused apparently did not show any regrets for his act.
Just before the execution, the policemen read the sentence to him, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The entire event was filmed for national television, but many recordings were made by the crowd on the internet.
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Political Party
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday evening at President Trump’s assembly that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," Justice said.
“Today, after a long prayer and reflection, I announce to you... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I am telling you that I can no longer support you from the position of democratic governor.”
The crowd of viewers was bursting with joy.
“Tomorrow I’m going to join the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I can tell you it’s time to jump into another game.”
Trump has previously promised people at a rally in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, issued a statement Thursday night saying: “The Governor of Justice’s move is another wound for a democratic party that is putting obstacles in our way, rather than causing a lifting of our country.”
“For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislature in history, the announcement by the Governor of Justice is the last straw for an already deprived leaderless party that is futilely striving to find positive and unifying news,” said RNC President Ronna McDln<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC4><0x9B>.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology for doping scandal
Former top athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time had not yet come for Russia to return to the sporting world.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that his country's expulsion from the world of sport was right and that he is committed to fighting doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into effect in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found that Russia was supporting doping of its athletes.
“I think today we witnessed a very sincere response and presentation,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation.”
Coe said he was also “pleased” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today has been very successful and we have moved to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to maintain the punishment that has been imposed on Russia,” Coe added.
“In the coming months, we need to do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
“Our goal has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest athletes,” he said.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which begins on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag, who have complied with the strict rules of the IAAF.
IAAF Crisis Chief of Staff Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it can be allowed back.
Drug tests are still unsatisfactory and exclusion coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board’s presentation ended.
The state contract for CzechTrade was awarded to the company Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova, whose state is being prosecuted.
The publication Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov was awarded a public contract by the state export agency CzechTrade.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecuted Savov for tax fraud and demanded his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the CzechTrade Ministry of Industry and Trade’s pro-export agency published a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
A total value of CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the publishing house Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta by entrepreneur Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are prosecuting him on the run.
Savov fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is asking for his release.
The requested URL was not found on this server.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade was to decide on the award of the contract from 60 percent of the price offered and from the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
Savov’s company, however, was greatly helped by the second criterion.
According to the information Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all sub-quality criteria.
As a result, it was moved ahead of another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with an amount of CZK 404,900 per month, VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received an under-average score of 62 points from the evaluators in all the qualitative criteria.
Tendru was also attended by the consulting company BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which also belongs to the server Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz under the publishing house Economia.
VLM submitted several objections to the result of the tender, arguing that its assessment was unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it was decided to contest the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
It is believed that CzechTrade acted contrary to the law.
"The proposer is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a contracting authority on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, which clearly favours the participant Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta, a.s., at the expense of the proposer and other suppliers," writes in the proposal for the opening of the procedure server submitted to <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
According to the CEO and Chairman of the Board of VLM Michal Kl<0xC3><0xAD>ma, the selection committee’s scoring seems to be an incredible and 100% assessment of the Young Front project among all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as improbable and suspicious," he said in a statement.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
In principle, CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract mentioned by you is, in accordance with the law, published in the profile of the contracting authority and in the Procurement Notice.
"After the completion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot comment on its progress," <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, a media representative of the agency, told Dotyk.cz.
The young front reacted with a statement that it considers it extremely problematic that the publishing house Economia has interfered with an article in Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in that article.
In the tender, she could have been helped by the fact that it was she who had provided the BusinessInfo editorial services portal in the previous four years.
The contract was awarded for the first time in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Martim Kuba ODS.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions to his companies, which caused the Czech state an alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been requesting the UK to release it since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, is behind his criminalization, under whose influence the Mafra publishing house falls.
Last year, the London court rejected Savov's appeal against his extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any information from the UK regarding the acquisition of the legal power of the judgment to date," <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was listed in Harvestor Limited, headquartered in Cyprus, which controlled the Czech Budweiser brewery Samson, and in the Cyprus company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
It will also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the expulsion of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker ran along the sidewalks and the park, ended up in the squats.
The biker drew attention to himself with a ruthless ride on the streets, sidewalks and park roads in <0xC3><0x9A><0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
When the patrol began to pursue him, he decided to take her in the direction of the Settlement.
"Policemen were being chased by the city with increased caution when he failed to drive on one of the side roads behind the Marian Spa and drove his motorcycle into the field where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k said.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to arrive, which transported the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
Police later found that the biker did not own a driver’s license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were stolen, his production number was erased, and the production label itself was removed.
It is possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breath test performed at the scene excluded the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test found a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How the Financial Rules of Football Will Affect Neymar's Move to Paris
The rules restricting the funding of European football clubs in no way interfere with Neymar’s record-breaking move from Spain’s Barcelona to France’s Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalties for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, introduced by UEFA in 2011, stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Following are several financial conditions for Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is financed by a wealthy Qatari family that has been enriched by the sale of energy, they can afford to bring Neymar to the already star-studded football family.
Clubs can spend a huge amount to buy players, but on the other hand they have to prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the direct costs of football-related business activities.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after he was appointed UEFA director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that are indebted in the pursuit of new reinforcements are ultimately cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP rules redirected its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with potential and spend horent sums for players to build a global brand – was suddenly not so profitable.
Within the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite Platini having to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander Ceferin is committed to defending the ban on excessive spending.
“The FFP rules are still in force and we are committed to strengthening them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP compliance, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid the amount for the purchase of Neymar on a one-off basis, it can distribute the amount for accounting purposes over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be written off at EUR 44.4 million per year for five years.
The first wave of FFP’s highest sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi.
PSG imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million - and an order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies affiliated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
UEFA joined in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
A portion of Neymar’s income at PSG could be paid off by the organisational commission of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, PSG and the representatives of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar denied the fat that Neymat should become an ambassador of the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver would be easily revealed by UEFY officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules.
According to a statement on Tuesday, UEFA has not opened an investigation into the transfer of Neymar to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous as it was not authorized to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The most recent published financial statements show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar will be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and sales of jerseys.
The club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Representatives of the Spanish league, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG violated the rules of the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' of the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, citing the ownership of the club by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's stance on financing the club.
“It’s a consequence of ownership that has fundamentally changed the world of football in the last 15 years,” Wenger said.
“As soon as he becomes the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult, because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan midfielder Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>: Changes are painful, but we must believe.
Sixteen thousand cheering fans on their feet.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> goes to the square.
Same scene as Sunday's match against the Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder moved the game against the Red Star, invented several goals, but his teammates did not aim for black.
The flight team pumped with new multimillion-dollar boosts thus ends after the opening duel in the European Cups.
Was it difficult to do anything else with the match after the goal of Belgrade?
After the incoming goal it was necessary to shoot four, which was difficult for us.
At least we didn’t want to lose, to raise our self-confidence, so that we had something to turn away from in the next matches.
We had some chances.
We need to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why didn't Sparta get into the game for so long?
The game is horribly elaborated.
The combination of the opponents was much better than ours.
We didn't do anything, we shot once in half the time.
This is of course very little if you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push opponents more often into such positions.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the composition?
Of course, it is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We have only played three competitions and the line-up is always changing.
The goal is for the coach to find the perfect 11 to sit on.
Is it encouraging to you that you have already played parts of two matches in a row?
These are just parts of the game.
“I don’t know how my condition will develop and when I could finally play from the start.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise we can't.
It's the same as an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in great numbers, but they left in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
It was a wonderful visit again, just like with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show them something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember those visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting with ourselves, we're getting married, so it's not that good for us.
For an extreme tax evasion, an entrepreneur has to sit for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Toman, who is expected to serve ten years in prison for cutting taxes to a considerable extent.
The estimated damage is CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed in the complaint that justice violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Judges found the complaint unfounded, the CTC found from the court’s database.
It is not another court of appeal.
"As a fourth instance, it cannot judge the factual or legal errors allegedly committed by the general courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition detention in Argentina, where he was still in detention at the time of the decision.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage incurred.
The Supreme Court called the case an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The CZK 645 million damage occurred between January and July 2008, with the total leakage exceeding CZK 1 billion, according to experts.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the prosecution, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise taxes in the order of tens of millions of crowns, she paid taxes in just hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company traded have a relationship with businessman Radomir Vyb<0xC3><0xAD>ral, whom the court awarded 13 years in prison for machining with VAT in fuel shops.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court a long time ago.
The series "A Year in the Life" and "Comrade Detective" play on a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic both for the characters from the famous 80s; for the dirty 90s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter put on MTV's comedy sketch "The State"); and, of course, for the modern era, specifically the year 2001, before the stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Paul Ruhler, and others such as Ruhl.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From a French perspective, however, it seems that someone is short of breath.
The show "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only because of the absurd humor (an example can be the story of the emergence of a talking can of vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors deviated from the main funny points - middle-aged actors playing teenage horny children - and could not draw from previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults, does not put as much pressure on the emotional level and satire is sometimes sporadic, including a parody of the 1990s thriller "Hand on the Cradle".
At one point, the character finds a heap of ragged Apple Powerbook, roller skates, and “a plethora of other things from 1991.”
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
Good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has still not passed over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the insane plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is spurred on by George H. W. Bush (very well-mannered Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise are many side stories.
Especially fun is to watch the eternally young Rudd with long hair alias the character of Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind the old pepper.
The franchise could be triggered by moments of random madness, such as a return to the "Seven Up" series, until it reaches what I presume will be a logical break-up: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last scene, the entire group will go to the premiere of "Summer to Nowhere."
“Comrade Detective” on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to another type of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of the series “Such Normal Americans,” the film “Atomic Blonde: Without Regret” and even the series “GLOW,” in which the icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes collide.
The comedy by the creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is set to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulica, who were recruited into the English language by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it is not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as cops watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series was voiced by many famous actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
"Comrade Detective" focuses too much on the unskillful propaganda drama - which includes the Reagan masked killer - and it looks like it too.
Six long episodes are too far-fetched and comedy moments are not enough.
On a shorter track, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose hall two fat men swallow hamburgers stored in a large pile.
The clear message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not wait for the IAAF to lift the start ban.
The International Athletics Federation (IAAF) has confirmed at a congress in London the extension of the international ban on Russian racers due to the state-sponsored doping program.
The vote at the World Championships, which will start on Friday, is expected to take place very unequivocally.
A total of 166 delegates voted to extend the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is above all the fact that Russia is not able to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as stated before the congress by the head of the special investigation group of the IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and coaches with a shattered reputation are still working in the country.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, has not yet been fully operational.
However, RUSADA can no longer carry out tests under the supervision of foreign experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency.
“Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done,” said IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, leaving Russian athletes to lose, among other things, to last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban of the upcoming MS will participate 19 Russians, who have already proven that they have been tested for a long time outside the Russian anti-doping system.
However, they will not be able to start the championship in national colors and in case of victory they will not play the Russian anthem.
Bank of England to keep interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged as a result of insignificant economic growth and weakening inflation, which has led to speculation about sharp growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain “backgrounded” in the context of maintaining interest rates – despite the demand for family budgets.
Banks of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted six to two to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote to raise the interest rate supported unimportant economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the decline in family budgets will continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the bank suggested that in the next few years there should be growth due to inflation caused by Brexit, and also said that rents on movables should increase more than expected in the financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Term Financing Plan, which will offer low-cost subsidies to banks, is expected to come into effect from next February, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion less than the planned <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household incomes and the burden of consumption.”
On the issue of rates, the bank said it would need to “stretch the belts of monetary policy” to calm inflation, “to a greater extent” than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be “slow” and “limited”.
The bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next year, down from 1.9% and 1.7% forecasts in May.
The projected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision to maintain the current state of affairs came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth – GDP slumped to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to rise slightly by the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest report on inflation is a minor consolation for households affected by rising inflation and miserable wage increases. The bank said the situation was worsening before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy “cannot prevent” income declines in the coming years, but wages are expected to “significantly” rise at the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy is also expected to grow due to a strong interest in British goods due to the weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after rates were reduced to 0.025% in August last year in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that a complete unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Before the bank’s decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates, along with rising inflation, which was under increasing pressure on households. Three political figures demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% from 2.9% in June last month, even though the bank said it expected such a change and expected inflation to rise again over the next month.
The bank stated that exceeding the target relative to 2% was “complete” as a result of the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Due to the recent decline in swap rates, it looks like the competition in the mortgage market will only increase once creditors start competing for contracts with a view to a good outlook for the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and re-mortgages - there are no-fee options on offer, as well as the low rates they are gaining in popularity."
NHS Prescribes Controversial HIV Drug to 10,000 Patients
Patients will have access to ‘transformative’ HIV prevention treatment since September, based on the Supreme Court’s decision on funding the NHS drug.
The English National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to fund the trial after the appeals court upheld last year’s Supreme Court decision stating that the NHS has the funds to pay for PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was taken by NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention,” while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 will be fully implemented across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among at-risk patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there is a sufficient number of specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These drugs can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among the patients tested were gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who were not treated successfully.
The clinics will identify eligible participants who will sign consent to participate in the testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will bring taxpayers to <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England has signed a drug distribution contract this week after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully leverage the ever-expanding and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It’s another milestone in a more than 30-year effort to stop one of the biggest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National AIDS Trust (NAT), said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and to patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will lead to improved quality of life for many.
We welcome this statement with pleasure.”
Ian Green, executive director of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure its availability to every patient.
We now have the trial drug PrEP available, and we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.”
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us a step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
“It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and, together, to stop the spread of HIV in society.”
Life on a high foot: the mezzanine and smart design turned this small apartment at Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment at the Earls Court in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of the smart terrace Queen Anne - and is a striking example of modern design, which makes maximum use of available space.
“I used to live with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I immediately fell in love with him and nodded at him the same day."
Since then, the apartment of the size of 1000 square meters has undergone a complete renovation.
One-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen - wanted Joanne to add storage spaces and mezzanine to use the high ceiling.
“I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and plenty of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
For this purpose, she employed Erfana Azadi from the Duck & Shed design and design studio based in Notting Hill and used the nearly four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height that two gaps could climb over each other - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine on which one could walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
“The steel structure is quite complicated,” he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, but also bending the steel structure to make it at the right height above and below the ceiling.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on himself - and at the same time add drama.
The mezzanine overlooks the beautiful living room of an old copper window frame in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver line and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to another room.
At the front door there are storage rooms equipped with mirrors for storing utensils and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the ability to separate it from the kitchen, if not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, are the folding doors.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced veneered doors.
"The door is equipped with counterweights to play very easily."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is the living space - or the valuation of your property," Erfan said.
"A real estate agent basically calculates his price on the basis of the living space when he enters the apartment."
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious appearance.
“The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t like the electricity in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your heart won’t win.”
As it turned out, a quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can eventually decide to stay.
The United States is collapsing.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has banned its citizens from travelling to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated and issued a retaliatory travel ban for its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, U.S. citizens can travel freely in all fifty states.
This is because California has banned spending state money on the travel of its citizens to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT and considers any expression of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle as discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has passed a conscientious objection law that states that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients has no obligation to provide it to them, but has an obligation to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have enacted laws under which religious charities that have given birth to children after their mothers have no obligation to provide these children for adoption to same-sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has banned the financing of its citizens’ trips to eight states of the Union from its resources.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have pathways to scientific symposia in Texas, for example, paid for by their universities because they are co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, in Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They must receive federal grants for travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund the travel of citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has lost patience and its parliament passed a law with a resolution that it also dislikes California’s policy of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits, and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not apply a travel embargo in California because of this.
He's rolling them out in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any State of the Union that would order a similar travel ban on another State for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now a comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to enact laws on conscientious objection, as well as to decide what their money will be used for and what they are not allowed to do.
Secondly, what is wrong with conscientious objection?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can’t he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why force the pigs to sell it under the penalty of punishment, when there are enough butchers offering pigs?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policies in powers that are not federal, according to their own, that is, according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of live and let live that should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I do not know the situation in American history where states have done such a thing for political reasons, except for the case of one.
Even in times of struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South were on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1950s of the 19th century, the political cause was slavery and tended to the war of the North against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue democratic and red republican states is deepening and the United States is mentally intertwining.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critic was fined.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year’s presidential election.
The court imposed a fine on him for calling for people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests and announced that he wants to apply for the post of head of state in March next year.
Kremlin President Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He was fined for urging people to demonstrate through videos posted on YouTube.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off the judge's payroll later," a Kremlin critic tweeted.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the verdict to be politically motivated.
Fines of 300,000 rubles, including 25,000 rubles, were also imposed by the court on Thursday on two members of the Naval election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in every way possible in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry company.
The verdict was confirmed by an appeals court in May.
The verdict is so valid, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth over $500 million.
Two brothers are now, more than four decades after their Italian family founded the empire, pulling for one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides at Toorak Manor, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has brought a dispute over common property and business assets to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but a sharp dispute is constantly being perpetuated in the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother Anna, his brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this location, the Westco Jeans family founded the company, which has grown into a chain of 160 stone stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
The De Lutis family’s portfolio now includes offices, construction land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Paul owns approximately one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who is, according to Paul, "a significant driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court records state that Colin owns $316 million worth of property, while Paul manages the property for $176 million.
For Paul, it was precisely the distribution of assets and funds that became problematic.
“Colin’s proposal sounded to me strongly in his favor,” Paul wrote in a sub-jurisdictional statement to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also competing over who will control the existing business - from which Paula, according to him, Colin cut off.
Colin denies that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some of the properties.
In a previous statement, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
“My Italian background dictates to me that family is the most important thing,” he wrote.
Hundreds of sites of under-sworn statements, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooded with lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and advocates of both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had been running milk bars and treats since the 1950s and bought a grocery store in Brunswick in the 1970s.
For the money earned by stopping the property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened his first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his last year of college, Paul was still a little boy, about 10 years old."
Anna De Lutis said that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of the property to the sons would take place for good.
"Luigi has often said that he never wanted his sons to go to trial," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies. Colin said Mark was compensated by $10 million on his departure and Luke by $26 million.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark “were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Colin has held back since then, despite the fact that he is a former AFL board member, as Eddie McGuire, a famous television personality and Colin's best friend, said in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin responded only through a text message stating that, given the fact that the dispute is being settled in court, "I have nothing to add."
“It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take the whole matter to court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin stated in a court statement that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s demands.
“Our father would be very dissatisfied if he saw our current situation,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a successful solution.”
On Friday, all hope was in sight.
“Our disputes will be resolved in court very soon,” Colin wrote.
Vedra in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower their children.
MHD drivers pack both water and summer clothes.
In the kindergarten Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now attending, they go out only in the morning.
The school is after reconstruction and the planted trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There is no swimming pool, but teachers shower children in the fog.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classrooms, where the blinds and the curtains are pulled down.
The air tries to cool the clean air because they do not have air conditioning.
It is also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature inside and outside is above the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we shouldn't even be open during this period," said kindergarten director Miloslava Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In the nursery there is a glass corridor, where according to it the temperature varies about 40 degrees.
We will ventilate in the morning after 6 o'clock, the windows will close and we have on the southern sides of the blinds, with which we protect ourselves.
"But it's not going to help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hr<0xC3><0xA1>za in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have grown trees on the land, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful nutmeg there, there's a table under it, and we're doing different things there," school principal Barbora Kompanov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Teachers try to go with the children to the forest, where there is more coolness.
Children have wet caps and on the program they have different games with water.
"We have a manual pressure sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," said Companion.
Jitka Vilimovsk<0xC3><0xA1>, the director of the kindergarten in Novoborsk<0xC3><0xA1> street in Prague’s Prosek, also said that teachers try to keep children in the shadows and splash them with water.
"We have a fairly large garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then only after 3 p.m.
Every child must have a head covering.
The teachers also remind the children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweetened tea or diluted juice and have a drink of water in the garden.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad to eat and always fresh fruit and vegetables for snacks, which sometimes parents bring to them.
"Perhaps today one mother brought about ten kilos of melon for the children," Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> added.
Drivers receive water or summer uniforms.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion beverages or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of tram and bus drivers are in most cases air-conditioned, DPP spokeswoman Aneta <0xC5><0x98>ehkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger area.
The high-temperature tram tracks have not yet been seriously damaged.
A small damage occurred in the loop in Hostiva<0xC5><0x99>.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks at their disposal.
"Cooled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and roads," <0xC5><0x98>ehkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Employees have so-called so-called so-called sodobaries, which produce refrigerated sodium hydroxide, available on the road and in some alternate locations.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion beverages.
"They can also take advantage of the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the spokeswoman added.
The hot and dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increase in the number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic eliminated 108 of them, twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday night, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly engaged in fighting the fire.
"The fires in the natural environment and those associated with harvesting work are prevalent," said firefighters spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
The firefighters were not relieved even by the evening weather change, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by storms and torrential rains.
In connection with the storms, the firefighters drove out to 236 strikes.
It was mainly about the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened the most in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralov<0xC3><0xA1> continues.
But firefighters also needed help in Stvol<0xC3><0xAD>nky, Czechoslovakia, where 60 people from the children’s camp were evacuated to safety due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also given work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances drove out to dozens of cases of carbon dioxide poisoning from karma.
Therefore, people should have their water heaters checked, the rescuers warn.
Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odourless gas that is released by imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infected room.
Trump's New Chief of Staff Plans to Restrict President's Media Diet
Many have tried it before and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico said the new White House chief of staff plans to curb the flow of President Trump’s information — including reports in television news — in the hopes of keeping Trump on the ground.
Here is the report by Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met for the first day in office with the staff, he outlined a key issue for the Trump White House that he intends to fix: misinformation that gets into the hands of the president.
Kelly told employees that he had to personally approve all the information — whether on paper or in a spoken word — because the president could make better decisions based on the right information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have cracked their teeth at checking Trump and his media appearances.
Trump’s relationship with the media dates back several decades – and now that he’s sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
“If Trump as a candidate was upset by honest reporting, it was appropriate for him to show that he was being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media outlets that were easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets on the line – at least according to the words of six former campaign organizers – is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that praises him.”
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaigners know something that others don’t know — that Trump’s tweets would be more outrageous if someone didn’t check them.
The tweets that Trump never sent out are unlikely to be heard.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least several times, then their efforts did not go to waste.
But so far, no one has been able to regularly prevent Trump from inciting controversial issues.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people are regularly trying to strengthen their agenda by spurring Trump’s materials — which may, but may not be reliable — that support their view of the world.
Politico, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the inclination of advisers to submit dubious information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Contemporary and former Trump officials claim that the president often responds very angryly to negative news from the media, especially reports of information leaks, and seeks to find their origin.
The situation came at the end of February when someone tipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com — the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson — that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source of many leaks” from the White House.
Notwithstanding that Johnson was forever expelled from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claims with any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter “were trying to implement a system to administer and document the information that President Trump will receive.”
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to enforce the same strategy.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsiveness just doesn’t go away and his aides are still competing for power.
These immutable factors will certainly make Kelly's mission more difficult.
Tourists Negotiate Grave and Return to ‘Millionaire Quarter’
Several of the most affluent homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again getting into negotiations with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities about the rights to reclaim the field behind their mansions.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field on a thriving street in the town of Solihull, nicknamed the “millionaire’s quarter.”
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after they were expelled in May. They were not afraid of a ditch, which was dug on the spot by order of the authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with the caravans unprotected by the gap that served as a way.
The indignant residents of the neighborhood attacked Solihull’s board of directors saying they were “not able to solve the problem.”
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘They occupied the place on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they are back.
Last night there were more, and today there will probably be more.'
She added: “Birmingham’s board of directors knows how to deal with this issue, using court orders to protect parks.
I live in Streetsbrook and I'm not going to continue paying taxes until the board of directors settles with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: ‘It’s ridiculous. We just recently watched the last tourists leaving and now they’re back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they brought their horses with them.'
A spokesman for the Solihull City Council said: “We are aware of the unauthorised stay on the land near Streetsbrook Road and are taking the necessary legal steps in cooperation with the local police to successfully resolve the whole issue.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any non-social or illegal behavior on the shelf at number 101.
This will give us a full picture of what we are going to do in court.”
The wife of the MEP hit a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
The government special transported the injured Robert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xBD> to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and the plane was under constant supervision of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
R<0xC3><0xB3>bert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xBD> had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer, according to TV JOJ.
He was reportedly hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After his transfer to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace in one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the Slovak MEP Jana <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xA1> from NOVA.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italians hold firm in the fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving on the coast of Italy with migrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGOs sign new rules regulating their operations.
"Unless NGOs sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities seized the German rescue ship Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, significantly easing illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which operates for the first year, refused to comment on the whole matter on charges brought by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
"For us, saving lives is and always will be the number one priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones," the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only comment on all the current allegations after gathering all the information and evaluating the whole situation.”
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa boat of the organization Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board, which were handed over directly to them by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place, according to the plaintiff’s file, only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The organization said on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, as they do not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" to rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct was also rejected by the organization Médecins Sans Fronti<0xC3><0xA8>res (MSF), which is the winner of the Nobel Prize.
Minniti, meanwhile, has been told that the sharp decline in recent weeks in migrants disembarking in Italy as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the Libyan coast and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In the last few days, we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further talks to be held this month with the mayor of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Unashamed Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>: Silicone and cellulite climbed from everywhere!
Hot summer days are all about taking on only the most necessary things that will cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1> does the opposite.
For an afternoon meeting in the Prague zoo, where actors, moderators, singers and everyone who has anything to do with TV Prima, just moaned, she wrapped her body in a mini-overall.
And just a few normal movements, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her buttocks.
He had cut himself in half so many times that he had to chew it so high that he had to adjust it all the time.
There was absolutely no need for the attention of the gentlemen and photographers present.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Sending Text Messages Inciting Conrad Roy's Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
20-year-old Michelle Carter is sentenced to 15 months in prison and then to five years in parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was left at large until the decision was made.
She was threatened with up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream blouses, Carter stood at the scene of her verdict, with tears in her eyes, her hands clenched, and her eyes turned to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff told the judge.
“She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
Carter’s attorney, however, said it was “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder does not have a significant impact on her conduct.”
The plaintiff read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “There won’t be a single day before I grieve over the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever," the statement said.
Roy's sister Camdy Roy testified that she was "stalked" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be his children's aunt.
"The loss of the person I've seen since I was born is the pain I'll carry with me for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would affect a person assisting in the suicide of another person. This case thus establishes a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014 poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published that incited suicide.
“Perhaps hanging out, jumping out of a building, or getting stabbed, I don’t care,” Carter wrote in text messages sent just two weeks before he died when Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "Just throw in the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter had longed for attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from commenting in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Audi to adjust up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the announcement, Audi car maker BMW said it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is home to BMW - considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to a large extent in order to comply with the regulation on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of car manufacturers to install gas neutralization equipment emitted by diesel engines, which makes it difficult for cars to compete.
While German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which in an effort to meet emission limits installed software in its cars, which during testing reduced the amount of emissions emitted, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been indicted in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics at Audi’s engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and therefore not subject to extradition, so he can face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation by German police into the Volkswagen car after authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to circumvent European emissions limits - thus expanding the accusations that Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could have a disproportionate impact on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane landed on the beach.
A man and a girl were killed.
The accident occurred on Praia de S<0xC3><0xA3>o Jo<0xC3><0xA3>o beach in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One witness told the SIC Noticias television channel that the plane was flying just above the people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach allegedly ran away from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people were unable to escape from the machine.
According to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias said.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people aboard the plane, both of whom were rescued alive from the crash and taken by police for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are the highways in the Czech Republic complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It is undeveloped, although it began to be built as early as 1978.
Even if it is undeveloped, it is constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built again, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the D11 dam highway.
The construction of another section of it for at least a few months has now been stopped by the Children of Earth movement.
We easterners get to the highway in pieces, as if cutting salads.
The wheel will be trimmed and then we'll see when and if we'll get another one.
We don’t want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite flows of trucks go directly through the city of Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> or N<0xC3><0xA1>chod, which is not a reasonable object.
But so far, the last section of our dream highway was commissioned in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a touch since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section towards Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové and the other sections towards Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> began to be built recently, an archaeological survey began with the fact that the construction will begin at the end of this year, you could hear loud noises in eastern Bohemia.
After all, no one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that there will be no construction this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has caused disintegration.
Children of the Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
The decisions on building permits have been challenged in their entirety.
In decommissioning, they shall request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the castle magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So for now we descend from D11 near the village with the eloquent name Pohreba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
So we go down, we just go down the highway and all of a sudden we stand on the side road and we prefer to join the column afterwards.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the country.
Terrifying, constantly clogged road to Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their own burying place.
What do the children of the earth want?
What is the nature of the problems of construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why in the current system, the highway network is practically incomplete?
Read in a new reflex.
Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in southeastern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining as a result of dry climate and harmful insects, causing horror on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
It is also the fault of cicadas and mosquitoes carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in dry climates.”
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil produced from it is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers grow smaller, undeveloped and often weaker plants.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution may be more efficient water distribution and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
Employees of the Riodoce weekly meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss the news of the unrest taking place in the Sinaloa area with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
Today, however, under the onslaught of recent events, he meets mainly for his own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that someone attacked with a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They will ask journalists to name each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and forethought.
To choose from what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose task is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence continues and bodies are being thrown into a heap across the country; journalists are constantly increasing among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, there are at least 25 of them since the inauguration of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection since the beginning of the war; and 589 are under federal protection.
Among them also the co-founder of the magazine Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to the drug trade.
His loss is perceptible, although his presence is pervasive - a large photo of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", on which the middleman is shown, hanging in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez on their face and a smile on their face.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about each other's traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalist cases, it has so far sued two suspects, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, so that the killers of journalists are very exceptionally brought to justice.
Riodoc journalists insist that they will report on the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; despite the fact that they are devastated and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the murders and without a vision of justice, a security meeting is irrelevant, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time on meetings like this," he adds.
“If we don’t get more information, we can’t trust anyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoce's headquarters in Culiacan, Sinaloa's capital.
He managed to escape several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then boarded his car and broke into it near the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
It seems that rumors are spreading rapidly in Culiacan.
In Valdez’s case, however, there is only suspicious silence.
Since Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n's arrest last year and his January extradition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions try to fill the void.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa and the cemetery is full of graceful two-story mausoleums for drug lords, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “strike” means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel to the United States of drugs.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, the co-founder and director of Riodoc, still resigns from not protecting his friend.
He believes that two errors have contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with the sons of Joaqu<0xC3><0xAD>n Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n.
The peace could have angered the sons; the suspect gang members snatched up all copies of the papers the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after capturing other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the journal Noroeste, he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and found along with five of Riodoc's colleagues.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to run a newspaper without mentioning the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and truthful news; the newspapers began to prosper.
Journalists like to search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to write.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his brave reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I was worried about my life,” he said as he accepted the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is “a way of life,” Valdez told Rompeviento TV in October last year.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist – or play a fool.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What were you doing in the face of death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?'"
The employees of Riodoc miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all depended on their daily routines.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the bar El Guayabo opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death in them also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
“They don’t like it when you get entangled with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret landing sites.”
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like there's something wrong here, put your hands away.
The problem is, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, that "someone's a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoc employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered that was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief from the forty-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-story building in the borough of Culiacan.
Journalists are stunned by the fact that these police officers are not among the 50 percent of law enforcement officers who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It’s been several months since journalists went to the mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week’s agenda.
The first of these is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Sinaloa.
They also shed light on suspected government spending that took place in the hometown of the governor of the state.
There have also recently been several kidnappings at one of Culiacan’s most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor’s office.
Officially, no one has announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were wary when they were going to write about what every citizen of the city knows: that this restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the entire last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-ranking corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about past incidents at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaqu<0xC3><0xAD>n "El Chapo" Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n's sons escaped from an army intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about this topic in the Valdez section, which was the best source of information about the kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly have solved the case," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of bills and stickers for protests against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several billboards and went out the next morning to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor’s office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western state of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Only a burned body has been found, authorities say, based on DNA analysis, it's Adamea.
The activity of journalists is escalating across the country. Many of them organize protests and pat on the sidewalks and buildings "SOS press".
Director Bojorquez is on a day trip to Washington to seek international support and justice for Valdez’s death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa, which took place the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of tracking journalists and murdering them for telling the truth.
In the meantime, she asked to be transferred to another department, fearing that her anger might endanger her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are “deafened” by organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists are dying not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces working with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed more than half of all attacks on journalists by police officers and public officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Mac<0xC3><0xAD>as, which occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up because of my messages.”
Next to the severed head lay the keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to cease operations, such as the El Norte newspaper, which is based at the northern border of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breach.
Others continue to do so, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed drug cartels publicly with an article on the front page titled “What do you want from us”?
Some journalists have fled from their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who decide to stay and not give up their jobs, every day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
It’s Friday midnight and Riodoce’s employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office — the latest issue sent to the printer — drinking beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing.
It is reported that 19 people were killed in a gunfight between gang members and police near a beach resort in the city of Mazatlan.
The war is escalating, just as many of the messages left in this area by union members have promised.
Journalists publish this news from their mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a single day goes by and the opening title changes again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another shooting.
Bojorquez glances at the police patrol to see if they are paying attention.
If they are afraid, they don’t reveal it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their journal – whose middleman is the eloquent slogan for the whole of Sinaloa – all Riodoc employees follow in his footsteps.
"How could we think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however frightening.
Researchers have now uncovered the first findings of an amazing rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains — which experts have dubbed the ‘Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs’ — have been found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such an extent that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his scaly skin and stated that the dinosaur had a ‘problematic past’.
An article in the journal Current Biology said it was “the most preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
The fossil is a new species in the genus Nodosauridae. Dinosaurs lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition was literally shocked by the researchers, who described him with the words ‘really remarkable’.
The armored beetle is, according to National Geographic, the best-preserved fossil of its kind to date.
Behind the discovery is Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Canadian Alberta.
He stumbled upon something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to discover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
"Just blink your eyes a little and you'll believe he's asleep," said Caleb Brown, the head of the work and a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
“It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved species of dinosaur – the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore — despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank — was most likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system used by many animals today.
Experts say that it allowed him to blend better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of a 110-million-year-old dinosaur of the genus Nodosauridae first appeared in the paper in May. It is currently available for inspection at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelto markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shapes of scales and armor throughout the body.
They uncovered a method of masking commonly used by modern-day animals in defense – the top of the animal was darker than its bottom.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the findings of the researchers are surprising, because the size of Borealopelta far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
Thus, it is possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred masking over confrontation to survival.
Many modern-day mascots—such as deer, zebras, and or hares—are much smaller and also more vulnerable than prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to fight for its survivors literally.
"The predation of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur vividly illustrates the dangers that predators posed during the Cretaceous period," Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was likely reddish-brown in color.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for more information about its life, including the preserved stomach contents, to find out its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
Alberta had the same climate as Florida at the time, and rivers and oceans stretched much further inland than they do today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while being preserved in three dimensions so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as in the time of the Cretaceous.
You don’t have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just blink your eyes a little and it seems like you’re just sleeping.’
During the Cretaceous period, huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, were walking on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been a favorite prey of his equally terrible ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-metre-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt’s body was floated into the sea after being mummified in the mud.
Behind the discovery is Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from chin to hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
From his shoulders protruded two 50 cm axes.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of present-day Canada until it ended up in the river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept his body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, ‘finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning a lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the find seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side is his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her whole body.
A day after arriving in New York, a St. Louis parent sat on the bed in an Airbnb room and scrolled through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a contribution from a high school student.
"Police have just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
<0x40>TheePharoah constantly retweeted her wall posts.
A rapper from St. Louis tweeted about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old boy who was shot dead by a white-skinned police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying powerless on the street, where no one had taken him for four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
Death, however, was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her phone to come back to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign with the words "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son" in his hand!
She was watching live news — one of the policemen was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a lead in his hand and on his other end a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, held a gun in his hand, aimed at the crowd and shouted, “I’ll kill you all...animals.”
"That's not normal," Ferrell said to herself.
“This is not the kind of murder we’re used to and we can call normal.
I felt goose bumps all over my body.
“I was angry and I was crying.”
She immediately booked a return flight and the next day left for her home.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is described in a new documentary "Whose Streets?", which will be released in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and integrity told from the perspective of the people living in the community, who go out into the streets and ask for answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral shirt and the same floral earrings - about a topic they had discussed many times before - "about the experience with blacks".
“Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?” he recalls.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I didn't think I'd take it with me," Ferrell said later.
“Today’s events are the culmination... of what happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own skin, she is in no way different from any other black child-woman.
I feel that if I had protected her from this experience, I would have only harmed her.”
Upon arriving in Ferguson, the first stop on South Florissant Road was opposite the police department, which became the base of activists who expected police officer Darren Wilson's words about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who prepared food for others.
Together, they packed food in bags and helped spread it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell’s eyes, a new type of activism was slowly born.
"My activism turned upside down after August 9th," Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and was striving to introduce health care and food into Black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met the later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "only document" the events.
But Ferrell thought, "Are you working on a document or are you trying to find a story to use?"
This kind of skepticism penetrated into the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to make money on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected and that we wanted to change.”
Folayana has already partnered with co-director Damon Davis, a renowned local artist who deals with the topic of death row inmates.
His participation in the project also included Ferrell and six other locals who were followed by the Whose Streets team in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one is speaking for us in this document, but it is our statement," Davis said.
“It was important to me — how these people will be represented — because I will be represented in the same way.”
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about a rescue leader, but about bringing the community closer together," Folayana said - it turned out that she was the most open to participating in filming.
"Whose Streets?" describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how he fell in love with his wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face as she thought of the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
“But I understood that in order to do this job and polish the blacks, I had to open up.”
Ferrell’s story also highlights the role of an eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created a social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter in response to the 2012 killing of teenager Trayvon Martin - call themselves weirdos.
“Black eccentric women in leadership positions ultimately stand behind maintaining the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the brunt of these events.”
Folayana agrees with this statement, adding that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of eccentric black women."
However, she insists that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her views.
"It was she who was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
“That she was in the front lines is no coincidence, because life at these crossroads in the skin of a black weirdo woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, television station cameras have cleared their positions, but severe racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
She described the social-political atmosphere in the area she calls home as “Disorder.”
However, she does not stop in her efforts, which she has been committed to since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
“The only thing we can lose is our chains.”
There was a fire in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, and a helicopter helped.
Near <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod in Kol<0xC3><0xAD>nsk, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a field with an area of about 15 hectares burned from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, with firefighters declaring a third stage of a fire alarm out of four possible.
According to fire spokesman Ladislav Holom<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, the fire from the air helped to extinguish the helicopter.
At 18:00 firefighters managed to put out the fire, the fire caused damage for 700000 CZK.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical failure in the engine compartment of the combine.
Hasit was also assisted by a helicopter, which carried out a total of six water shocks.
"Instead of the intervention, we handed it over to the owner, until tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m. he will be guarded by a volunteer fire brigade," Holom<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and brown - hung from the ceiling on the wires, each of them as if it fell out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from mouthwashes and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized publication of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before he resigned as president of the United States.
Through an algorithmic analysis of Manning’s DNA and the use of 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, if not intellectual commentary on the susceptibility of DNA – as well as on the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted by such an identity – and a non-intelligible one.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken of herself as a woman since she was young, and was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including a violation of six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were detained by prison staff, and only one lower-quality black and white photograph was leaked to the public, on which Manning, visibly concerned, sat in the driver's seat in a platinum blonde wig, with which she is now associated.
In 2015, there were still positive reactions to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“They were planning an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complement the article with a portrait,” Dewey-Hagborg said at the opening of the new exhibition.
Visits and photography were not allowed, however, so they turned to Chelsea to ask if she was interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse met each other over the course of two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoila Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
In fact, a few days after the release of the comic, President Obama asked for Manning’s release, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition is taking place right at a time when Donald Trump is waging war with people who are seeking to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to incite resentment with his tweets in areas he should support.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything happens for some reason."
Under the artist’s statement on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter “i” in the name is sculpted by the heart) after the end of “self-serving factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture”.
On the opposite side are sequences of its mitochondrial DNA - centipedes of the letters C, G and A recorded by a pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"I hope people will take away from this that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it their own way," said Dewey-Hagborg. Her 2007 work Spurious Memories is also on the topic of video.
“DNA tells a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them.”
The last copy of the exhibition, placed in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emerging as King Kong from the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they stop you from speaking, they win," it says.
“Never let yourself be silenced.”
"It's a direct copy of one of the letters," said the Philadelphia artist.
"When I think about it, my goose bumps."
Manning has not yet personally attended the exhibition - as predicted in the comic - but when it does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genome-like images, sorted like a mob of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maninga, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"They were placed on the walls in the past, but this time I wanted to make them feel crowded," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and liberates her.”
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University wanted for murder
A nationwide search is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and Oxford University employees who are being prosecuted for suspected murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, he was arrested for the first-degree murder of a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to a Cook County court filing.
Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died from several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
When they arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the spot and detectives are investigating the case as murder, while police are looking for the two suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has been professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the university, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been barred from entering the university’s school premises.
“The whole matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them,” Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
A spokesman for Somerville University and Somerville College said in a statement sent by email: "We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the American police as well."
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were shocked by the whole thing and wished he would report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations at the Chicago Police Department, said he is calling on suspects to surrender to the relevant authorities.
"Police have information about their whereabouts and efforts to track down suspects are escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were supposed to take place in apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was not clear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were caught by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: “Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
Some of the criteria of the new plan have already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this in mind, WADA’s plan has been updated,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of WADA's plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutka, the code does not contain anything that should concern Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria, however, calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, about alleged sponsorship of doping by Russian athletes by the government.
Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been agreed upon.
However, there were no state programs in our country, so we cannot admit to something that never existed.”
Mutkov’s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russia’s RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but added: “On many occasions, we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of carrying out doping checks within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
The organization, however, allowed planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the organization’s Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was “on track” to resumption.
Police have charged three people, one of whom is a teenager.
Police have accused three men of setting up Wednesday's fire at a rare wooden church in T<0xC5><0x99>inci-Gutech in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>decko-M<0xC3><0xAD>stecka.
One of the defendants is a teenager, all three are Czech nationals.
They face up to 15 years in prison for a crime of general threat.
This is what Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el told reporters today.
He said it was an intentional crime.
"It's a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el said.
He said the police would discuss a possible arrest of the accused.
Further information according to the Director cannot be published.
"I can't say more yet, because the criminal police and investigation department and the prosecutor who oversees the case are actually working on the matter," Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el said.
The wooden church of the Body of God in Guta dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage is estimated to amount to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Shortly after the fire, consideration began to be given to rebuilding the church.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the additional costs are ready to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is expected.
A similar 16th-century wooden church of St. Catherine in Ostrava-Hrabové also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
This was caused by an electrical fault.
An exact copy was made in its place.
The state counts on the citizens in defense of the state.
It will support their training.
With financial support for associations useful in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of trainers, he calculates the objective of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state.
The Ministry of Defence, which has received the task of processing it from the government, promises that it will thus increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This is the result of a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns on defense support.
According to its authors, the main goal of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the exercise of defense duty and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the state would financially or materially support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would allow the capacity of their members to be increased.
In return, he would obtain data on people who are willing to come to the country in times of crisis, if necessary, and on their capabilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in training or training.
It also counts on organizing words with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One of the possible variants is that a new office would be created, which would be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state would use their capabilities only after the state of threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual eradication of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats," the report said, citing the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not only those of the military.
"The basic aim of the plan is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond competently to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, if necessary to contribute to the protection of others, and not to make it difficult for the Republic to carry out its tasks by misbehavior."
Adoption of the law would bring a lot of financial demands.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
Other money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that it would need to expand the scope of the regional military headquarters, which together would employ another 42 soldiers.
Representatives of the ministry have previously said that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of a European Union directive on gun ownership.
Its adoption would allow the shooters that will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons that the directive prohibits.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the employee satisfaction rate of her e-commerce startup, but she did not find a suitable survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the whole process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, owner of the San Francisco-based Madison Reed hair care e-commerce company, which employs 75 people.
She asked for help from outside.
New start-ups from the human resources sector are constantly appearing on the market, helping companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific purpose of measuring employee responsibilities, startups allow companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, and also offer complete employee anonymity and a hotline for filing complaints.
“There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she gained more awareness of what her employees think and feel in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a passing overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers - allowing the user to work on the fix.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the work environment - in case they become another Uber - which is frowned upon in scandals after a former employee posted on his blog a post describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who are open to bullying.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let’s Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Denver-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small surge in interest and activity earlier this year, just before the Uber scandals.
Almost 600 of Convertent’s customers include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has also recently taken over the board.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable “blitz” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints are sent directly to the Management Board.
“The Court of Public Opinion has regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of startup Convercent.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behavior — and if regulators do not intervene — it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotts, employee exhaustion, or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs more than 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses Convercent for more than a year to raise employees’ awareness of corporate policies and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to search the phone number or email to the company’s management, officially file a complaint, and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s deputy general counsel, who said there had been no reliable way to track employee complaints before.
Now that the company uses Convercent, it ensures quick detection and resolution of problems that have never before reached managers sitting in offices, miles away from the real solution to complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
“It comes close to a holistic, overall view of employee experience,” said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
“We are protecting shareholders from litigation on the part of employees.”
Companies stopped taking employee ethics, values, and participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed following Enron’s downfall over employee ethical rights abuses, Quinlan said.
But it wasn’t until “you’ve got the whole thing covered in social media,” that companies began to realize that in the online world they can’t just hide their skeletons in a closet.
“Before people started using technology to track ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity that is endorsed by the bold capital investors who have supported both startups.
As part of its February campaign, Convercent selected a total of $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and eventually raised $47 million in capital.
Glint earned $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of societies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of researches clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are not the main advantage.
Employees want to perceive that they are accepted and appreciated and that they dedicate their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“If people are happy at work, they feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of society,” said Nina McQueen, LinkedIn’s vice president of global benefits and employee benefits, which uses both Convert and Glint.
Investors make money when a company is successful and a company thrives when its employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market that ensures employee engagement and commitment to the company, it is no wonder that there are many investors who will support this effort.
According to occupational culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company requests feedback from its employees, there can be major changes.
And if the change does not occur quickly - at worst at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest of employees.
“Once you ask for 4,000 views, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies relying too much on the data itself.
“Because once you don’t get to the end of things, employees start asking themselves, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'"
Madison Reed, which now regularly conducts a survey of employees every month, is able to solve the problem in one day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by the slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday gains a very important view of its employees and hopes that in the long term it will achieve a high level of employment in the industry, which is known for its frequent layoffs.
“Unless you strive to create a transparent work environment, employees won’t trust you,” Vitrano added.
“And as soon as you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company fails.”
Thursday has become the warmest day.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic, with 38.3 degrees recorded in Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nica in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records.
Vedra hit mainly Moravia, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or leveled at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, in the Watchtower, today’s temperature was the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednica in the B<0xC5><0x99>eclav region today, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of degrees and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice in the Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with the Watchtower, came from 2013.
Today, high temperatures have occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nica, the biggest heat was in Dyj<0xC3><0xA1>kovice in Znojmo and Broda nad Dyj<0xC3><0xAD> in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk, where mercury rose to 37.8 degrees, but did not exceed the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the website of <0xC4><0x8C>HM<0xC3><0x9A>, the highest temperatures so far were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there started to rise only later in the afternoon," meteorologists said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>HM<0xC3><0x9A>, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually recede and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia and on Saturday.
We've got a lot of shit going on here.
Billionaires don’t have the same vote in the election as every adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as bold as Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penty owner Marek Dospiva, along with other water colleagues Martin Burda and Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Fry<0xC4><0x8D>, sponsors Robej<0xC5><0xA1>k’s Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also its chairman.
The convicted corrupt man and the king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, took over the Party of Private People.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project of Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>e was reluctantly named by the mayor of Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, Jaroslav N<0xC4><0x9B>mec, is a chapter in itself.
The mayors also recently caught their billionaires.
It is Dalibor D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, the owner of the security equipment company Jablotron.
In his own words, he enters politics in order to do good.
But the entrance in the mayor's jersey didn't work out very well for Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is to make the YES movement, to make the Mayor’s movement gain twenty percent in the elections.
Leckdo smiled.
Grandpa's renunciation, however, is rather characteristic.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of firm opinions.
Although he intends to apply for the votes of voters in the Mayors’ jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Grandpa supported Grandpa in the last parliamentary elections.
“Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is not a sharp-edged speaker, and he does not rule over the pleasant rhetoric of political snakes,” he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
He doesn’t want to go into politics because he wants to improve himself.
For me, Grandma will remain a hero.
He is willing to step out of his world, which he has under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the mayors presented him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babi<0xC5><0xA1> again.
And he said he wants the Mayors to learn to imagine possible cooperation with Grandma.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa doesn’t change his mind and is behind his no matter what jersey he’s wearing right now.
Others may speculate whether Babi<0xC5><0xA1> sends to the Mayors to build his bar for someone so uncool.
Others may ask if the Jablotron boss, for example, with the Agrofert boss, has broken up badly in the store and is looking for another way to defend his business rival.
But Grandpa's first public appearance was not just about Grandma.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard for anyone to put a stop to such a statement.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, a judiciary-recognized scoundrel, wasted millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, TOP 09 and the civil democrats came together to almost 30 million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
When Grandpa entered politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
You might not have to ask yourself why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
His first days in politics were crowned by the Grandfather with a proposal for a tax advantage for families with studied children.
The number of people with a university education is about 50,000 per month.
You're in your early twenties.
A man of fifty thousand is rich in the conditions here.
The one with the 20 poor.
In the Grandfather’s vision of society, the poor honestly pay taxes and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the welfare state, in which they do not participate very much.
In short, the rich need to be helped so that they do not plunder poverty with need.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babi<0xC5><0xA1> can shake hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm to ourselves that billionaires are not good people.
Then there is the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have the members and members of their party or the citizens and citizens of the state as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to pay 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often it will not help even 11 bedrooms, a magnificent sea view, or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump.
With the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
He reported on the website Mirror.co.uk.
The pamphlet says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Avoid a place like no other.
But even the association of the real estate company with the US president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean headquarters by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
The original price of the property was <0xC2><0xA3>21.5 million, the final price fell to <0xC2><0xA3>13 million.
Even after a discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The stunning 5 acre mansion on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
There is also a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the land.
From the terrace there is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers has manifested on the price.
Now the property is closer to the current property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about <0xC2><0xA3>15 million.
He was supposed to buy the property for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But with the new price, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at <0xC2><0xA3>13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end two training sessions a day. Long days are coming for the Bruins
The 11th of the morning is approaching, and UCLA football players are waving at the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal a sweaty back, a sure sign of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team members, these few minutes of nothingdoing is a noon break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for the finals before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place next morning at 6:30.
"The next three days are going to be a big one for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's game.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easier for players - paradoxically, training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That’s why the first three UCLA training sessions are scheduled at 19:15 – to fit into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora has spent as a coach in Westwood, the Bruins start training camp a week earlier than last year, and training is limited for the summer semester, with a decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one per day.
A total of 18 training sessions are scheduled for August 20, with formal preparations starting for the first game against the Texas A&M team in September.
Mora has been heard to support the NCAA's decision, despite adding an additional item to the already-loaded players' diary.
“Three or four days are stressful for the players and it’s very exhausting for them,” Mora said.
"But no one gave up, they're all trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the training camp ends, which will not be easy when looking at the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center hotel, which was occupied by players after harvesting the protective net behind the goalpost.
The Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when rooms become empty during the season, a problem could arise.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it’s not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our workouts.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking lot No. 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe everything will be fine.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook Plans Deeper Fact Check to Reduce Counterfeit News
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties and display findings under the original posts in an effort to fight so-called “fake news,” the largest social network said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the Company states that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which will send third parties to verify and potentially display the survey results under the original posts.
Facebook has been cited as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year’s election of the President of the United States.
Political debates are raging across Europe, with French voters flooded with false reports of the May presidential election, and Germany planning to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of the September elections if it does not swiftly remove its anger.
Facebook said in a statement Thursday that it was about to launch testing of a new fake news check feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying third-party-verified messages, people are asking for more content to be better informed and to be able to make the right decision about what they can share,” Sara Su, Facebook’s product news manager, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake messages.
The Making of a Graphic Novel: The Story of A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the music video for the band Squeeze, and Margaret Thatcher took refuge in it during the 70s and 80s of the last century.
Scotney, however, witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy spot on the Bewl River in British Kent, inspiring the curly Jamie Rhodes of York County – known for his fondness for historical documents – to create a graphic novel.
“Looking at the writing of a man who is 300 years after his death fascinates me,” Rhodes says with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection.”
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of British Library-inspired documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
“I was struck by a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites,” he said.
"That's his fingerprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
I love the archives!”
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to spend almost four months at the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on the wall and bottles that had been thrown into the ditch for centuries.
He walked around the land, exploring the ruins of the old castle, talking to the landlords, gardeners, and occasionally also with the artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night, he drank whiskey and sang.
The confidential history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained access to documents in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived on the scene ten years later, the employees were only beginning to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words, as if “the aristocrats of many centuries were throwing their hands at the words: ‘Take it to the attic.’”
Diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps depicting property: "You may think the dispute over land is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were dragging on a birch.
Let go of those people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and dig deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English uprising of 1381.
“I found a record of a rebellion at a castle in 1380, which was called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book,” Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought the uprising was a good starting point.
Maybe they have something to do with each other in the end.”
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest, whom Darrell's family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was only discovered a few years after the coffin was discovered).
Rhodes's favorite family is the Darrells: "I was fascinated by the male generation - the men of that time were always indebted and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
The different generations of the Darrells dealt with it by marrying rich or old ladies - I imagine they were the handsome gentlemen who liked to wave their heads at the heirs."
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes searches for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book on Elämämäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was absorbed by nature.
This is a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I was like, 'Now I'm going to go back to real life.'"
Washington changes the terms of the Green Card
President Donald Trump’s words about a new U.S. immigration plan that will also change the way the green card is issued are published in the media.
It is estimated that the number of legal immigrants will decrease by 50,000 per year as a result of stricter rules for granting temporary work visas and family visa restrictions.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we will achieve this by changing the rules of issuing green cards to people in other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will be preferred by English-speaking applicants, who will be plentiful in funding and demonstrate capabilities that will benefit our country," Trump said.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be vigilant
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sex robots appears on the Internet.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are very popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to former Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the warts and the appearance of the nails of the robot.
“People are squeamish about them, but sales are growing, and we need to be prepared to see them more and more,” Sharkey said.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable pantyhose to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can "adjust" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the warts to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it is very worrying that many robots have their own “personality” that would also embarrass Stepford’s mistress.
Modern inflatable virgins evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his replacement wife various character traits, including shyness.
And then there’s True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold sex robot woman, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including “frigid Farrah,” who is characterized by shyness and “wild Wendy” with “adventure” nature.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is set to be as personal as possible,” says the True Companion website.
He likes what you like and vice versa.
She's in a mood, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or “in a mood.”
The rise of sex robots is alarming for a number of reasons - not to be confused with real interpersonal relationships - but rather substandard female character traits and violent hints - such as frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
The company True Companion on its website resembles Roxxxy as a vibrator for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can’t a man have Roxxxy?”
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or sexual aid.
Their creation and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift from ideal or gender equality towards a desire for compelling sex with an optional surcharge.
Of course, most men don’t buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of the public’s interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set in the present modern era.
And most people aren’t weird or violent until the free market makes a pretext for them.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are gaining their rights, and in the White House sits a president who is often very shy about women.
The most horrifying aspect of the series The Story of the Maid is not what we see - hung bodies and pricked eyes, rather the reality of these visions.
The Servant's Story is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems like a small step.
Sex robots should look as much as possible like real women (even with the size of a porn star).
Their creators construct them so that they are pleasant to the touch and appear at first sight like a real woman.
However, when it comes to their “personality,” the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can’t break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job, no history, nothing that would encourage their independence or undermine their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
The 21st Century: Servants.
The NBA star on the green armrest.
Curry fights in California for a cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose despite a messy first shot at the premiere among professional golfers.
The double-time NBA Player of the Year award winner played a Web.com tour of California’s Hayward in the Ellie Mae Classic Lower Series, the first round of 74 runs, and will fight for the cut.
Golden State, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started off very nervously and his first kick-off ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate between the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left behind a dozen professionals with a balance of four strokes over the pair.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first shot, but then he sat down a little," Curry said with a huge tremor.
It was very nervous to kick off the first shot at the tournament, but that was all I had hoped for.
“If you told me I would play 74 in the first round, I would take it immediately,” he added.
If Curry manages to fight a cut that is likely to be set two times under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've gotten rid of the tremor, I hope I can," said a golfer who has played in the past in celebrity tournaments and mixed amateur and professional competitions.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
Ellie Mae Classic received a sponsorship exemption and retained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
A sure sign of the Trump era are political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro scale, tear families apart.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving periods, the American newspapers were full of advice on how to deal with relatives who elect Trump.
We're supposedly just waiting for her nerves to let us in.
However, less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to tame the family.
I’m talking about it because this week in New York my cousin, a poet and a left-wing fan, who lives in Chicago and has been paying for a Republican fool in our family for a long time, visited me.
She reminded me that being united in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden, the whole family — including all of the Republican siblings she’s been hanging out with about politics for years — is on the same wave.
Dinner at the family table is a good thing; but it strikes me that in a broader context it poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the frightening possibility that his sluts may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly become the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these days, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of insane behavior - a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both examples of which look very mild compared to Trump.
After Trump’s departure, it will be enough to make a subsequent Republican candidate at least normal, which will be a tremendous improvement.
We took my cousin’s visit and took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel running the New York Parks Department – you won’t find a better use for your three dollars if you don’t need caffeine.
Horses are huge, the central cylinder is covered in glass - clowns and animals shoot and look at their own shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy look and zinc music strangely resembles public transport.
Many clichés will soon fade away: the view from high-rise buildings, the panorama looks back, instead of being breathed by the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn't get carried away by the fact that Swiss Cottage is not really Swiss cheese - not counting the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but a subway station in London.
However, the bike in Central Park evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, will have a great time on it.
If I could rate the carrot, it would be worth the maximum points, but luckily no one asks.
This week I had a similar experience in the store when I was asked to rate my “experience” on a scale of one to five when paying with a credit card.
In the cafe on the corner of my street it's the same, with the difference that I can give a rating of 15% for something I buy at the counter.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is thus forced to rub herself into the favor of shoppers when it’s not needed.
The woman in the store apologised to me with a smile when I reluctantly evaluated my credit card handover with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to his wrist, which he had caused himself after falling into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing against the original conviction for murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of a toilet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken her for a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they said was too mild.
The National Prosecution Authority said it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius could be sentenced to up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive-bred panda spawned in the wild.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The Center is trying to expand the genome fund of pandas kept in captivity.
An employee of the Chang Cheng Center told the New China Agency that the breeding of pandas is at great risk due to the interbreeding of relatives.
There were only 471 pandas in captivity at the end of last year.
Only two thousand of them survive in the wild.
Trying to pair captive pandas with wild pandas is the first step in helping to protect the species.
The 15-year-old Cchao-cchao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the pandi mating period on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, the scientists were able to observe every step of it.
She met her chosen one, Cchao-cchao, 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males quite poorly estimate the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegally camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were arrested on August 1 in the morning by Sithonian police.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules for free camping and impose strict fines on anyone who is caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
The checks will take place throughout the season.
The court said the court could impose a fine.
Spilkov<0xC3><0xA1> is in fifth place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Kl<0xC3><0xA1>ra Spilkov<0xC3><0xA1> is ranked 50th after the first round of the British Open Major.
The pitch at Kingsbarns, Scotland, was scoring one underscore when she played three birdies and two bogeys.
The twenty-two-year-old Czech player is so hopeful that for the first time she will go through a cute at the famous major.
A $3.25 million grant was awarded to Michelle Wieva, who won the first round of the record-breaking 64 runs, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are pulling millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Authority (NVWA) said it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry, which it said meant that 80 percent of the eggs on the market were safe.
The Authority emphasised that the risk represented only a limited number of egg types recognizable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also agreed to close the farms, have not been brought to the Czech Republic lately.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets problem marks of insecticide have appeared.
Eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in May, according to the veterinary administration.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of flea, all-purpose and tick medicines.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is eaten by humans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says Goalkeeper Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek looking for engagement.
I'd like to take 10 more years.
"Maybe I'll come back one day," laughed the 27-year-old Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who could start the season in a Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n jersey.
It depends on whether you get a commitment before the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like school, it would be three.
The first year I didn’t catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I've been studying.
The second year I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I alternated again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch it all the time.
But in the first ten games, we only scored five points, so the coaches started to turn it around.
In the end, my colleague caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play him for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Gorgeous.
It is a small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss her.
I found a girlfriend there.
It's our third year together, and we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is KHL for goalkeepers?
The first 10 teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slav who have to change their playing style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the pitch.
The difference is that the Russians want to play in the void.
Fewer shots, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have trouble traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, that's no problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually done by playing four matches outside and then having two days off.
How do Latvians feel about their club in KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
Everybody's a fan.
Even though it didn't work out, a lot of people walked.
Did Dinam’s performance in the KHL help Latvia to almost advance to the quarterfinals at this year’s World Cup?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since then, their results at the World Cup have started to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell just 1–2 in the quarterfinals with Canada.
That was an unbelievable result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they have reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
In Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n, Roberts Bukarts prevailed and before the signing of the contract is Ralfs Freibergs.
Why do so many people come here?
They're not beer players, they're really good quality.
The local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still not engaged?
At the beginning of February I knew that I would not continue in Riga.
That's when we started looking for something.
There was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for goalkeepers, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the final they decided on someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and I'll wait for something to show up.
Aren't you nervous about that?
That's what I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am at home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where to sign.
How realistic is the possibility that you will start the new year in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens next month, where it's going to go.
Now I can just wait for the agent to make a deal.
Do you prefer a competition?
The last season wasn’t for me to choose from.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's takeover of Let continues.
In January of this year, I wrote in the article S caring for a proper farmer? about the camp in Lety near Orl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so let me remind you of the key passages of the article.
There has been talk of a summer camp for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what it is, it will probably be best if they look at the official site of the cultural monument Pietn<0xC3><0xAD> v<0xC4><0x9B>tn<0xC3><0xAD> Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical survey, we learn that the camp stood two kilometres east of Lety, that it served as a labour camp from 8 August 1940, that it was a collection camp from 1 January 1942, and that it became a gypsy camp from 2 August 1942.
The following text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first summer prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense sufferings of human beings, which in turn caused them by human beings and perverse ideology.
There is no dispute that it is necessary to constantly remember these events.
Nor is it disputed that this commemoration should take place at a memorial in the place of the suffering experienced by these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s pigs were built nearby and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised the purchase and demolition of pork, but so far this has not happened.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Monument.
In July 2013, the U.N. Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pork market.
So many very brief facts about the camp's post-war fate.
Only in the autumn of last year, the government approved the purchase of pork and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy pigs.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "there are some numbers, but I would probably be spoiling those intentions if I went public with them."
We’ll see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it will not be a cheap thing.
And yet just a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, to the modification of which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was beautifully funded by the UN Committee on Human Rights, which apparently does not threaten, it would, in my opinion, be equally a waste of money.
Doesn’t the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified place of worship, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that has taken place, and anyone who wishes can bow to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change that!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the piety place with the utmost care.
The property entrusted, i.e. the money of the taxpayers, should be handled by the responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, with the care of the proper economic operator.
At least, like in your own company.
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But I still perceive from the point of view of the above mentioned facts the slogan of the leader of the YES movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
In May of this year, I went to see the place.
Very decent driveway, well-maintained parking, replicas of wooden camphouses.
In one exposure, in the second integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own pedestal, which is made of stones located in a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as they look and belong.
Archaeological research is currently taking place at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, it would be impossible to preserve some of the exposed foundations and at least make them visually accessible in an appropriate way.
Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could make his efforts in this direction.
If he succeeds in enforcing the purchase of pork for state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already rather problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 patients in the U.K., causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to consume meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to build immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
The head of the study, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the removal of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
Once the bowls of the scales tilt to the side of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells that support the body’s tolerance in the stomach of mice with a specific bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We found a link between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support the body's tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more these immune cells they had.”
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then a combination of L. reuteri bacteria and tryptophan-rich diets would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory gut environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice kept separately the cells were missing.
Inferred from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that commonly reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of mice were tested by DNA sequencing, and the researchers found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the second group of mice lacked.
Mice that were bred in a sterile environment and lacked intestinal microbiomes -- they didn't develop this type of immune cell -- were given the L. reuteri bacteria and formed immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultivated L. reuteri in the fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid — without the bacteria — to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the liquid, it has been shown to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After splitting the doses of tryptophan, at the same time, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us retain L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri bacteria cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably strive for the development of these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase cell population."
Jose Mourinho considers signing a contract with Nemanj Mati<0xC4><0x87> and his transfer to Manchester United ‘genius’
Manchester United have won their "genius" team in the form of Nemanja Mati<0xC4><0x87> - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's game against Sampdoria.
Mati<0xC4><0x87>, who signed a <0xC2><0xA3>40m contract, made his first 2-1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Mati<0xC4><0x87> had no form and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, must be worked on before the start of the next season of the Premier League.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, he's intelligent and he's got a brilliant mindset - he's thinking football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Mati<0xC4><0x87>, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his eleventh for the next season.
An independent source this week announced that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists the club has done a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
“Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they did the best they could for me.”
The Life Challenge of the King of Chickens, Lady Pear.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This promising picture began to draw thanks to the new program on TV Prima Zdenek Academy.
The pear immediately blew the chance.
"Dear Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k, I would like to apply to your cooking academy with this, because I think I can learn a lot from you, hand to heart," he said in a video on social media.
And since the two of them have been peaking for several years, L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xB0>a did not forget to irritate him even this time.
"In return, I can teach you a diet of chicken, American cucumber, or I can invite you to the water and show you why fried cheese is a favorite," Pear said.
He is really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up the level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what's the boss to do with it?" he said to Blesk.
Pohlreich did not comment, however, because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, boss!.
Only Prima reacted to Pear’s participation in the culinary academy by taking the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
In December 2004, Hruska Pohlreich received her first job as a chef.
In a few days it sold more than 300,000 pieces!
The new show, which Prima presented at a press conference yesterday on the autumn broadcast scheme, is a non-falsified cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from among the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve pieces.
In the last part of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014, Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k had a crossed pear ironed on the back of his t-shirt.
If he had my face there, I would have laughed a lot.
"I'm just laughing at the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xB0>a said.
He thinks of L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x91>e's culinary art.
"Cooking according to Lady Pear does not come into consideration even at home, because I will not let gastropunk at home," the boss is clear.
I respect Pohlreich very much, even according to him I make chicken on honey.
But in my show, his recipes will definitely not appear," Parrot did not forgive himself.
He's a jerk!
He's not a cook to me, he's a television clown.
"A gastronomic illiterate or a fool," Pohlreich said of Pear in one lecture.
"I'm not in my twenties to wave my hand over them, but I don't deal with them like that either," Pear said.
British inventor uses microchip in his hand to unlock the car and house by wavering
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. With a simple swipe of his hand, he can unlock the door of the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-year-old Steven Northam has had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
The procedure for implantation and adherence to medical procedures is supervised by Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
The Northam company also offers a door lock and car replacement service, compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is <0xC2><0xA3>300.
The married father of one child let the technology integrate into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple swipe of his hand.
White House props cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for the celebration of the U.S. manufacturing industry last month came to $24,000, according to naval records released by the weekly TIME.
The Green White Helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as the Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the culmination of the July 17 White House program, which was a parade of U.S. construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials watched a show of products from all 50 states.
A Connecticut helicopter was on display next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklift.
A military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the helicopters responsible
“I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event,” HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Navy’s deputy commander for aviation, the day before the event began.
The report suggested that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. for the occasion of the parade, which is scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. and will remain on site until the complete clearing of the entire site, which was scheduled between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.
The e-mail further stated that if there is a delay in leaving the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to working time regulations.
The original crew remained on site that evening, along with the helicopter and the security personnel.
From the records - obtained by the weekly magazine TIME - it was not apparent whether the second crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prohibits government officials from using government assets for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was in order," the commander wrote.
'It sounds like you're being blocked, 'said the deputy commander.
This “Made in America” show was designated by the White House as an official event, so the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even the official events have political subtexts.
While attending the event, the president advocated a health reform that was passed by the Senate and talked about trying to keep the government regulation under control.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence purely for presentational reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane flew in the background at his first meeting as part of the campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ show, which showcased products from all 50 states that Americans make from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, a spokeswoman for the White House.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington area and on the South Lawn and practice any arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump took part in the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the current crew training, the official said.
On the same day, the helicopters flew within the framework of “non-presidential support missions” for another eleven hours.
The White House said no additional requisites were paid from taxpayers’ money.
Sikorsky said the company was not in any way interested in negotiations to expose the helicopter to South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the parade is difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, reimbursement of DoD expenses for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records time 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico, Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below the stated amount.
“Indicating the costs of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenses is very misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs.”
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursements do not include staff costs, but include fuel prices, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopters for the purpose of the parade.
"The idea of the show taking place this week is to introduce products made in the U.S.," Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to the defense of our state and to provide work for hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military facilities that countless American citizens are involved in.
This fact is to be remembered.”
It is not clear if Trump was also looking at the helicopter during his visit to South Lawn. With certainty, it can only be said that he was behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump addressed a Sikorsky representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I own three myself."
A young woman was stranded in a swamp near M<0xC3><0xA1>ch's lake, police rushed to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday about two o'clock in the morning.
Instead of bathing, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask the police for help using her mobile phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Bal<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Several police patrols set off to the place she described, but finding a young woman was not at all easy.
"Some of the policemen had to sail hundreds of meters through the reed moss before they could feel the solid ground under their feet again," Bal<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
And, like that, she was missing.
The police were oriented according to which direction her call for help was based.
"In order not to at least lose this connection, they agreed with her that she would count down aloud," the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman in three out of five swamps in Born<0xC3><0xBD>.
She was on the brink of physical and mental strength, showing signs of undercooling.
Therefore, the summoned ambulance transported her to the Czechoslovak hospital.
Grandpa's connection to STAN?
The bride-to-be becomes a saleswoman.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project seekameslusny.cz as if a billionaire were basically telling voters that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
And he also asserted that a politically incompatible party of lesser-known mayors and independents, in fact, does not have a nationwide program for parliamentary elections.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, regardless of any political opinion.
Once upon a time, V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta started out like this, and it didn't go very well.
With his quest for decent people and personalities, which may be replaced by some mayors on the candidates, which Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k admitted, Grandfather also cancels the popular argument of the head of the STAN that the greatest value of the movement is political scrutiny and the experience of the mayor, traditionally the most popular politicians.
They are now quietly replacing the quickly collected unknown personalities.
Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k explained the total split with the people, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, also by the fact that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if only a few people suspected STAN of identity at that time, after the arrival of Grandpa, the simple game of identity ends.
Not only had Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k long defined himself against the YES of Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but on the first joint press conference, the Grandfather, who publicly praises the YES, stated as follows: "My goal is that the YES movement, that is, the Mayor's movement, gains twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't mess up the move.
Grandpa is a successful businessman, and a billionaire certainly isn’t a coincidence.
He often talks about politics in the same way as Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has been reminiscent of a reality show for some time now rather than a real political party, and D<0xC4><0x9B>dko’s helping hand seems to be making a sales girl even more of the bride-to-be.
For some time STAN went with TOP 09, then with the people and now for change is looking for decent people.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police Dogs Trained in Bridge by Helicopter
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and search dogs today practiced by Lake Bridge by helicopter.
The police dog must not be fearful and afraid of flying, said Petr Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of police cynologists in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At the bridge, both adult dogs and those who are just undergoing training were trained.
In addition to standard training, in which they were supposed to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for a lost figurant, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter arrives, the dog can go to work, so that he does not have a problem with the helicopter's journey.
"The helicopter arrives, the dog goes and immediately looks for it," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
A dog that is restless or is unable to start working immediately after the helicopter journey is expelled from training.
"Most of the time they keep them for example for the garden," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The police have 76 dogs with different specializations in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region.
German shepherds are predominant, but Belgian shepherds are also growing.
The dog owner takes care of him from the puppy.
"He raises it himself, he prepares it for the service that the dog will do for us," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which can reveal possible health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, it passes the first tests in 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years for a sharp intervention," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The length of service to the police depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
They usually live with their dogs.
Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of Netflix hit series
Despite the end of the second season of Narcos, when the killer of Pablo Escobar is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
Confirmation by the streaming service has already reached the third and fourth seasons - the first one has already reached the first trailer and the cast of other negative characters.
In Season 3, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential patrons, they operate “as a Fortune 500 company,” only with the difference that they escalate violent acts and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays brain surgery, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, a character who recruits American and Colombian drug rights defenders.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
The elections can only be credible if they are attended by all members of the society, including women, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the U.N. Auxiliary Mission, said that hundreds of women are participating in local elections, three women are applying for the post of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if they are also attended by women, as well as all related processes related to elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on April 5.
The Taliban has issued several threats against the electoral process, which shifts international combat activities to the second round.
For the first time in this year’s elections, a democratically elected government is handing over its power peacefully to the next government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women will strengthen the democracy of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that out of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The unique brewery once again brews beer.
For a good beer to the resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners came back to life a few years ago at the brewery in Lob<0xC4><0x8D>a near M<0xC5><0xA1>en.
The brewery mentioned for the first time in 1586 has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was converted to steam engine operation.
It was followed by years of flourishing, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during World War II, production was halted and the brewery was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have been used as state property.
The work of destruction was done by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned site was devastated and dismantled for building material.
In 2007, however, there was new hope in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov<0xC3><0xBD>.
They began repairing the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have carefully devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same shape as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded with the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the building has also become part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was renewed.
If you want to taste a great skull beer in the picturesque landscape of Koko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, visit the stopover in the brewery area.
When brewing beer here they use coconut water springing in the protected landscape area, malt from the skull fields and <0xC5><0xBD>ateck<0xC3><0xBD> hops.
You will taste the traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And do not miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at half past two.
The largest artillery fortress of Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest forts of its kind on a global scale?
The Stachelberg Fortress between Trutnov and <0xC5><0xBD>aclé<0xC5><0x99>e, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Bab<0xC3><0xAD>, was to be such a unique building.
Originally, it was supposed to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by extensive underground.
There were supposed to be headquarters, barracks, ammunition warehouses, materials, power plant, machine shop and hospital.
The construction was completed by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive iron-concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken up.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who in the early 1990s began to reconstruct the unique building, you can also visit here.
The underground is already accessible from 75 percent!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry shed with exposition and underground, there is also an armed light fortification object, as well as two mounted infantry sheds, trenches and the Fortified Trutnovsko educational trail.
Refreshments, cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and splendid Czech building has been added to the list alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Trajan's Port near Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimrod.
Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged convent building above a beautiful garden.
The list he got, but unfortunately belongs to the unique buildings that are in danger of extinction.
Enthusiasts, however, do not want to give up and organize a lot of events in support of the monastery.
One of them is another annual Evening for Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery this Saturday, August 5, where Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Mi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>k, Ivan Hlas, will perform, you will see swordsmen's performances and look at the places of beautiful large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
But above all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look the Neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Anthropos pavilion of the Moravian Land Museum in Brno attracts an unusual excursion into the deepest prehistoric period, into the world of our predecessors.

Get to know the plant in one click.
The new free application Pl<0x40>ntNet will help students with the creation of herbalists as well as ordinary plant lovers.
If they are interested in what plant they just came across on a walk, this app will advise them.
The only thing they will have to do is take a photo of the plant and the application will recognize for itself what kind it is.
The new application, which is available for iOS and Android, was introduced on Tuesday by representatives of the Center for Ethical and Environmental Education CEEV in the Bratislava Mountain Park as part of the project The Secret Life of the City.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also took part in the project, photographing and adding plants from their surroundings with teachers to the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download on the site Secret Life of the City.
The main goal of French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
“Children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest,” said project coordinator Ivana Pol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit of a plant, the application can recognize its name in a few seconds, which it then assigns under the photo in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the project Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute a picture of a plant that is not yet in the database after creating an account in the app.
"The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial, and then add it to the database," Pol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
Trade unions are demanding assurances from managers of biscuit manufacturer McVitie's of a long-term commitment to manufacturing at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company was still silent on possible investments in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 employees, who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that employees and trade union representatives will be "among the first to be informed" in the event of changes to the factory's operations.
In a letter to the company’s builder, GMB’s Scottish trade unions expressed concerns that McVitie’s “will not get its promises of financing and modernization of production lines.”
Drew Duffy, GMB’s chief organizer, added: “The fact that we have not received a clear response from the builder regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan at Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working at the local factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
From the point of view of work, wages and benefits – and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising cost of living and declining slow production – the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately thriving producer like McVitie’s.”
A Pladis spokeswoman said: “The Tollcross construction manager received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives at Tollcross took place two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in Tollcross, particularly in production lines and operational efficiencies.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the local area, and in the event of any changes to the operation of the factory, employees and trade union representatives will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow in its attempt to win Neymar to its side after depositing <0xC2><0xA3>189 million, the amount needed to redeem Neymar from the contract, but warned this French team to Barcelona about its record-breaking raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer has unleashed the waters of summer transfers. Ligue 1 is ready to surpass more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogba's transfer to Manchester United, who paid <0xC2><0xA3>89 million for him last season.
Upon confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and at the same time the world’s highest paid professional athlete – after taxes, he will collect over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar has withdrawn from his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to satisfy Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world aware of this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned any club that would be interested in overcoming one of PSG's best players.
“I’m not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we’re definitely going to address one of their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the imaginary line when it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that under no circumstances will it allow the departure of the Italian representative, so it is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for its bold actions with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understandable rules?
Donald Trump nodded at the anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China is doing nothing with the North Korean threat, and that it will not continue to do so.
Even that clears the thought of sanctions like a straw from shoes.
These things can't be thrown in one bag.
Maduro’s Venezuela has really set out on the road to dictatorship, to totalitarianism.
China is not doing what the U.S. president wants it to do.
Russia is a chapter to itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even the ordinary voter, American, European or otherwise, understands what it is and what system of rules is based on the policy of sanctions, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump only extends what President Obama has already agreed to, only gives it an implementation stamp.
Then why such a fuss?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the US election, it would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not loosened, they are tightened.
Europe is even more frightening.
German Minister Zypries says Trump’s sanctions violate international law.
Is kosher just a sanction approved by the U.N. Security Council?
But then there is neither kosher nor anti-Russian sanctions of the EU.
European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump’s sanctions threaten the EU’s energy security.
Is it as if sanctions are to be used only so weakly that they do not threaten anyone?
The regular voter beats.
For three years, he heard that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Minsk agreements on truce in Ukraine.
Now he learns that it is the EU's energy security.
The electorate is getting bigger and bigger.
Sanctions are imposed on Russia because it mounts too much where it does not.
China is stunned by the fact that it mounts little.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country’s borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the order, or the rules in it?
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I am not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is married, crosses the Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, he has all the candidates ready.
According to his words, he did not interfere with them significantly.
He even agreed to be led by the Moravian-Silesian leader and shadow education minister Ivo Vondr<0xC3><0xA1>k.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member of parliament or a cheerleader," Babi<0xC5><0xA1> said.
You have angered many representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
That's not how it was.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we are directly electing the president, and I am convinced that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about disturbing representatives, they can be there.
The question is how many there will be.
In the presentation of your book What I Dream About When I Accidentally Sleep, I heard in my own ears that you were talking about the abolition of representations.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about the direct election and the reduction of the number of representatives.
New York City, with nine million people, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is blamed for not building much and not preparing big projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government that has only been ruled by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which I'm not saying they did well.
The current prime minister is not directing anything, he is only moderating the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to enforce.
We only have a one-round election to the Senate in the program.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the Rules of Procedure of this House to prevent unnecessary exhibitions by Members, who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to appear in the meetings of this House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the House with 101 deputies, abolish the counties and the Senate, and control the whole country through grateful mayors and mayors.
I'm sure it's not.
After all, there is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron announced the reduction of the legislature by a third, while there is a single legislature of 57,000 French, while in our country it amounts to 17,000 Czechs.
But no one blames Macron for endangering democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the elections by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
The arguments for those who have a parliamentary majority, however, are large, it is enough to look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing as a YES movement.
We just need a team that will work in government for the people, not for their parties or resorts.
I do not understand why we have not been able to agree that the salaries of teachers, cultural workers and social services will only be increased.
Why did they override me and add 21 percent to the GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Would you have thought of that as a prime minister?
The prime minister is set to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse government with travel agencies, and for state money would like to do business like Marian Jure<0xC4><0x8D>ka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not to argue in government, contradictions are to arise outside of it.
The cabinet must have ready-made material, there is no room for coalition rifts, force voting and tricks, there must be a decision.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers are mostly party-oriented?
There is a constitutional law on the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said the coalition treaty was not valid, and expelled Babi<0xC5><0xA1> from the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
However, if he is a personality and has management skills, such a planned gesture is not necessary.
It measures everyone the same and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would propose to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, because we probably won't be in that government, no one wants to work with us, even if I don't know what I've done so terrible.
There is no such thing as skepticism.
The mayors have acquired the businessman D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, who would like to work with you, perhaps the wing of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC4><0x8C>unk will win with the people.
I don't think so.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is led by Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek, who does not exclude the coalition with the ANO, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus, Jr., who will not be against the ODS.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many common points with SPD Tomio Okamura, for example in the area of economy.
So the Occams come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it like that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet of V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta for VV, then he obtained money from <0xC3><0x9A>svjet for his company, there was a coup.
He is, of course, a prominent figure.
Of course, she's a little brown.
If I take his program, then there is a wide involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, you can agree with that.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you, speaking at demonstrations with sticks and wants to leave the EU?
We are not considering cooperation with Mr. Okamura's side, I can't imagine it.
Clearly, he went into politics to profit from it.
And what about the silent support of the Communists for your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in a row, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the duo.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let’s go back to your efforts to run the state as a company.
But the government just has to run, Prime Minister Sobotka has let everything go, he has never decided.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
As soon as he did, CEZ dominated the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the management of CEZ, which imposes on the Minister of Finance how to vote at the general meeting of CEZ.
If you were to become prime minister, would you change the personnel situation on the supervisory board and change the top management of CEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm prime minister, we'll see.
I'm not eating yet.
It is rumored that CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
A good cooperation with <0xC4><0x8C>SSD would like to exchange for an even better one with YES.
After the election, everything will go on again.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any Humble Lobbyists or Roses, I'm a separate unit and I'm not dealing with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to replace the leadership of CEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, the institutions that you criticize?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he has been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look at Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in CEZ, it never drove it, it was there only in numbers, which is wrong.
It is a trivial matter to me.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, shove them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocs is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her shows against me run a permanent purpose campaign, but I don't have and won't have any competence to discard anyone.
But to control, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about $7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?
After all, the Chamber approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the Directors-General of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
Look at how these reports are being discussed, about the super power pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigation files and to lex Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he was forced by Kalousk to throw me out of the government, which earned the TOP 09 percentage, but the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD took them away.
They fear the disruption of their corrupt system, and so they speak of a threat to democracy by Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first vice-president of ANO, Jaroslav Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek, builds up the power base by placing his son on the supervisory board of Tepl<0xC3><0xA1>ren Brno and establishing a contract with a related lawyer, Kv<0xC4><0x9B>toslav Hl<0xC3><0xAD>n, with municipal and state-owned companies such as the Czech Republic’s Prague Dover?
We have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I blamed it on him a few times.
Fal<0xC3><0xBD>nek argues that the aforementioned lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As finance minister, I didn’t have anyone.
We, unlike the Socans, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, Kratochvilova, Brezina.
If there was any indication of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like that happens, we'll get rid of anyone, no matter who they are.
