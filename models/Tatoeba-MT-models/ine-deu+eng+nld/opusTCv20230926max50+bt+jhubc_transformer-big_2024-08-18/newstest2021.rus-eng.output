The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10,000 people will be assisted, including rescuers, National Guard fighters and the military.

Semilarski v. Prosecutor's Office: the cassation of the former vice-mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that the decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances to consider the lawsuit Semilarski refused, but in April his cassation complaint was accepted in the proceedings of the State Court.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its permission does not fall within its jurisdiction of the Administrative Court.
The court's decision stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damages caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
“The prosecutor’s office and the district court should regulate such issues,” said Tartu Courts spokeswoman Annette Kreitsmann.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State will have to say its word.
According to Semilarsky’s lawyer, Oliver Nyas, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now demands that the prosecutor ' s office refute false allegations against him and compensate him for the moral damage.
The reason for the complaint to the court was the statements made by the prosecutor for special cases of the Lyuna District Prosecutor's Office Margus Gross in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with the then Vice Mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov, was arrested on suspicion of committing several crimes.
“When I was arrested, the Security Police and the Prosecutor’s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu – one of the most influential bodies of local self-governments – are being sold.
These public suspicions in the air have been with me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor’s office does not want to say anything about it,” Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyaes, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should operate.
“The allegations of bribery and bribery turned out to be false, but that’s not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, the representatives of the state must be careful when choosing words so that suspects are not presented as criminals before the sentence is handed down.
The prosecutor’s office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” he said.
"The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and a briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being ascertained is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair in relation to the statement."
According to rus.err.ee, former deputy mayor Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery – the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of deliberately violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions of particularly large size.
According to the indictment, in the period from 2015 to 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the meetings of the city administration in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated at the personal level.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to refrain from participating in the decision-making.
Previously, as wrote rus.err.ee, the prosecutor’s office has presented Semilarsky with suspicions of bribery and violation of anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions of particularly large size.
This happened in October 2016, when he was arrested along with another deputy mayor Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
The prosecutor’s office and the security police said there was strong evidence against the two vice-mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later came to a court, which was fully justified by politics.
The trial of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.

How the ECB’s decision to lower the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It fell another 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historical minimum.
Judging by the return of a short step of the rate cut, as well as the tonality of the ECB’s statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy mitigation may soon stop.
“We have continued to soften monetary policy, primarily given that the risks of deflecting inflation still remain below 4% in 2021,” the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, said in a statement.
They are associated with a significant decrease in economic activity, a fall in domestic and foreign demand.
The recovery of the economy, Nabiullina said, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods were expanded, the annual rate of decrease in freight traffic, industrial production slowed.
According to the ECB’s revised forecast, the economy will shrink 4.5-5.5% in 2020 (previously 4-6% expected), and the recovery growth in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the Central Bank had expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia’s inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia’s view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, according to the economists on Russia and the CIS “Renaissance Capital” Sofia Donetsk and Andrey Melashenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia consistently lowers the key rate more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the ECB immediately lowered it by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to suppressed demand and the need to stimulate a slowed-down economy due to the pandemic and its associated constraints.
The chances for monetary policy adjustment are still there (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, the chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev agrees.
The set of pro-inflation risks also points to a near pause in mitigating interest policy – disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
In addition, the Bank of Russia’s subsequent actions will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvesting season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts.
Either way, the reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as possibly on a mortgage, says senior economist of the analytical management of Otkritie Bank Maxim Petronevich.
The rate adjustment will be less pronounced than the reduction in the key rate, he clarifies.

During working trips to the areas of Ust-Ordynsky Buryatsky District, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The order for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now has the situation managed to move from a dead spot.
866 million rubles will be spent on the construction.
Deadline for completion of the construction in 2022.
And already this year, a school in the village of Bayandai should be put into operation.
The finishing of the premises has now been completed.
Of the remaining works - improvement of the territory.
In general, the program of construction of pre-school and secondary facilities is of particular importance for the region.
Especially for your county.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for education and recreation of children of all ages, - said Igor Kobzev, Governor of the Irkutsk region.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all the mayors to actively participate in the work on the development of general plans of settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant objects, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage objects, - the head of the region emphasized.
Also during the conversation was raised a problematic issue with the reduction of milk intake from cooperatives by 30%.
This was due to the redistribution of milk purchases by the processing company in favour of farms.
As a result, the share of product receipts from cooperatives has decreased.
The Head of the region instructed the acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk implementation, analyze the experience of other territories and identify options for solving the problem.

The authorities of Moscow told about the fate of closed landfills
In Moscow, landfills of solid household waste continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities have promised to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being modernized into modern waste recycling complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them have grown a dense residential building.
After the polygon is closed, it rises for recultivation - the body of the polygon is overflowing with soils, the systems of degassing and infiltration are installed.
This allows to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not emit odours, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains to rise a useless heap among the surrounding residential building.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruse, where the recultivation of the Annino landfill literally ended recently, the authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope out of a pile.
This landfill, operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so much that it went beyond the boundaries of the land allocated to it.
Therefore, in the recultivation had to buy out neighboring areas, de facto long already loaded with rubbish under the binding.
“It will take some time, the field will catch up, the fortress will be built up, and we will think what can be done so that it will start to benefit.
Right in the eye - a ski resort," - the head of the Russian district Nikolai Parthenov told reporters.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo fields in Lubertz and Timokhovo in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
On the territory of "Torbeev" by the end of the year will be launched a gas pump power plant, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide its own needs of the field - heat supply administrative and production.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste recycling complex.
And on the Balashikhino field "Kuchino", which was closed after complaints of residents on the "Direct Line" with the president of the country, a museum can be created.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum for the recultivation of the suburban landfills," said Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kurakin, Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of the region.

Beautiful tall minarets just decorated Aya-Sofia
Once again about Aya-Sofia - got the text of Vladimir Zelinsky, which, please, must be protested.
First, there was a free entrance - Hurrah!
I haven’t been to Istanbul, but it’s better to have free entrance to the House of God than paid.
Second, the Muslims have conquered this land just as honestly as the Orthodox have conquered the Volgo-Ok River, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans have conquered America.
Are we going to give it back to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, in the place of which is the Decade Church?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved this building, invested in it.
That is, they, as well as the factories and estates which the Lenins have taken from the bourgeoisie into their own property, belong to the Lenins – Putin and the other nomenclature.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so they're all rightfully progressors.
Beautiful tall minarets very decorated Aya-Sofia, very.
It was a stupid ink, it became a stupid ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no “Islamic” and “Orthodox” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hangers that unite faith and hypocrisy.
The believer does not think in the categories of civilization.
This is the thinking of the British Foreign Office official Toynbee, a believer ashamed to think so.
Every believer has a place of prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave – he goes away to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're cobblestones, not ugrium-stones.

The actor of the Russian series responded to the accusations of "LGBT propaganda and feminism"
The actor of the Russian TV series Chiki, whose creators were accused of “LGBT propaganda and feminism,” responded to the film’s claims.
The authors “understood the sharpness of the raised themes and did not want to offend anyone,” said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication “The Rise.”
“It seems to me that this is a story about the power and common aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,” said the actor, who played the father of the boy who was changing into women’s clothing.
He said he was “proud of the job” and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is afraid of the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in deep intoxication shot a set and said that all this was not true".
Then there were a couple of cases when we met disgruntled locals who didn’t understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who first came with complaints began to help us,” he summed up.
The shooting took place in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunken man attacked a car of the filming group with a gun, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor to the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian series "Chiki".
She accused the creators of the series of "propaganda of unconventional sexual relations and feminism", noting that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence".
The ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "the series pays a lot of attention to homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chicks" tells about three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a friend.
