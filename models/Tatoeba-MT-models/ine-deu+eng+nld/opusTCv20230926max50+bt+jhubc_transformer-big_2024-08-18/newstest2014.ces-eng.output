The black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are struggling to find the money to repair a crumbling highway network, many are starting to see a solution in a small black box that fits easily into your car’s dashboard.
The devices that track every mile the driver drives and transmit this information to the authorities are at the core of Washington’s and state planning authorities’ controversial effort to revamp the outdated system of funding America’s major highways.
Usually, the tedious design of the highways at once stimulated intense debate and the formation of various associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to use these small boxes to record mileage and possibly where you’re going — and then use that information to compile the tax bill.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy concerns.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.
They see how they can move over the next decade to a system where the driver pays for the kilometre of the road he’s driving.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“It’s not a matter of when we can choose too much,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to begin tracking mileage for every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This is what this technology is for.
The stimulus is the fact that the Road Trust Fund funded by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations is at the bottom.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars will travel many more kilometers per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by a single cent.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test the payment system for the kilometre traveled.
“In the long run, it seems like the most logical alternative,” he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometers traveled.
It’s no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, because taxes can be used to change drivers’ behavior patterns, which can, for example, help reduce traffic jams and create greenhouse gases.
California designers are looking into this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set by ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market leaders from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to the idea that drivers will pay for the kilometres they have traveled.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to move towards paying per kilometre.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would include about 10,000 cars.
However, the leadership of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing sections of the population, whose daily life often means insulting many kilometers for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are still moving forward on their own.
The most fervent is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon start paying the state a mileage tax instead of a gas tax.
Nevada has completed the pilot project.
New York is currently investigating the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent on trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transport ministries, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not have only advocates.
In Nevada, where the facility was recently equipped with about 50 volunteer cars, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor their every move.
“Concerns about Big Brother surveillance and similar issues have been a major issue,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build an enormously cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to record the daily outings and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find affordable technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometers a car will find, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The pursuit of such technology has led some state agencies to a small California company called True Mileage (the actual distance traveled).
This company was not originally involved in the action to assist the government in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging market with legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they’d leave.
But this device, which it is testing, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only supplies a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to go if you don’t track their speed and location,” says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been a number of major errors in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or they may not take any facilities and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of kilometers taken by all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will accede to this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay parking hours, provide mileage insurance, and collect data on the speed of other drivers so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them,” the city’s projection document states.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussions about paying per kilometre are not just a huge substitution problem.
Officials from the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Committee say Congress could easily solve the problem with the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the tax on gasoline.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when it is enough to take aspirin richly," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot more.
Sobotka is negotiating for <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
Social democracies are swarming, the people and the grandparents are talking together and are preparing to move forward together.
If the Social Democrats get agitated within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly executed partners, who will put on the table a complete list of demands, including ministerial posts.
The ambassadors of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will either swallow the acidic coalition grapes, or they will nod at the swirling minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka came across for the first time after four days of a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political gremium and, above all, to force convicted liars to resign.
Only he is the confirmed negotiator, the other team members will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEO).
I apologized to the members of the greece and now to the citizens.
You should not lie in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said after the meeting of the closest leadership of social democracy.
He added that he did not suffer for the position of First Vice-President.
"I will announce my decision on November 10 at <0xC3><0x9A>VV," Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>kromach, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD vice-president, and Jeron<0xC3><0xBD>m Tejc, the head of the parliamentary club, spoke similarly.
He said he was elected just two days ago.
Both MEPs then declared that they would do everything to make the 50-member <0xC4><0x8C>SSD club sound like one voice.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek put the crown on the absurd theatre with the sentence: "I have been a member of the Czechoslovak SSR for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party authorities."
Or another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget when he called for Sobotka’s resignation and his dismissal from the negotiating team that the <0xC3><0x9A>VV decided 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party’s candidate for prime minister?
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, however, by summoning the <0xC3><0x9A>VV only next Sunday, made a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with various rumors and rumors, possibly reminding the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
Dirty laundry will be washed vigorously, there will be signs of dark alliances between the uglobarone Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala and the Sobotka wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> will be discussed.
Disputes erupt in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The words of Ostrava’s mayor and Sobotkov’s ally Petr Kajnar are striking: “I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots.”
If <0xC3><0x9A>VV were to meet this weekend, liars would probably be forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
The traitors will sprinkle their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning head of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will then end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on OH problems in Sochi: Communication with Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he exhales deeply: "It's challenging."
According to Martin Doktor, cooperation with the organizing team of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi is a bit more complicated.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
“Nothing works the same way,” says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not so exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information on essential things, not so much.
For example, we have been asking for three months to tell us how each village will be officially marked, so that we can do a number of things accordingly.
We're still waiting and they're still saying they're communicating the thing.
They still communicate in a lot of things.
Has the Olympic Village been built yet?
But it's not a catastrophic situation anymore.
A month ago, we walked through empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean that they are empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just basic concrete, so that was the condition a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that until we arrive there on January 26th as an advance, there will still be a smell of glue.
And if they don't, what's going to happen?
Do you think President Putin will push the army there?
That's exactly how it's going to work.
Just so it's not that Olympic villages <0x3D> Potemkin's villages.
Rather, they threaten to fail, for example, to modify the paths, not to complete the details.
Maybe they'll have paths in such a state that we'll have to take the London Games boots with us.
But I think they're going to screw it up somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, this number changes.
Maybe the skaters will ride in the trio they've ridden.
No one has to doubt the speed skater Martina S<0xC3><0xA1>bl<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1> either, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should be flying there until January 26.
What the Olympic Village will look like, we know.
We even measured some things ourselves by the subway, so as not to believe only the sketches.
We also prepare a number of other things, including transportation.
And what does the head of mission do 100 days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am making a regular agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin promised an ecological Olympics, the plan hates him huge secret landfills
Fans of winter sports are already cutting the meter before the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are looking at their preparation with increasing concern.
The Russian Olympics, although it will only start in February, is facing another scandal.
Russians do not seem to be able to fulfill the promise that the preparation and the performance of the games will not harm the nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will go in four months.
In fact, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high bar built, and the Canadian Games were considered to be the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize games with "zero waste", he has long taken for his own.
Reporters of the AP agency last week discovered a huge landfill of building material in the village of Achstyr near Sochi.
So, a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulation foam was found already in August by environmentalists, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have sloughed and the landfill has disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters got a glimpse of a landfill the size of three football pitches.
It is not the only one, in the area of such places several have been created, the British newspaper The Times described.
The Russian Railways operates on the site, a state monopoly that builds a 60-kilometre route between Sochi Airport and the sports resort.
The company, which has already squandered 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin’s close associates Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways defended that the landfill was founded by one of the subcontractors.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of the village, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village for three months, day and night.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local river Mzymtu, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water from here will contaminate Sochi's water sources for the next ten to fifteen years," Vladimir Kimayev, an environmental non-profit, told British newspaper EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizing committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
For comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing cost $43 billion.
Last year’s games in London cost only $19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver $9 billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays, and fears that there will eventually be enough snow, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working on the exhibition of sports venues and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers stabbed his mouth to protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are grappling with a new law banning the promotion of homosexuality during the games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
A young couple ripened to live with their parents, a new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates has been tasked with designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, while the land itself is somewhat sloping.
The requirement further stated that two generations would live in the house, who would like to live together, but at the same time each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
The architects therefore decided to place each house in one of the floors of the house.
"When creating the design, we respected the family connections, history and memories associated with the place."
“The three different functions of the house are connected by several paths through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their own privacy,” the designers explain.
The home of the parents is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in the final finish of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was formed using slab panels, the part where the office is plastered white and the remaining elements remained in a clean concrete finish without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very connected to the exterior.
The home of the parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance for the family.
The interconnection of the interior with the exterior underlines the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues all the way to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climbs up the stairs to their premises.
It is the stairs that are the main dominating interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to cascade through them.
It was in this way that the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and impress something unique on it.
The home of the young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
It is only separated from the terrace by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living area with dining area and kitchen in the house of the young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space that freely transitions to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black color.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall and then climbs up the stairs.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to Zeman and ODS.
Over the past few months, I have repeatedly called on students, educators and the leadership of secondary and higher schools in several regions to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign conducted by President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman in schools.
I have met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the Honorary Chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, was even punished for this in the form of an invitation not to celebrate the state holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools that were not so brave and made it possible for Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman to visit: Higher Technical Education in Brno, Gymnasium Hladnov in Ostrava, Higher School of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n, J.E. Purkyn University in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem.
Now in Pardubice, we are meeting with the continuation of the promotion of politics in universities.
Simeon Karamazov, a newly elected member of the ODS, dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, refuses to step down from his academic position and it seems normal to him.
Mr. Professor, this is not really the same as staying, for example, as mayor of a smaller town.
Do you want to be one of the Czechoslovak SSR leaders who simultaneously forge the function of MP and SSR and, like them, degrade both professions?
By telling people that you can handle both of these challenging functions of the left back.
I know, we have an example of Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, who manages even a few dozen functions at once.
But that’s not exactly an example of a person you should be following.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Frankov<0xC3><0xA1>, who rather left the parliamentary post so that she could devote herself fully to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the office of Dean is that you violate the apoliticality of the academic soil of Pardubice University during the course of your duties.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current work in both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help "your" school even without remaining a dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion as I have and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider retiring and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may be counted by the voters in the next election.
And it doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice bubble cabbage, chemistry does not add to it
More than a thousand tons of sourdough cabbage will be produced in the coming months in Slovakia’s Frut<0xC3><0xA1> Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season started here in October and will last about half a year.
Healthy delights have been produced here since 1925 in the traditional way, that is, by stepping directly in large tanks.
In modern industrial times it is a rarity.
Our employees will embark on an almost ten-kilometre route in exchange.
Each of the ten tanks can accommodate fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts, "slov<0xC3><0xA1>ck<0xC3><0xA1> Fruta director David Kladroba said.
Heads of cabbage are transported to the company’s premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostro<0xC5><0xBE>sk and B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk.
The Fruit staff then cleans the vegetables, removes the bones and throws them into the bowl.
From here, the already cut cabbage falls into pools six meters deep, in which the pawns dressed in white clothes and socks work tirelessly.
This removes unwanted air from the air.
The last layer of cabbage is covered with a sheet and loaded with water.
"The green currant then ripens for six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation-promoting substances," Kladroba said.
The natural process corresponds to production in domestic conditions, individual layers are sprinkled with salt and cumin.
After fermentation, the cabbage travels to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweet-acid infusion into bags or glasses and subjected to sterilisation.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut primarily to the domestic and Slovak markets.
Interest is also registered in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to 'cooperate' with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence sniper, said he was willing to leave for Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Strebele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and negotiated with him about the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP delivered to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: “Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as a runaway and tries to criminalize political speech with heavy charges that do not give room for defense.”
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States government to withdraw the charges of crimes against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.”
Tensions between the U.S. and Germany began to escalate when allegations surfaced that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees the report, said that if there was any opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the United States,” it should be done.
Mr. Strebele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo of him and Mr. Snowden on his Twitter post.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left one day.
If Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, a member of parliament said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign associated with persecution that forced him to leave home.
However, he said that the reaction of the whole world to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens across the board and senior officials – including those in the United States – have assessed the discovery of an unwarranted system of ubiquitous public service surveillance.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities “until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.”
We are sorry for the killing, but we are innocent, the representatives of the Khmer Rouge defend themselves
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge government, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population of the country, died as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution.
The infamous commander of the S-21 prison was awarded a life sentence by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charged with genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, slavery and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interest of the nation and had no idea what the real extent of the killing was.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," he told the court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no power,” he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered the Khmer Rouge to “treat people badly or kill them, deny them food or commit genocide.”
But he acknowledged "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Chea's apology.
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"She won't care about the other one," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordinates wouldn't have been killed," she added, adding that the Khmer Rouge leaders were "worse than monsters."
The "foreign minister" of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ieng Sara, was also expected to stand trial, but he died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found by the court in September 2012 to be incapable of trial for dementia.
The Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is going to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for hand luggage on board during its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though in their announcement on Wednesday, they said passengers will be able to keep a full can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so small luggage under the seat will remain free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if passengers with payment will wait until arrival at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 fee is meant to encourage passengers to make sure they pay in advance.
"We would not like to collect this fee," she said.
Airlines began to charge for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and threw in the hand luggage stored in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in that space.
Fees are one of the ways passengers learn to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said the purpose of this new fee isn't really to make more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the top storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier gate can bring luggage for which they will pay nothing, while the other passenger in the queue will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said the website and check-in procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s new hand luggage fee will not be in effect until the summer, but a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of the luggage costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see an additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them did not pay for their hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost airline Allegiant Air followed suit later.
The only company that also has such charges is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says aviation advisor Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring the additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage fee would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and was amazed at what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit baggage charge.
“Getting on a plane was the smoothest thing I’ve ever seen in my aviation career,” he said.
I was expecting to see a crackling of teeth and quarrels at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the boarding took place in an instant."
Frontier will also charge fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice based on the Spirit model.
Frontier said that passengers who get lemonade or juice can keep a whole can and coffee will be replenished for free.
Water will continue to be served free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to introduce beverage charges in 2008, but after complaints from passengers seven months later, it withdrew, and no other major airline imitated it.
Frontier’s last move to charge for hand luggage, if passengers do not purchase a flight directly from this airline, is its last attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines incentives to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, instead of doing so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, it began giving customers who purchased through an online travel agency only half a mile as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for flying miles to 25 percent of the mileage.
So the 1,000-mile trip with Frontier purchased through an online travel agency means a 250-mile reward.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and losing money.
According to financial results released on Wednesday by Republic Airways Holdings, revenues fell by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter
Republic, with the sale of this airline, is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
The NSA doesn’t blame hackers for the crash, it blames “internal error”
The secretive National Security Agency said last Friday that its website had crashed for several hours last week due to an internal error, not an attack by hackers, some claimed on the internet.
"The NSA.gov website was not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update," the spy agency said in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be resolved later this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors noted that the NSA’s website was not functioning for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were not “at all” endangered.
The spokesman said no classified information was at risk.
At least one group of hacker activists on the internet claimed to be responsible for deleting NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target web pages with information until the servers are overloaded and the page crashes.
This cyber tactics is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, formerly known as Edward No such agency, has in recent months become the center of public attention after a string of foreign and domestic surveillance programs were unveiled and the target of biting criticism, collectively the product of the NSA's alienation of secret files.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has prompted earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier’s profit declined as a result of a decline in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier on Thursday reported a 15 percent decline in net profit, which is caused by fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether the aircraft will comply with an ambitious plan to launch commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is progressing well.
The results did not meet the estimates and shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange fell by 8 percent.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen on Thursday lowered the rating from “higher yield” to “sector performance” with expectations that the stock market will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While we mostly expected smaller aircraft deliveries, the profit margins in the transport sector have disappointed us significantly,” Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the test program continues, we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market skepticism towards this program to increase.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries fights into the lower market area, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was discovered in March, and after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company's claims regarding the low consumption and cost savings of this transport aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
The executives also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program is proceeding as planned.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground testing and software updates were planned during the aircraft's downtime.
Every manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks and the others not long after.
Analysts are still skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier says it has assessed its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – despite being in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be moved to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
Of the $172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share in the third quarter ending September 30.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover declined marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters’ IBES system, analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered only 45 aircraft during the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion by September 30, which does not change even by December 31.
“The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but the low order intake and overall market situation disappointed us,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said revenue in this division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts amounted to 32.6 billion as of September 30, a marginal increase from December 31.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The executives said that new perspectives will be provided in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 during the trading on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, announced a 10 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the mobster about a police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, was to pass information on to the King of the Underworld Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come to light.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top lawyer who briefed a drug mobster about a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come to light was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, had after he became suspected of cocaine use, the underworld boss Neil Scarbrough passed on sensitive information about investigations into his drug-smuggling activities.
The lawyer, nicknamed “Bash” (the party) and criminally acclaimed as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 following police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he had represented in previous drug cases.
Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at a law firm in Blackburn, Lancashire, for dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet, and his credit cards, the investigation found that Ditta was a regular class A drug user.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he attempted to obtain information on the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were under surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police seized about <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine along with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids, another 32 people ended up in prison along with them.
Ditta, 42, was passing on information to criminals for fear of his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works for Blackburn-based Forbes Solicitors, experienced a shameful moment before the Liverpool Crown Court when, after a three-week trial, he was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases.
At a previous hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer’s fall came after Scarborough’s police investigation revealed that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him putting 60 percent pure drugs under his lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Afterwards, Scarborough and Ditta, who were having dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, were in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two.
The court heard that traces of class A drugs were found in his hair, wallet, and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, saying he had spoken to the suspect dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation falls within “confidential communication.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but all of them were detained and his hair samples were taken.
During a police interrogation, he said that he was running the office both at his home address and at work, and that clients visited him at home for work.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives know about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware of not violating the law than a criminal attorney?”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer and of having come into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about is not just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the limits of a normal lawyer-client relationship.
Police investigations were thwarted as much as they could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession, on the contrary, he dishonored it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be violated.
Ditta said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not and would like to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have expected 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire police inspector Lee Halstead said, “Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself from a criminal attorney when he started getting drugs from organized criminals.”
His dependence on cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading figures in organized crime groups who tasked him with gathering valuable information about a police investigation.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of impeccability, and they must inspire public confidence and the feeling that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Unit for Serious and Organized Crime in Lancashire conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, under which he was also convicted of three cases of possession of cocaine and now of obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We'll find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in trafficking were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, in which he said his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death cell block in America, as a guest at dinner would wish Mohammed Ali, and as a motivation for the job he cited inequality.
He negotiated a government with Klaus and <0xC5><0xA0>pidla.
Now the people sent Jan Kasal against Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
In the elections, the people won fourteen MPs, that is, only a third of the number of Social Democrats or YES representatives.
However, they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to discuss the outlines of possible coalitions, there is Jan Kasala - a man who, as a people's man, arranged the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> have such a matador on their side.
This will probably remind us of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
“Experience was minimal at the time,” Kasal estimates, as this year’s talks will unfold.
Kenyan Press Reveals Controversial Media Law
“This is a frightening report and it is time to ask what will prevent parliament from simply erasing the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” the newspapers said in a statement.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of the most recognized independent radio stations and news sites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be preoccupied because it is an extended hand of government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will hear us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to MPs," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill effectively hands over “full control of the media” to the government, and Standard newspapers state that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya “have sustained a hard blow,” and criticize the bill as “rigorous.”
The approval of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping mall.
The anger of the authorities turned on the Kenyan media when it broadcast a security camera footage on which soldiers sent to the site of the attack allegedly robbed the luxury goods trade.
The police director reacted by having two journalists and a leading media worker summoned for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn following media pressure.
According to the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million along with the risk of “dismissal” or may be denied official journalist accreditation.
The court also has the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “one fine is enough to dispose of most of the radio stations.”
It also states that these measures may have a liquidating impact on what is called the Kenyan “living blogosphere”.
Politicians know that when they silence the media, they can do with impunity what they want.
“You never know what can happen,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back for hunting and collecting,” he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the cuts ordered by the National Wage Agency and to restore their fat salaries to around 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, which thus ranks among the highest in the world.
You have to save, young Czechs know.
But most of them don’t know what the interest rate is.
More and more Czechs are putting their money aside.
However, they do not reach the champions in savings in the region.
The most money is put aside by Austrians, who save an average of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>181 a month.
A little more than Czechs will save even people in Slovakia.
This is the result of a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer Group in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the scouts is improving and two-thirds of the respondents plan to put more money aside.
While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranks of breeders, in Romania and Serbia people who save products still use very little.
For example, according to the survey, almost every second Serb saves "under the pillow" at home.
This year, the number of people who save more money per month has increased.
Last year, between CZK 26,000 and CZK 26% of respondents spent on various types of savings every month, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly deposit in the year-over-year comparison fell slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit among savings products is pension supplementation.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, compared to last year, the interest in investment funds also fell significantly.
Only 16 percent of respondents use them, compared to almost a quarter last year.
The survey also found that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what yields they achieve on individual products.
Especially young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is interest-bearing.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents has the best knowledge of the profitability of their stored money, 73 percent of people over the age of fifty know this.
In an international comparison, Erste Czechi Group leads in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12 percent gap.
United Nations Celebrates New Goals to Fight Poverty
The United Nations is now working on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Prior to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in enforcing “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Mr. Ki-mun said overnight at the summit that now is the time to “raise above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the overall Sustainable Development Goals – SDGs,” he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique escalate due to conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputa to provoke peaceful slogans for a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
For fear of the future of her country, she exchanged business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand safety" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, reports came almost daily of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party, one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious insurgent movement, originally backed by the White government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that an open conflict will re-emerge in the country, but recent events have scared foreign investors and locals.
The fast-growing economy is at stake as discoveries of vast offshore oil and coal reserves in the northwest can bring in more than $50 billion worth of investment from companies such as Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, Italian Eni and American Anadarko over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the resulting tension.
The Renamo party claims that the government provoked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, the traditional Renamo party's garden, on September 17.
Violent attacks by former rebels culminated as government forces attacked Renamo’s base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlaka, the group’s leader, Renamo’s spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government accuses Renamo of initiating conflicts because they allegedly attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to alleviate his fears of instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a “disaster” who wanted to use “anything left of his power to try to prove that he can order his own decisions to the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But concerns grew when Mr. Mazanga’s words were quoted that the Renamo party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant that Frelimo was no longer respecting the agreement.
“Our goal is to get back to the negotiations, but with seriousness,” said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to alleviate tensions between these parties, fueled by a series of clashes this year.
It’s a charade between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has sought electoral changes, has already said it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt by the dying movement to gain benefits and financial gains from the government.
The Renamo party's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its electoral position.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza – who ends his second term next year – wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democratic system, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to let go of the presidential office,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but it has carried out disruptive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between the north and south.
Most of the clashes occurred in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers away from the capital Maputo, but where the city of Beira, a port relied on by mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, during their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga did not wish to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development, and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president, and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he said.
Demonstrator Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” says the author.
Tales of Thor may show that “rough strength cannot be equal to clever cunning,” while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of dreaming.
A large part of the myths would be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach at school,” said Crossley-Holland, who pleads for a careful selection of works appropriate to the age.
“I think it’s great that myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I defended this plan for 20 years.
He added that "openly instructive" authors and teachers are at the intriguing story with a "underground" message for children as a "switch".
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from English and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Fairy Tales, says: “You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end up happy, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through story, not openly determined.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors into space in a new digital camera
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can immerse themselves in new comfortable seats and over their heads has been added a projection area of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
In order to make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are placed around the room.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It's twenty-one computers that generate an image," said the director of the Brno observatory, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a holistic impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of classic personal computers," said technician Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Hlad<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Digit<0xC3><0xA1>rium is able to enchant an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The spectators find themselves directly in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Other similar facilities are closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to screen the purchased shows and their own creation in the hall.
There have been two shows on the program since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
In it, people will learn about the training of astronauts, fly into space, turn to centrifuges, and then see on illustrative examples how astronauts face challenging conditions in space.
The second show is for children and is called Magic Rock - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the moment when a nearby volcano exploded.
The entire digitarium cost about fifty million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the constellation also contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projected area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed by audiovisual technology and computers," Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
The installation of the digital camera was followed by the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to the director of Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, between 25,000 and 30,000 visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We've studied 11,000 advertisements!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured more than 11,000 job ads, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 ads (62%) on the Internet.
The Internet is becoming the most important medium for the publication of job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010), it has stabilized at about 60 percent.
According to the analysis, the advertising of job opportunities in itself largely reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published in the period of economic prosperity and in the time of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same period, compared to less than half in 2012.
The job offer on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, in particular a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of workers, said the author of the analysis Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0xA0><0xC5><0xA1>astnov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different for both media.
On the Internet, the top spots were advertisers looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses appeared only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, a large representation belongs mainly to the service and labor professions.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently cited requirements that employers express through an advertising offer.
Other areas of study included the knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement to know a foreign language was mentioned in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In only two percent of the ads, employers demanded an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for ‘computer literacy’ appeared in 40 percent of ads (in daily print at 11 percent, on the Internet at 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Requirements for practice are all associated with qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other managers.
The workers’ professions are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, the author of the study Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Tillner added.
Employers shall also indicate the characteristics and skills requirements of potential candidates in the middle of their advertisements.
As the most frequently requested skills, communication skills have appeared in advertising in the first place for a long time.
Employers also demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organizational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is the birthplace of a solo comedy performance in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the president of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes to the assembled people by means of an interview.
Fay’s innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the institution of solo comedy Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these titles have appeared at Carolines and have become successful to the point that they are too big to play at the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes,” an annual musical comedy charity performance at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, and Roger Waters, among others.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came from unconventional channels, such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll excelled with his sitcom (happy spicy "League" on a fantasy-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", but was most famous for the rapidly spreading video series "Marcel the shell with shoes on".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, driven, racially focused W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest draws of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedic historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely in the comedic DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, he sometimes walked down the alley between two buildings and said, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
The price of oil fell to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high supplies were balanced by a report that showed the strengthening of China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil index for December deliveries during the late morning fell in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents and lagged by 5.8 percent for the month of October.
Rich oil supplies have weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, two reports of Chinese production spurred increased demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth that rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
Brent oil, an indicator for international oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the London International Trade Exchange.
Well, no, Mr. Haask.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
It is necessary to exert such pressure that Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is stripped of all political functions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so dwindling.
Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek shields himself with the promise he made, but each and every politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of the given promise and very much consider what can be promised.
Confidence is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babi<0xC5><0xA1> also has the material one, but it is a question of whether he is a politician).
The self-deprecating program promoted by a liar is unreliable.
He does not apologize in politics, he resigns in politics.
Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>k, if you mean it well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in this, if you are not lying - here you see how it is with lying complex), you will leave politics alone, as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of the man who made the mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a backless weakling whose words or actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be proud, even a mistaken person, or a lifelong skeptic.
It may seem unfair to you when I speak only to you, but you are the leader and they are the wrong sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to fold your ears for a moment, regroup your forces, put down the shame, and then attack again, but that's how partisans or subversives act.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes a leader, an alpha male, so act like this.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The court blocked the regulation on the procedure for the arrest and search of persons by the police department in NY
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order requiring changes to the program of arrest and search of persons at the New York police department and dismissed a judge from the case.
A second U.S. federal appeals court said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the city's appeal decision.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and interrogating people.
The city’s conclusions and its remedial regulations were challenged, including the decision to assign oversight to help the police department change its practices and its associated training program.
The appeals court heard the arguments for the postponement sought on Tuesday.
The appeals court said the judge must be dismissed from the case because she had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by failing to act as a judge to avoid the appearance of indulgence, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements she openly responded to.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongfully targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their arrest and search program.
It established independent oversight to oversee major changes, including reform of procedures, training and oversight, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test body-worn cameras in some areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The oral justification for the city’s appeal is scheduled sometime after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of arrest and search of persons have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
There has been a form of arrest and search for people for some decades, but recorded searches under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg dramatically increased to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases involving blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, wrote a lawsuit that became a case of a group lawsuit.
Proponents of the NYPD’s stop and search program say the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how these practices are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that they will waste money, but will not solve the wider problem when the police force is under pressure after its numbers have decreased by several thousand people in the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of arresting and searching people, which is constitutional, but reformed the way the NYPD conducted searches.
One-fifth of shopping malls suffer from low traffic
This is according to data from real estate consulting companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Shopping Centre opens to the public in Prague’s Bohnice and will be the 19th shopping centre in Prague.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are the inadequately large center to the locality and the poor layout, i.e. too many floors or the complicated and opaque layout of the passages, or the dead spots of the centers," said Michal Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Jones Lang LaSalle’s retail real estate manager, Sylvie Samadi, about one-fifth of the malls are experiencing low traffic.
The main reasons include poor accessibility, low-income category of local residents or oversaturation of the market in a given place.
Some projects were almost fully occupied, but their results were mostly unsatisfactory at first.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping malls need to make more efforts to "entice" their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
The occupancy of shopping centers is generally stable, according to Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k, even for some centers it is rising, because the landlords were willing in the crisis to discount the rent and rent some units.
"But it is true that some projects have recently been opened that are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (for example Breda & Weinstein in Opava, <0xC5><0xA0>antovka in Olomouc), "said Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k.
According to Sylvia Samadi, the shopping malls opened in the last two years are spreading on the market very slowly.
But there is a place in the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for building a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centers', aimed at shopping and services of daily necessities for the population living in the immediate vicinity," said Samadi.
Also, according to Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k, there is a place on the domestic market for other shopping centers.
This is for small 'service' centers as well as for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or extensions in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth," Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k added.
In Prague, he sees the space for the prepared business center on Victory Square, furthermore, he believes that they have a clear potential of Na P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>kopa Street and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is developing intensively, which allows traders to cover and expand to smaller cities at favorable rental and operating costs, and there is also space in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, respectively for their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of a commercial building."
There are currently 90 modern shopping centers in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross rental area.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In terms of the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values of Britain and France, the Czech Republic is about 50 square meters behind per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check his tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson reportedly used the “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” methods to confirm a fraudulent tip on a love affair that was supposed to involve then-internal minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis at Old Bailey said News of the World had caught fake news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Pawlby.
The papers instructed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to break into Pawlby's voicemail and penetrate her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson had also called her and left her voice messages.
“The U.S. Attorney suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the man standing in front of the house hoping to catch people outside, but the man who likes to push people’s stories to see what they say,” Edis said.
He said NotW newspapers used three ways to investigate stories: hacking into a phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently he knows about the other, the surveillance, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about breaking into the phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
The rumors about the love affair that Clarke is involved in were first captured by the NotW news reporting department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A recording of voicemail messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private investigator’s computer where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as “Projects.”
“During the time Mrs. Pawlby was being investigated, her grandparents were receiving anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby,” Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former Reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Mrs Pawlby's movement.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, telling her, "I've got a story that we're going to publish tomorrow and I'd love to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis says Coulson's involvement in the story was modeled on the same model as that of other prominent figures, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
In court on Thursday, it was reported that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with his married wife, while he himself was seeing the co-accused Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied collusion with other people for the purpose of hacking into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to breaking into the phone.
NSA Revealing Increases Social Paranoia of State Monitoring
One peaceful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter hovered over the U.S. consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the behest of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take photos of the roof of the U.S. forward patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media claim that the BfV office hoped to be able to identify the presence of interceptor antennas, and this action triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the United States is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal trade secrets from foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies in order to strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But ever since Edward Snowden, who became an informant, began to uncover his valuable collection of covert surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading businessmen, they no longer know if they should believe the director’s words.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying on Brazilian oil companies and gaining access to data held by U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, it has reached widespread paranoia about state surveillance of new dimensions.
The last drop came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone was perhaps intercepted for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be the target, then surely leading entrepreneurs are also the potential target.
Snowden has made clear the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey released in July by the EY consultancy, German companies are convinced that in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as much risk as China.
But so far, there is no evidence in all the documentation Mr. Snowden has uncovered that the United States has been transferring trade secrets from foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concerns that the EU lacks some IT and Internet capabilities, and said it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical of this.
There are voices from the German parliament that we should make a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and slowly open them again.
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn’t have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Anything but the IT industry.
The scope and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking for some companies who have previously believed that China is the biggest threat from surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European leaders have been more aware that data stored in the U.S. falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. and is therefore potentially attackable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the US Prism data mining program was unveiled.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says, “We have this new question for customers who weren’t here a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will stay in this jurisdiction physically?”
Many high-ranking German officials argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is not surprising.
It's always happened.
“This has been an important topic for many years and has not changed significantly during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF Agrochemicals.
Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
In general, business leaders do not want to brag too much about the countermeasures they have taken to prevent the attacker from gaining an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB memory stick at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi board of directors, says it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting, so that they cannot be used as a listening device.
The German BfV advises executives to consider not using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the risk that smartphones can be misidentified.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be discarded.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many of these companies are leading the global market in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” warns the BfV in its report.
The U.S. warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, U.S. documents by the National Intelligence Estimate in February cited France alongside Russia and Israel in the second row of perpetrators who engage in hacking activities for economic reporters, right behind China.
A member of the board of the German risk-free society concluded that in terms of economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said this month in one of the interviews: “The services know quite well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a teenage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a teenage boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a wrestling ghost in his high school gym believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found dead on January 11th in a reclining hallway behind the stands in the gymnasium high school he attended.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County County concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of the 17-year-old refuses.
“They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
“They are convinced that this is contrary to logic, to physical laws, and also to common sense,” Crump said.
They believe that it is necessary to hide what really happened in order to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back to them in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep an eye on the facts, wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a normal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy suggested Johnson had died as a result of “position strangulation.”
However, according to Moore, the second autopsy revealed a different cause of death.
“There are a few questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if he discovers enough evidence in the case of Johnson’s death to warrant an investigation into a crime or a violation of civil rights, he will ask the FBI and its enforcement.
The deputy sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to make available all the videos from the surveillance cameras that investigators viewed.
The teen’s parents hope the video will contain a clue to how their son died.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools on allergy in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the U.S. government because the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines include information for schools on how to educate the teaching staff and staff about children's food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline at their disposal – most often an EpiPen auto-injector – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that appear in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
A child can say, “It’s like someone’s kicking my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “My tongue itches.”
Parents of intersex children may choose ‘unspecified sex’
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize the third sex in children born with an ambiguous sex system.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to list any gender for such children, and allows them to list gender as “unspecified” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The goal of the law is to stop pushing parents to have their child rushed to opt for a sex-determining operation, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'll remain a doctor-made salad, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that out of 2000 children, one is born each year, which is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall within the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed genitals.
The intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Determination of sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is not possible to determine the sex, it is better to use the best available information and determine it, instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until the time of the operation, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not," he said.
Determination of gender can be performed without surgery and then can wait for how the identity develops.
Knowing how a child develops sexuality is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex individuals as different from transgender or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These traits can be manifested in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, busts and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sex organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys of no gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to identify in official documents male, female or “third sex”.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world’s first recognized “non-sexual” person in June when she won an appeal to remain “unspecified” for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will have a third designation, X, in addition to M (male) and F (female), for intersex persons.
In neighbouring France, according to a report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove “sex theory” from school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also defined German law and wrote: “As the world is drawn to a new state where sex is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we are turning two other pillars of civilization upside down.”
A mother of a newborn from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see that the babies are assigned sex at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children of both male and female sexes have been called hermaphrodites, according to the handsome, double-sexed River.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a board that could be erased and re-drawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation with the fact that sexuality is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision because they do not know how children will feel when they grow up due to their gender.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The persistent theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who was of the opinion that sex is submissive.
He created a new concept of “gender” and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment – how parents raised their child – influenced the child’s genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theory became controversial.
To the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to poorly performed circumcision, he recommended that their child be completely castrated, his testicles removed, and raised as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he was re-operated on the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared “dissatisfied with the result”.
It was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous sex system.
Doctors were unsure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfactory life.”
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from the external organs and testicles and was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18 he was sent on a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was frightening.
After birth, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sex development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his sex system.
After he found out the truth, he turned back into a man, took doses of testosterone, and had his breasts removed,
Operations caused his infertility.
Today, she represents others in the organization called the Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based legal group Advocates for informed choice, fears that the German law “calls for censorship and stigma.”
"Many activists are concerned that German law will achieve the goal of encouraging parents to make quick decisions and choose 'uncertain' ones for the child," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will ultimately sound, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex."
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid sex,” she said.
German law is going to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not lead at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh chest radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would “give powers” to both parents and children.
Baratza's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie's female traits have developed.
She has a vagina, but she has no uterus and ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and working as an intern in child psychiatry as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law gives parents some room to make their decisions without any haste," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and change their minds, and it gives them time to write “man” or “woman.”
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise your child and you love him.
You have a wonderful child and you are happy about it.
You don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and takes away the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child decides which gender he identifies more with – and that’s a great thing.
This gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk poured gasoline over the house: he threatened to burn it down with his own family!
Tension was rising, fear was escalating.
The man began to threaten to set the whole house on fire.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as the fire brigade unit from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav and the volunteer fire brigade unit, went to the site.
A police negotiator arrived at the scene, trying to excuse the man’s irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
So an intervention unit had to enter the house, which disarmed the man and tied him up.
The aggressor then ended up being examined in the Mlad<0xC3><0xB3>boleslav hospital, from where he was transferred to a counter-alcohol detention station.
The firefighters eventually filled the gas-filled house with sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition to people, all pets were also rescued from the house.
The police negotiator was not given a man, so the command went after him.
Report: Obama's Campaign Considered Replacing Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest adviser, according to the New York Times, secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden’s 2012 candidate with Hillary Clinton.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of Mark Halperin’s and John Heilmann’s eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and announced on Thursday night that the president’s top associates were holding intense group meetings and polls in late 2011 to estimate whether removing Biden would help revive Obama’s fading hopes for re-election.
According to the national-political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign and in the White House, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact of the vice president’s post on the election.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House chief advisers David Axelrod and David Plouff – knew that the change was being considered.
The book "Double Down" claims that Daley was a representative of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the nominee would "not substantially increase Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I've been through a lot of things, and this was one of them," he told Daley.
You mustn't forget that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we were like, "Christian, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley described the research as “due care,” Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had spent considerable investment to see if this move in the election was worth it.
“There is no money spent on elections and qualitative research in campaigns unless something is really seriously considered,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential card mixing.
While Daley said he did not think the president was “aware” of potential changes, the former head of the office admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn’t know about the investigation into Biden’s removal from office.
"Perhaps," Martin said.
A fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British businessman made the first ice cream that glows in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous amusement.
He came up with the idea after reading an expert treatise on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce the protein that causes lightening.
This ice cream reacts with the tongue of the consumer – it increases the pH level of the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream glows when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, so the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick me I’m delicious”, says: “It’s an amazing substance, but when it comes to manufacturing, we’re at the beginning, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you get about 2g of this substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice cream begins to shine.
We’ve tested it over the past few months and it seems to be a great idea for celebrating Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
And so each scoop costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes great.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef, and gold leaf.
However, its next product is expected to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream."
Essentially, it's impossible because of the breakage of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I'm counting on us to find some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were able to eat sweets, stay up for a long time and show it to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a scumbag.
For two years, no candy has appeared in my apartment, and this year it will probably not be different.
However, the statistics show that I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans — 158 million of them — will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and ornaments.
But what I always look forward to on Halloween is the trends.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, 1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year is the last shot of fashion sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy can no longer be just women; food like pizza, hamburger, and carrots can also be sexy.
As for the men, I expect we will see a lot of zombies through the parade of the dead, and I bet the space men of Daft Punk will reach out to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my amazement we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for pets.
So you'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey's, Lizard, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark's.
That's amazing news for the 41 million columbians who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to raid our quarters.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe it or not, 45 million kilograms of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want are corn candies, and yet, according to the National Association of Confectioners around Halloween, they sell almost 16,000 tons.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never solved.
There is nothing more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls" (which is a real prison by the way), "Howl-O-Scream" (scream, scream) and "The house of shock" (House of shock).
In fact, in the United States, there are officially dedicated 1,200 spooky houses, which, according to the American Spooky Houses, have a profit of $500 million, and that includes those amazing photos that you're peeking at of fear and that your friend on Facebook will give you, and you can't get rid of those photos, and the person you like will get rid of them.
And finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
Even when we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we do it from a very young age.
Fortunately for us, the “baby in a pumpkin” trend only started with the Pinterest app last year, so most of us grew up carving a pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with a flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you’re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try cutting their pumpkin weighing almost a ton.
Announced series of Land Rover racing cars
The interior has racing seats and six-point safety belts as well as intercom equipment.
The choice includes improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between individual plants.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The racers who come to Bowler have changed.”
Not everyone is an experienced racer, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an achievable path to world-class races.
We are delighted to be able to offer them this journey in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the hardness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have early elections in two years
Karel Schwarzenberg, chairman of TOP 09, is looking forward to another early election.
A week after the last ones in an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz he said that there is no other way out and every government that came out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last long," Schwarzenberg said, saying he estimated the term of the beginning of the term to be two years.
With the objection that voters will hardly choose otherwise next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the president of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next elections as this year (compared to about 300,000 votes in 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it was clear within two months that there would be an early election, it would strengthen the YES 2011 movement of Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babi<0xC5><0xA1> will lose.
The turbulent situation in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, where Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka after a secret meeting of the leadership of the party in Lancashire said that either he or Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek will remain in the leadership of social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg after his:
"Leaders of the Democratic Party like little boys go after the head of state to allow them to overthrow the party."
"I thought Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I've never seen anything so unexpectedly badly done in my life," the president added.
And to President Zeman (with whom he clashed in the fight for the presidency) he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to seize that party."
The first law has already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was your biggest surprise about the election?
TOP 09 has already formally tabled its first bills in the House, including the Paris Treaties Register, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with the early elections.
The chairman of TOP 09 in an interview for Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz claims that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, the TOP 09 clearly wants to prejudge similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO Martin Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election fight of "stealing" the ANO program with the idea of introducing a register of contracts.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has just sprayed the proposal, which had already entered the second reading of the House.
Firefighters come to rescue a lost puppy trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry
Ruby's cockroach escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was seen in a quarry by a man who was walking the dog.
Firefighters swarmed the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by firefighters who came to rescue him after he somehow trapped himself on a dangerous ledge in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Nine-month-old Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days on his own until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After escaping, when he got into a small accident, they scouted for his lost dog with a fever and posted challenges on social media.
On Wednesday at about 2.15pm, a bright-eyed dogman spotted Ruby stuck on a protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and rushed down to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to pick him up from the rock.
Andy Clayton, the expert commander of the technical rescue team, said: “The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from below.
He didn’t move his eyebrows during the rescue – he was totally frozen.
But now he's fine.
Then he got the cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw a dog is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, the technical rescue team’s expert commander, said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, and apart from exhaustion and dehydration he was fine.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "When I looked at the rescue, I was afraid."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he had exhausted himself too much and collapsed, he would probably have fallen.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very courageous.
We are very grateful to them, they were all just awesome.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
Firefighters were great.
We still don't know how he got there.
Mick Jagger says Katy Perry hasn't been released since she was 18 years old.
During an interview for an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went out after her.
She added: “It was a long time ago and now he is very kind to me.”
In a statement Thursday, Jagger’s 70-year-old representative said he categorically rejected Katy Perry’s ever making proposals.
The representative said, "Maybe you're confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones live show this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted in first place this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another spooky story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that a condition for an independent Scotland to join the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to tales of belt checks at Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wave.
The truth is that Strathclyde newspapers mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as might be expected – this was not reflected in the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if it suits them.
Given that Scotland is not in Schengen now, the offer of continuing non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for whatever they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And also so old that it became an excavation. A journalist duck that "independence means passport control," I heard at least 40 years ago.
Still, there is one interesting idea hidden in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why should we trade the London cumnut for the Brussels cumnut, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
As a result of the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties dedicated to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year – came out of nowhere and had already won nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, essentially “throwing” the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberals) out of the Bundestag.
On domestic soil there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the tight-knit Kazakhs clinging to the national economies by sticking to the common currency, has led many people to believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are running a high budget deficit – this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro that blocks its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in terms of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only way to do this is to cut revenues and public spending, which Germany is encouraging.
With the current problems with the budget and currency, Europe's poor performance is a deeper cause.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline as it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the freezing of wages in the world would not deter the stifling of Europe’s petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a simmering uprising, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that would keep Germany in check and allow Paris to rise to the level of Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a sign of political legitimacy, and has enforced its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won crucial by-elections and pushed the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front is now, with 24% of the vote, the most popular party in France – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot judge that the split of the right will automatically manifest itself positively on the left.
How does Le Pen cope with her newly gained popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use next year's European elections to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament against the single currency.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
In the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European sentiment and attitude towards the single currency will unite and destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but rather will turn into something more free in the sense of “Europe (sovereign) nations”, which General de Gaulle preferred.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will renew their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and close itself to the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of notifying Berlin and Brussels when they should leave us.
I assume that Scotland would do well in a relaxed Europe, provided that it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – oddly enough – the most successful political movement not promoting austerity in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 thanks to an opposition stance against cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of conservatives and libertarians.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence now just to take austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Adults earlier
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind this.
Experts claim that one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so evident in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children’s health and family issues.
Should a mother be scared when her daughters start growing breasts and shaved at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatricians this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time reassuring my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, hair loss on shame and in the armpits and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
For the past 40 years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age at which the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years compared to 12.75 years in 1970.
“When breasts begin to develop, it will be at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem” (Early Puberty in Girls: A Necessary Guide to Coping with This Common Problem).
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what triggers the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spurt before age 8, the girl is considered "premature".
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which can be closely monitored by pediatricians.
Faster growth may be the reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are therapeutic procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to a halt to growth and decay in adulthood.
Recommendations regarding drugs and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the speed of development, the speed of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug use, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that “repressing puberty can alleviate problems with a girl’s behavior and her feelings of being different from her peers.”
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried she might get pregnant, or how she'll handle hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter began menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were indications and we talked about menstruation together, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no consistent set of evidence that hormones are to blame in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped carry out a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9, which associates body fat with the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
Globally, the patterns of early puberty seem to be affected by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another riddle: Although hair on the face and shame appear in boys at a young age, the trend towards full flowering of early puberty is not as evident as it is in girls.
Other physicians attending the American Association of Pediatricians (AAP) conference added additional complexity to this topic.
Acne and hair loss is common even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their child's doctor on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean having to talk to a child before you know it,” said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will probably respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a common part of life.
Na<0xC4><0x8F>a Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> in the role of a housekeeper.
He's got a new job?
Actress Na<0xC4><0x8F>a Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> (62) appeared behind the scenes in the role of a hospitable and she was able to do it very well.
That maybe the favorite Czech actress would plan to change her profession and start a business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> showed up at the James Joyce Irish Pub and brewed beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and I was able to do it right away.
The boss even offered to hire me and let me have a beer.
But I refused, I would rather stay with what I am doing today, with acting," said Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1>, who was a guest at the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey there," she said.
A long-time friend and colleague of Nadi Pavel Nov<0xC3><0xBD> also appeared at the event.
I am after death and in this new life I am not allowed to sniff.
I’m allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I’m trying to stick to that,” he added.
Aircraft manufacturers talk about the width of the seats, big orders are at stake
A dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of second-class seats in long-haul flights raged this month, prompting a bitter exchange of views at an aviation show in Dubai.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided on long-haul flights for the economy class – not exactly the one that would normally have preceded the airlines, but whose allocated space is key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economy class, but major U.S. rival Boeing says it is up to airlines to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell the largest version of their two-engine long-haul aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the November 17-21 event.
The way in which the rear of the aircraft is distributed – especially if there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other – is the basis of economic performance requirements for the design of new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the upgraded 777X will transport 406 people in economy seats more than 43 cm wide, spread out 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 46-cm-wide economic seats spread across 9 seats.
Giant planes often attack each other in technical matters through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of an air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain dominance with more than 100 orders.
Recently, he preliminarily showed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture of three people sealed in a restaurant with the caption “Would you like it?”
“Boeing promotes long-haul flights in seats narrower than they are in regional turboprop aircraft,” said Airbus Chief Sales Officer John Leahy.
As diets change, people are bigger, but the seats on airplanes have not changed radically.
From the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, to the turn of the century, according to the U.S. Department of Health, the weight of an average American aged 40 to 49 has increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average seat width of a newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research that suggests a 2.5-cm extension of the seat will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus’ seat dimensions, saying it is not in the hands of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says research shows that the cabin experience depends on more than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and enabling them to do things they believe they need to do to be successful,” said Kent Craver, an expert in cabin space.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, more space for elbows is essential, but for suppliers, it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this dispute, the race to order planes with an estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices is enough to deflect the scales of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 percent better efficiency in their latest two-engine long-haul aircraft designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing’s performance demands depend in part on the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to push more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“Forty-five centimeters wide would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an Airbus business point of view, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said Mary Kirby, Interior Expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer the airlines a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
Traveling aircraft vendors even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive layout.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for more cabin modification by offering wider seats in the alleys for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard of, but it can deter a wave of sales of the 777X.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague exceeded the thousandth
In the Czech Republic, the number of infections is growing every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121 and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 people were infected, a record number.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, 165 HIV patients increased in the country from January to September last year, this year there were 176 in the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September this year, tests confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
The number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, 206 people were infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravian-Silesian and 116 from <0xC3><0x9A>stecké.
The least infected are from Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients became infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected by a blood transfusion in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, that is, in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, he passed on to them from his mother.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but seen it's beautiful, experts say
The fantastic film from the universe Gravity some time after the premiere sold out cinema in the Czech Republic.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by almost 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most of the reviews rate the picture positively.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
The server Lidovky.cz asked experts from the ranks of astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the film.
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek (Director of Star and Planetarium Brno): I like science fiction films, which I consider modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity does not exclude, even if it is seen as a "physically real" performance.
No, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it very much.
You may notice, for example, the hair Sandry Bullock, which somehow does not rise in a state of weightlessness.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station move along significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in a single image.
Some viewers of the film blame the unreal effect and the entire behavior of the fire in a state of weightlessness.
Scaffolders would not have endured such wounds either.
Heroes in the film Gravity often get into a collision with various objects and suits without much difficulty.
Criticism was not spared even a plot plot.
Such a large-scale tragedy on Earth’s orbit is unrealistic, according to some debaters.
In addition, he wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair the technique.
People also argue in forums about the "unreal" behavior of ropes.
It looks like it was designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Star and Planetarium of Prague): I have only seen it on a wide screen so far, but I can clearly say, I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but a science fiction film.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost the obligation) not to adhere consistently to reality.
"More than the irregularities you mentioned, I was touched by the three-fold display of a space station with a degrading level of technology (the last Chinese one)."
"The Chinese one will not be until the end of the decade, and it will probably look better than it is in the movie."
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful in not violating physical laws, and thus the naturalist viewer will appreciate that in various cosmic collisions and precipitations, the momentum of the swarms is quite correct, and the momentum of the
Inconsistencies will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
In addition, for example, when reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of the circulation of various space debris in the orbit appears to be reversed in some scenes than it actually should be (from west to east).
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things the creators have adapted to their needs, but I have not noticed any fundamental and heaven-calling sins against logic or natural laws in the film and compared to other films of similar focus, the image of the
Of the moments that make no sense, it is worth mentioning the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in an orbit that is different from the ISS.
As a result, the speed of each other is significantly different and the rescue operation could therefore not actually take place as it was shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the time of the division of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS would rotate, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go when they are no longer moving towards each other.
New Nicotine Vaccine May Take Away The Pleasure Of Smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine dependence for a lifetime.
Before testing on humans, additional tests need to be done, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell School of Health in New York says the first signs are good.
“We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhaust all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is so strong that it surpasses all current approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to form a flow of these antibodies.
Antibodies chase all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine attack.
Vaccinated mice, who were given nicotine in addition, continued their normal activities.
But the mice that were not vaccinated “calmed down,” the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine had gotten into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they proved to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower, as it turns liver cells into factories for the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they feel like trying a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
However, it is much more likely that smokers would use it to quit.
“They’ll know that when they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine, they won’t have any pleasure from it, and that will help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Corruption Oversight Committee.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the policy of coastal rentals at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday extended its search to see if Mr. Obeid had been lobbying with several ministers of state to have his rent at Circular Quay, where Obeid owned two restaurants and a café, restored without having to resign after his pick expired in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obed's secret interests in these properties, based on evidence presented Thursday by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy head of the office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks that began in 2005, the government pushed for leases to go to public competitions.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, rents for Circular Quay businesses, which brought in $2.5 million a year to both of them, were renewed without the need to participate in a public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public competitions.
He denied, however, that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rent policy.
The transcript of the calls submitted to the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripod and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the ports after working under Mr. Obeid in the Department of Fisheries.
“Was the subject of the interviews during these phone calls the development of commercial rental policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but not this.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obama.
Israeli military planes attack target in Syria, said a responsible official
Israeli military planes hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, a senior administration official told Fox News.
This responsible official did not specifically say what the target was, but said that he was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out an airstrike on missile supplies in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the commentator Pe<0xC4><0x8D>inka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree, while the chairman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>ch was stirring up controversy.
Heytman Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s misery.
The rest of the men showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, Vice-President Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek has been most disabled by a television interview.
On this basis, I see no better option than for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to propose Vice-President Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>ka for the Prime Minister of the Senate, the only one who would not have an initial disability and I think that she would carry out the standard performance.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone in the leadership will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what has been done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> could, without fear, form a minority government with the mere blessing of President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and without the people, but with the people’s health minister, Hovorka, who is actually a faithful Social Democrat.
This minority government would have a great deal of stability because it would promote a proper referendum law and the president of <0xC3><0x9A>sv<0xC4><0xAB>t Okamura pledged to support it.
President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> would eventually reconcile with the progress of taxation, because he is smart and will see that it cannot be done without it.
The people would not bring trouble, because the Speaker is the bearer of the best that they have, and otherwise they would not be in government.
The same is true of YES, even here a valuable minister would be found, but if they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but provide support, also well.
Let's give Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> the courage!
Foreign workers with a visa authorisation may undergo a “legitimacy” test
As the government plans to extend police interventions, it is considering a “legitimacy” test for foreign workers with a visa permit 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unskilled jobs, or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion paper was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers with the words that it could offend Australian neighbors.
“The loud statements ‘foreigners at the end of the queue’ and ‘work first for Australians’ are a very unpleasant remnant of a time when unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the white workforce had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if anyone in this region recorded the echo of this historical artifact.
The article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is dealing with officials for smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
If the eligibility criteria are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail as to whether "the nomination is eligible for a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal relationship with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking."
After previous experience with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, companies may also be required to justify the number of 457 visa holders.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka who was seeking asylum died on suspicion of a heart attack after arriving this week on an asylum ship to the Christmas Islands.
The man’s nine-year-old frightened son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital in the Christmas Islands, where he died.
The British government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “connects the UK together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase two, the line will lead from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted talks with the national transport office Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 to explore further rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of eventual travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that better connects the UK and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green because the benefit it will bring is huge.
Without it, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also a matter of connectivity – 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected across the UK thanks to the HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
Under the Scottish government, Keith Brown urged Mr Carmichael to “unambiguously” support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed rail has the potential to bring Scotland immense economic benefits, but it also adds to Scotland’s economic weight in the overall case of high-speed rail across the UK.”
We are therefore excited to work with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing a high-speed railway to Scotland to bring benefits to everyone and to complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning to do anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the British ministers over the next year and to making joint decisions on the next steps.
Anti-Corruption Police Inspector and Analyst Arrested Together with Barta
Information about the arrest of V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rty began to spread on Thursday evening, when the message was brought by the server Prvn<0xC3><0xAD>zpravy.cz.
The MF today found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspectorate of the Security Corps (GIBS), its people were to arrest Barta in the center of Prague.
It was in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection deals with cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its jurisdiction also applies to civilians.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - the head of analysts and informatics Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek is among the arrested.
He used to work for the Security Information Service.
Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehey, however, refused to comment on the information with the premise that the media must turn to GIBS in this matter.
However, her spokeswoman, Radka Sandorov<0xC3><0xA1>, did not want to say anything about the case, she turned to the Municipal Prosecutor’s Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," spokeswoman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Also from this non-specific reaction it can be inferred that the event took place, but it is in a mode of secrecy that does not allow speakers to say anything specific.
Bart’s lawyer, Oldrich Chudoba, is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represents Bart "even in this matter", but given that it is classified information, he cannot confirm or refute Bart's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bart’s arrest could be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
This was promoted by B<0xC3><0xA1>rta together with former VV President Radek John, who was at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute that broke out between Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and the VV had to be resolved even by then-President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus.
I don’t know where that connection came from.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about it," Lessy said.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
It was officially enforced by Radek John, the real head of the party, but it was B<0xC3><0xA1>rta at that time.
B<0xC3><0xA1>rta was now running for election for the Dawn movement, but only narrowly missed the parliamentary mandate - by 175 votes.
Dawn leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what it was.
"To see Bart was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate, and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy by Tom Okamura," he distanced himself from the problem of Bart Okamura, who said before the elections that he had given B<0xC3><0xA1>rtov<0xC3><0xA1> a place to the <0xC3><0x9A>vatov<0xC3><0xA1>.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta was in court in 2012 with his former VV collaborator Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>k<0xC3><0xA1>rka.
Rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will continue to have to switch off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, regardless of changes in the US, in order to mitigate regulations regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies space to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in “air mode.”
Passengers can already do this during the majority of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a lot of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in the critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
“CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” he said.
This issue is covered by regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which had already talked to CASA about extending its on-board Wi-Fi entertainment system, was in favour of the change, but announced that it would be subject to a regulatory authority decision.
“We would welcome an analysis of CASA’s authorization to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (wireless onboard entertainment) it would improve the customer experience,” the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with current regulations for the time being.
“Our current policy is that electronic equipment should not be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change that anytime soon,” he said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area that may be useful to our passengers, and we are sure to study the FAA’s decision and the reasons behind it thoroughly.
In the case of U.S. carriers, the impact of regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
"As soon as the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the device during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment during take-off and descent be safely stored under the seats or in the storage space above the head.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, stopovers in Singapore are thriving
Janani Amirthalinga stops her gold bracelet, ring, and earrings at a pawnshop in Singapore's Bendemeer shopping mall to pay her daughter's tuition fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 a month as an administrator (SGD 3,000) and her husband also works, her family’s monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Demand across areas in Southeast Asia — where household debt is rising — is indeed such that ValueMax, where a woman is transacting, has become the third-highest on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – SGD 1,300 in Mrs. Amirthalinga’s case – but it’s also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Singapore-based retailers typically apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, mortgages have the advantage that they do not require a person’s verification (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And therefore, as families feel pressured by rising cost of living and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region turn to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans backed by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to bailouts to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, Standard & Poor's cited rising household credit usage, mainly due to rising rents, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debts in Asia, given the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists also feared high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just gotten out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and weakened consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people from middle to low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the Malaysian bank CIMB.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people captivatingly stopping their personal possessions and taking the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city pawnshops make up gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
Thailand’s largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
ValueMax, the operator of a branch in downtown Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will fund it by using 60 percent of the SGD 66 million it earned this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount creditors have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the collateral not only offers lower rates than other creditors, but also doesn’t directly increase debt.
“Customers stop items that they already own, and the monetization of personal property does not increase the household’s debt,” he says.
In the company, the pledge of assets is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, among those who use pawnshops, it is not just people in financial need.
Wealthy Singaporeans also use ValueMax branches when they stop gold bars or Rolex watches, so they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from all walks of life.
“These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow for the short term because of their bold trades or investments, or small businesses who need help solving problems in their cash flow,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
Rescue package worth $325 million for Tasmanian health care
The federal government is insisting that the $325 million rescue package for dying health care in Tasmania contains harsh conditions that will ensure that the state government does not squander funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is taking "accelerated measures" to avert the crisis caused by the island's aging population, higher numbers of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems the state is facing,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for operations at the patient’s request.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and grayscale operations, will help eliminate debt.
The money is also available for open-access clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved postoperative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the provision of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to ideas that leading clinicians have told me will best help the Tasmanian healthcare system,” Plibersek said.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must demand a strict reporting regime and record-keeping obligations.
The state will need to maintain the current level of funding to receive the Union’s money, and to report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be established to ensure that the State delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be in vain “until a real reform is followed in order to lay a more sustainable foundation for the Tasmanian public health system.”
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first raised during talks with the Prime Minister in early May.
“I believe that the federal aid package can free the state’s public health from a critical state,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Federal Health Opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is just a “flame.”
“The reason I’m here is because the Labour government has taken $430 million out of our health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can’t have a state government that takes away nearly half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that devotes $300 million, and pretend that’s good news.
Mr. Dutton urged Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted the novel by Denise Diderot, which brings an exceptional film journey and portrayal of the times, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in the 1960s in France, she tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she experiences an extremely cruel treatment from the punitively wicked mother of the performer, and for the other she becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips to frivolity or sensationality and that is his problem.
The ceremonial nature of this story leads to the fact that even the spectators will experience a torment similar to the wearing of a skirted shirt.
Ski resorts want to reduce costs for families with children
Syria has destroyed its means for the production of chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria has destroyed critical equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the Global Chemical Weapons Surveillance Committee said on Thursday, as violent conflicts erupted in the north of the country, not far from one of the sites where poisonous substances are believed to be stored.
A Syrian activist group said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The notification of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before 1 November,
the deadline set by that organisation based in The Hague for Damascus to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons and chemical mixing equipment for the purpose of producing poisonous gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this basically initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to manufacture new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons including hyperite and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons factory and storage facilities, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar al-Assad, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 armed men from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Among those killed are 2,202 government runaways and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad’s forces have been fighting in Safira against insurgents, many of whom are al-Qaeda-linked, for weeks.
The Observer said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but it did not have specific numbers.
The fighting has underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, on their mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war, have to deal with tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said that his team is now “pleased to have verified – and monitored the destruction – of Syria’s declared essential production and mixing/filling equipment.”
He added that “no further control activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two locations due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been abandoned and “the chemical weapons program items it contained have been moved to two other declared sites that have been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Sapphire was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I bow to the courage and courage you have shown in carrying out this most demanding mission that this organization has ever had," said Director of Observers Ahmet Uzumcu in a commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam, stand against each other in the civil war.
Regarding further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion inside air defense facilities in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikiya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the conviction of the founder of the bombing of Bali
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted furiously to the verdict against the last of the founders who were brought to justice, saying Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for building explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty in several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution demanded life, even though it could insist that a man nicknamed "Demolition Man" (a fighter) be given the death penalty because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other founders nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
To AAP, Mrs. Corteen said: "It should be built in front of the execution squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not see any more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari club was compared to the ground when, shortly after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002, a heavy load was unleashed outside a parked van.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where a suicide bomber fired a bag full of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, three times the doctors "died".
Mr Hughes said that Patek should face the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jamaa Islam responsible for the massacres – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more isn't that much.
Patek was the last of the assassins in Bali.
He avoided arrest for almost a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to reconnect with terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," Mrs. Corteen said.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for how much grief he caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," Mrs. Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technology in airplanes (but not to call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices “from gate to gate” – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music based on the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
However, passengers do not expect the changes to take place immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA administration that their aircraft are in compliance with the new rules and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and equipment storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already handed over the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the expanded use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
Passengers are currently required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors close.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain issues a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn their devices off again when the plane goes down to land, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and departure, the FAA said.
From most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes, these criteria are expected to be met.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the change.
"As soon as the new rules are safely put in place - and we will work closely with transport companies on it - it will be a success," Glading said in a statement.
To be honest, we’re tired of looking like “watchers.”
However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and text messages or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to flight mode.
So still no Words with Friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, thrown out of an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be stored for fear that they could hurt someone if they flew around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not laid down by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Committee, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but from FCC data we also know that they can cause interference to the broadcast towers in the air,” Rosenker said.
A sectoral advisory committee set up by the FAA administration to investigate the issue proposed last month that the government allow a wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been under pressure in recent years to alleviate restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, argue that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget to turn off their devices or ignore them.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to disruptions to navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical output of the time.
New airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally broadcast much less intense radio broadcasts than those of previous generations.
For example, e-readers only give a minimum broadcast when turning a page.
But broadcasting is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those pushing to release restrictions on the use of these devices by travelers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the transport aircraft with their Kindle e-readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes the disruption from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee have stated that there are only fragmented reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause disruption to air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device while flying under low visibility instruments.
The travel industry group welcomed these changes and said it was a sensible approach for the traveller public, which uses the technology to a large extent.
“We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was airlifted from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was transported to the shore after it was found exhausted on an oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One hawk was transported by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at a rescue centre until he recovered.
Operations Center Colin Seddon said: "This hawk probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught above the North Sea by a strong wind."
He seems to have lost his strength and found refuge on the oil platform.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted for assistance.”
By the time he was released, he was in good shape and in good health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to merge businesses and define what changes in relations with the EU British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked leading UK businessmen their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov interviewed 1,000 executives representing UK businesses of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government preferring new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than meddling in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe’s mysterious institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European business area – even 40 percent of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European companies, agreed.
And finally, our survey of business leaders has revealed the most eloquent insight, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, identified by companies of different sizes and the main business group, show that the business sector is pushing for a ‘meaningful change’ that will bring the impact back to the UK.
There’s a lot at stake – achieving a treaty change and a better deal for Britain can mean a gain of up to 16% when voting in an EU stay referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to update the terms of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mean a significant shift from the current balance of power back towards the UK.
A better deal for Britain is possible, and as the eurozone embarks on a journey towards a narrower economic and fiscal union, it is even more necessary.
Jobs and growth must be a priority in the UK, and as the results of our survey show, for businesses this means a refocus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry: Spying has gone too far!
The United States went "too far" in espionage at times, U.S. diplomat John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the minister, the gathering of information served to deter terrorist attacks.
The "First Confession from Washington," according to AFP, came amid fierce controversy on both shores of the Atlantic over the scandalous revelations about mass surveillance data by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which has also been targeted by US allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the president did, some of these actions have gone too far and we make sure it doesn't happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he defended the practice so far.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of attacks such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding and people were killed because we were able to be informed in time of the plot," Kerry said.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went disproportionately far."
The U.S. intelligence affair, which reportedly followed hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also watching the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their anger, and some of them urged the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prevent or significantly restrict surveillance.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says Bulgaria’s pipeline is ushering in a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom’s director said.
“Today we are witnessing a milestone: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia’s gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials said.
Miller says the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “always” eliminated.
As soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is expected to begin in other countries towards the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of soldiers to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle over the mountainous region of Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n.
Israel reportedly destroyed Hezbollah-designated missiles during Wednesday’s raids on two sites in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shia organization is fighting on the side of the army in Syria.
Its program is also a fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of arms to the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday's Israeli strikes on weapons depots in western Syria are still being clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but U.S. sources confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean area hit the Syrian Sn<0xC3><0xBA>bar Jabla missile base south of Latakia.
The al-Arabiya news station says two warehouses were hit, where the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to her sources, these were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel refused to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Ishay said Syria is constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian air force is teaching members of the Hezbollah armed section to handle missiles.
SA-8s are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are placed on a moving chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions it is possible to easily hide them.
They are equipped with a radar, but it turns off after the missile is fired, so it is difficult to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, an area inhabited by the ruling alawites.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
He says he is helping to protect the Syrian Shia community, to which the Al-Aliites belong.
Now, 15,000 of his fighters are reportedly ready to help the army recapture Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n is located between Damascus and the third largest city in the country, Homs.
The battle is expected to be retaliated by al-Arabia for the recent attack by the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade, Abu Fadl Abbas, in the Shiite part of Damascus.
This year, Hezbollah helped the Syrian army fight back the city of Kusajr on the Lebanese border.
Many insurgents from Kusajru have just left for Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted an early election.
Corruption, wasting money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax hikes and, last but not least, government scandals were cited as the reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be inferred that the majority of citizens were satisfied with this situation.
That they really didn’t mind and with the state that was here (the robbery and indebtedness of this state), they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not vote, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09,384,174 voters voted ODS in total, so 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all eligible voters.
This is the majority of them.
When I added 1,016,829 Czechoslovak voters to the above-mentioned parties, then 64.23% of the eligible voters agreed with the old order (because all the parties mentioned were involved in the "plundering" and indebtedness of this state).
In fact, the majority of voters have shown that they are not for punishing the perpetrators of robbery and over-indebtedness of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who participated in this, will settle for the appropriate laws?
Is he even helping us?

The Royal Commission has learned that two staff members of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) have been charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned that before the charges against child educator Jonathan Lord of the city of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) in New South Wales had been indicted.
But before the commission, it was reported that in its opening statement to the commission, the association stated that it had never dealt with the case of sexual abuse of a child in its organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was questioned on a case where one of YMCA's employees was charged with child pornography offences, and on another when a gymnast in Caringbah from YMCA was convicted in 1991 of sexual harassment of children he had in his
Mr. Hare told Gaila Furness, the committee's adviser, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was also inaccurate when it stated that YMCA had carried out external audits that valued the organization as a leading advocate for children’s rights.
Evidence submitted by the committee indicates that YMCA was alerted to receiving the second lowest of four possible ratings in the August audit of the Ministry of Education and Society.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that his own downwards leadership had failed when Mr. Lord was accepted, without making sure that staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually harassing 12 boys, which he committed during the two years he worked for the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting child safety violations by Mr Lord.
Staff members provided evidence that they witnessed such violations, including Lord being alone with the children, privately guarding them, letting them sit on their knees, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of children's services at the YMCA in the city of Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "a very intimidating and often difficult to deal with."
The Director-General said he did not accept evidence from staff that they felt unaware if they should contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord obscured their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said that he told the Council of the YMCA in New South Wales that the lessons learned from the “Jonathan Lord case” for the organization were that the staff “did not report” and the Council agreed with him.
Mr Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges surfaced was made by YMCA’s general manager of child services, Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid evidence breaches, but it was “excessively zealous” and misconducted.
Professor Stephen Smallbone, a child sexual abuse expert at Griffith University, told the committee that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a child-safe organization between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, checking, hiring, training, and managing staff.
The hearing was adjourned to December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that a return is unlikely.
In an evening interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic politics.
Since June 2007, when he resigned as leader after ten years, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks on British politics and has confined his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy of the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his response to the London Evening Standard newspaper read: “Yes, of course, but it’s probably hard to do that, so...”
While crowds of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although not yet going to school and only a few months ago made the first steps, this boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly slipped through three laps to finally win the main prize and leave behind 30 dragging adult rivals.
This inseparable pair – with the same height – was praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, folded his beard into a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control the horse, which far exceeds his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee got his third birthday in March and has been practicing daily with this Shetland pony ever since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee work great together.”
They didn’t have much hope, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought of him as phenomenal and completely stranger people wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded.”
He ran on the sand along the entire length of the arena, and although he acted so petty, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors, and a farm and has two chickens in charge.
Since he started, he will be at the Horse of the Year competition again soon and I am sure he will be doing well.
A spokeswoman for the annual horse show said, “Fenton has only three, but he already knows how to control the pony.”
They make a great team together.
The jurors picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They’re always watching how good teamwork is between the pony and who’s leading him – and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's lovely clothes helped too, he really fit in with him.
Excessive Newspapers Should Be Investigated
Chinese newspapers, which on the front page asked for the release of the reporter accused of slander, will be thoroughly investigated, the administrator told the press.
Guangzhou-based New Express newspapers have made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes to make up stories about a partially state-owned company.
The administrator said New Express newspapers will now make a "full correction".
The "correction" order came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Kuang-tung Province.
A preliminary investigation has shown that between September 2012 and August 2013, New Express of the Yangcheng group Evening News published several false reports about Zoomlion.
"The editorial board of New Express newspapers was messy," he said in a statement.
He said he had to decide "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a cancellation of the journalist's license."
He also “instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a comprehensive correction of the New Express, and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately change the leadership of the New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express that dealt with financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper issued two requests for his release on the front page, claiming that he was behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had issued false stories for a bribe.
“In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told state news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was craving money and fame.
I realize I've been doing the wrong thing.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he issued a New Express cover letter apologizing for failing to carry out an adequate review of his reports.
Recently, several heavily watched suspects made a confession on television.
Experts say confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of this year’s amendment to the law that forbids authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
U.S.-Mexico Drug Trafficking Tunnel Found With Own Railroad
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico has been discovered, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail.
U.S. officials have described a tunnel measuring about one meter at a time as one of the most elaborate secret passageways they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which spans nearly six football pitches, connects warehouses near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of undetermined warehouses, where it is easy to hide trucks before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel had been closed before drugs could be unnoticed in it.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men, who were believed to have worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
In the event of conviction, he faces imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October following a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a challenge to drug cartels as quickly as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor about 650 meters long equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
The economy and the center connect management.
They offer, for example, joint advertising.
New integrated newsroom of Economia in Karl<0xC3><0xAD>n, Prague.
Economia has taken another step towards transforming Centrum’s holding company into its media house.
Since Friday, the Economy and the Centre have joint top management.
"The unification of the organisational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of the two publishers into a common media house," commented Kamil <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k, Vice-President of the Board of Economics and Chief Executive Officer.
<0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k, who will lead the joint management, will be joined by Andreas Demuth, Managing Director of Centrum Holdings.
The new joint director of the trade was appointed Pavel Voparil, to whom the advertising director of both companies, Zuzana Til<0xC4><0x8D>erov<0xC3><0xA1>, is also subordinated.
The new head of information technology became <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n Burda.
The joint editor-in-chief is Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pisk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, whose team also includes the director for transformation Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pitts was appointed to the newly established position of Marketing Director.
V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Lhotsk<0xC3><0xA1> manages a separate department of corporate communication.
The joint financial director is Karel <0xC5><0xBD>alud, the human resources management for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slab<0xC3><0xA1>.
"The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to enter the market with a joint offer of advertising products, to better connect the creation of the content of all issued titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company's business management," <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k added.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the owner of Economia, has signed a contract to acquire Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The portfolio of Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, <0xC5><0xBD>ena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or a portfolio of almost two dozen other smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny, the news server IHNED.cz, the weekly magazines Respekt and Ekonom and the number of printed and internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it is the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
This year in June, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Prague’s Karl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
CME is targeting the TV business.
Almost a quarter of the people will be released.
The CME media group will be fired.
By the end of the year, he wants to lose a thousand people.
She intends to cut all the side activities and only wants to focus on her main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4,500 people.
Nearly a quarter of people will lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV No. 1 TV Nova, it is not yet clear.
"It's premature and we can't really comment on it," said Nova's communications director Josef Koukol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
According to the MF today, a significant dismissal of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact this should have on the staffing of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new Nova bosses Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who came after long-time CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a conference call Wednesday with analysts about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce, in particular, the cost of producing its own shows, filmmaking and production activities.
At the <0xC4><0x8C>KD industrial site in Prague, a cooling tower burned at night
A large-capacity tank was burning at the <0xC4><0x8C>KD industrial site in Prague, according to the firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
"Firefighters drove out to the fire already on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, this morning they were still catching fire," Prague firefighters spokeswoman Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na Adamcov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The amount of pollutants in the surrounding air as measured did not exceed the permitted limits.
The extent of the damage and the cause of the fire are not yet known.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the site in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a fire of a large-capacity tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamco said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we fire from the cisterns using the transport line," she added.
According to the server tn.cz complicated extinguishing the malfunctioning network of hydrants, so the firefighters had to transport water from elsewhere.
The commander of the fire brigade declared the second stage of the fire alarm.
The grades are four, and in the most serious situations the fourth is declared.
Chemists also went to the site to check the level of hazardous substances that could get into the air in the event of a fire.
"But they didn't measure the amount of pollutants in the air that would exceed hygiene standards," a firefighters spokesman said.
British police have notified Assange of his release.
The British police today delivered a notice of the release of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old had delivered a “notification of extradition” to the Australian by asking him to appear at the police station and that if he did not do so, he could be in danger of being arrested.
Assange has exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition this month, facing extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he sought asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard “delivered notice of release to a 40-year-old man who is requesting that he show up at the police station on the day and hour that were set for him,” a spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail terms.
The embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the release notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face espionage charges, as he has published 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving more than 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found out he had a cup of drink between his thighs.
At the Colchester police court, Howie confessed to the charge of driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a <0xC2><0xA3>100 surcharge for the defendant.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble bursts
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the return of financial assets, but is waiting for the final decision of Mr. Osborn, who in the 2012 budget presented a 7% fee for the transfer of real estate for buildings at a price of over <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
Revenue from the property transfer fee in the housing fund in the districts of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which in the fiscal year 2012/13 reached <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, the North West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “Given the increase in the transfer of high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is under-taxed regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system.”
He added that "this move may have caused some foreign investors to reluctantly buy property in London or to reluctantly sell existing owners."
Front-end properties – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the rich belt ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon saw a record 11.8% increase over the past year.
Prices in central London continue to show year-on-year steady growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by a thriving “domestic market” in which, according to a survey by Savills Real Estate, there were increases in the southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%).
Scientists shed more light on how tail movements are related to a dog’s mood
Previous research has shown that happy dogs spin their tails more to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs wave their tails mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs are able to detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: "It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain have different links to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
We tried to do the same for other species.
He added that just as in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements, and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to gain more information about how dogs react to other dogs’ disproportionate tail drilling, the researchers monitored animals watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Apparently, it won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown dogs films about dogs – whether in the natural version or in the form of a silhouette – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and show it more to the right or left.”
When the animals saw the otherwise inconspicuous dog move its tail to the right (from the view of the dog spinning its tail), she remained absolutely calm.
But when she recorded the shooting of the tail mostly to the left (again from the sight of the dog whirling with the tail), their heart rate increased and the animals seemed uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, it is believed that dogs have learned from experience what movements they must and do not have to pay attention to.
He said, "If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior and the movement to the right produces less friendly behavior, you will react based on this experience."
The researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a university professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides are important for dogs.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they watch an aggressive dog, and to the right when they watch a cheerful dog.
And in another paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs were more likely to be introduced to the dog robot when he was spinning his tail to the left than to the right when they were becoming insecure — quite the opposite of an Italian study.”
The difference, he said, may be that dogs in these different studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the dog robots quite like dogs.
He explained that studies on how dogs react to real dogs could help.
“Although there is strong evidence in many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved to Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro urban complex on Friday.
However, the illness of lead singer Alex Turner forced her to reschedule.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to postpone today’s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and based on medical advice, Arctic Monkeys will also have to postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1.
"Alexa Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately will not be able to get out."
The show will take place at the LG Arena in Birmingham on 20 November and at the Hydro Complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances will remain valid.
We would like to apologise to all those who have bought tickets for the inconvenience caused to them.

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis was appointing new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
Cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church immediately after the pope and are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – the group is reduced to 120 electoral cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the solemn promotion of the new cardinals, a gathering of contemporary cardinals known as the Consistory will take place.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene a February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals likely to fall by February.
He said that the Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of electors again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe for Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Pope Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who were tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was “quite possible” that these cardinals would be asked by the pope for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before – it’s completely new.
Valero said the popes had traditionally elevated bishops from large places to cardinals, but Francis was “full of surprise – so we don’t know who he is appointing.”
GM is pulling out some new light trucks in the U.S. due to seat back repairs
According to a report released Friday by the U.S. Auto Safety Authority, General Motors is downloading nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to fix a fault with the manual tilting of the backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the mechanism for tilting the front seats may be faulty.
As a result, seat backrests do not comply with federal car safety standards for headrests.
A notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website says that “if a car gets hit from behind, the head restraint does not need to protect passengers properly, increasing the risk of injury.”
Downloaded models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched its delivery in June and for this leading American carmaker, it is the most important launch of the vehicle since the restructuring after the bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the delivery of the failure in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the announcements to owners due to a 16-day government failure that weakened car sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverados and 16,503 Sierras.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Desperate Cry of Obama's Voters
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope for a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have eroded the Republican Party's obstructions
The obstruction policy cannot excuse the plight of Obama’s healthcare website or drone attacks
The memoirs of the 2008 Obama campaign are a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris studied medicine at Harvard for the second year.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
About this book, I thought that during the cloudy days of my second year in medical school, it would encourage me and restore a pinch of hope in me.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and is reminiscent of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews tonight and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath away.
The elections ended in overwhelming dominance, and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents were hiding the newspapers they had picked up.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
During his inauguration in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And here I close the book.
Going into the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, sad memories of missed opportunities.
In the years after I put in my first ballot, there really was a change.
It was definitely none of what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse successes – from the Affordable Care Act to the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy of “nothing to ask, nothing to say” after the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I am convinced that the party obstructions have reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: among other things, it is immigration reform, the public’s choice of healthcare, and the closure of a base in Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo.
But after many situations where I defended the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and friends, I have reached the absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I was in a place of political despair.
The obstruction of Republicans cannot explain consent to the interrogation of foreign leaders or to drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans, or that it persecutes those who reveal government misconduct.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without proper trial or for limiting public contributions and spending during the presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify a report finding that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “more aggressive ... than the Nixon administration.”
And the most recent can not even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after the signing of the law on accessible care of a simple website.
I don't know if something like that could have been expected.
Should I have guessed at the age of 18 that the government might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it?
The elected office obviously has no predictable course, and our public conversations will be shaped by the opposition political party and random events such as the Newton Massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above seem largely to be the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unwieldy alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we once heard about.
Yet the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
It forces me to remember the series of promises that have been lost.
This week I read a chapter in a book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that they had to get back to the pace and stay true to their mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The thoughts expressed in this commentary are solely the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott is at odds over parental leave program
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is at odds over a parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
A mining tycoon who is leading a dispute over the payment of a $6 million coal tax bill made this claim as he tried to get the question out of the table as to whether it was a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate that play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that there could only be ministers in conflict of interest, adding that Abbott’s daughters were in a position where they could benefit personally from the policy.
“He got into a big conflict of interest when it came to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would get parental leave,” Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, after counting the votes, she officially declared Mr. Palmer as the winner in the fight for the chair for the Fairfax district of the Sunshine Coast thanks to the gain of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the polling stations are closed?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately, and have the results at half past seven in the evening?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it that the results can be erased if someone does not like them?
These days and at this time the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has been studying the possibilities of electronic voting and has recently made a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political agenda also applies to airports in the Sunshine Coast area and that he would take his new job “very seriously”.
A public office is a service to the public.
“We are not seeking any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time,” he said.
Wash your hands?
Scientists have come to the conclusion that washing your hands will change your order.
The experiment involved 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an unsolvable task.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group, which had failed to wash their hands, had a much more optimistic impression than the one where its participants hadn’t washed their hands.
Also, the "washed hands" group performed better in the next test than the other.
However, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not wash their hands.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not notice any previous failures.
The results of the test indicate, according to psychologists, that physical cleanliness actually eliminates negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, the motivation decreases, the test subjects have to concentrate much more in the next tests.
If we transferred the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, not only one percent of Czechs and Czechs wash their hands, but on the way by city transport it is already a fifth.
They usually stick to hygiene after working in the garden or in the workshop, where 85% of people wash their hands.
Stalking a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey has revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after giving a hand to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey found that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be on the spot, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little better," said dermatologist Klaudia Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign exchange division, which is another indication that global investigations by supervisory authorities regarding suspected currency market manipulations are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities on investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
These two traders would be the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of an expanding investigation, which is a response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Rate of Interest) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, people close to the event reported that RBS had forwarded to the UK Financial Conduct Authority records of emails and instant messages sent from accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is presumed to have been relieved of his current position as European Chairman of Foreign Currency Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European president of cash trading at Citi, took a break this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were charged with any offence.
Mr Usher’s group for sending instant messages included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people dedicated to the event said.
UBS said this week that after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced that it was investigating suspicious foreign exchange transactions in several Swiss banks, it had taken action against some of its employees.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating claims that these bankers have rallied to move with the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are combing through years-old instant messages and emails to find cases of some misconduct.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest engines of profit-making in investment bank closures in recent years, but which has been disrupted by a small currency volatility that has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation by claiming that with a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market it is virtually impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say it may not necessarily be true.
A high-profile trader said that despite the significant volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the liquidity crunch between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day Credit Suisse announced it had released a trader from its stock trading department this week who caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the competent authorities and cooperates with their supervisory authorities.
“We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem was solved,” Credit Suisse said in a statement.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague exceeds one thousand
Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of surveillance in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of this year, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This results from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Institute of Health.
According to her, 2,063 people have been infected in the Czech Republic so far.
In 396, the disease of immunity failure has already erupted.
198 people died.
The number of infections in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year over the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, 156 new infections were detected and 180 in 2010.
Last year, the number dropped to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of the year in 2011, tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD> said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three new patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has spread to 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected people were in Prague.
If you really want to get to know a city, you should go to a cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through a crowded centre with monuments, churches and galleries, more than a bedchamber would reveal.
Many people “read from the graves.”
They slowly roam the cemeteries and gain an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out how people live here, what nationalities they are, what faiths they belong to, how large and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what their taste is.
And from the state of the graves, they will also find out how their dead are cared for by the survivors.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama is consistent with the constitution, a crucial victory for the Obama administration.
By a vote of 5:4, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which directs citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise they risk paying a fine – does not contradict the constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
The president of the court, John Roberts, was on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also backed the remaining parts of the 2,700-page law and further ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which mandates states to extend the possibility of obtaining health insurance, otherwise threatens to eliminate all funding for health insurance from federal sources.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises to block this law.
During the 2012 primaries, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the alleged proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
For the words "Mugabe is a fluffy donkey" no longer threatens prison, the court canceled the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to how they speak in public about Mugabe, a ninety-nine-year-old who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and has been at the forefront since the end of 1987.
Under section 33 of the Criminal Code, a fine of $100 to one year could be imposed for defamation of the presidential office.
"State officials should not be blaming people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the court said in a statement.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to appeal the court’s decision, the BBC reported.
Against the law, a number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in a fight with a policeman at a bar, were loudly identified.
In May, an opposition activist accusing Mugabe of "bull donkey" in public ended up in prison.
In August, the prosecutor accused a 26-year-old man of his intention to use Robert Mugabe's face poster as toilet paper.
The court also declared it an unconstitutional law restricting the freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements will later turn out to be false," Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala said.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
“The existence of a law that criminalizes someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to freedom of expression,” Malala said.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has been ruling the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in March on the basis of a referendum.
Small steps in the direction of one man’s dictatorship began in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition took Morgan Tsvangirai to the prime minister’s seat.
However, the country continues to be troubled by the economic crisis and by 2008 the world’s highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government abolished the national currency.
Today, in Zimbabwe, only the currencies of other countries are used.
The impoverished economy is at the mercy of Mugabe’s reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
However, most of them had no experience with farming.
Central Banks Will Keep Swap Lines Permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need to.
This was stated by the banks in their joint statement.
“This is a very sensible step,” commented Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays.
"So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so that is no surprise to me," adds Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began to form in 2007, when the international credit market crashed for the first time.
Central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies for anyone who needed them.
The central bankers’ decision comes at a time when the U.S. Fed is preparing to end its program to support the U.S. economy, which could push the price of money in the global market even higher.
By default, the swap contract is used to overcome the liquidity deficit of one currency while simultaneously over-liquidity of the other currency.
It can be understood as the storage of one currency and the loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (does not) delete personal information.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on the site Tipsport.cz.
However, I did not finish there afterwards, because there was just someone sitting at the branch who could not complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn’t want to go to another branch, the registration expired, then I moved and that changed my address and ID number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it is not possible, because I have a different OP number, address and that it is simply not possible to complete it and that I have to request to delete the data and make a new registration.
This is what I did and on 24.10.2013 I wrote to technical support that I am requesting the deletion of all my personal data from the database in accordance with the applicable data protection law.
On that rainy day, technical support wrote to me that I should complete the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of technical support emails, where finally after the 4th Hurricane on 25.10. they wrote that they had deleted personal data at my request.
One would think that he could make that new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not a personal data, but in the end they also deleted this).
So I used a different username and it popped up on me that my personal data has already been stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
When I was asked how it was possible, they wrote me off that personal data was actually deleted on 25.10. and to send an email with that error.
I did this yesterday (around 3 p.m.) and they wrote me today that I registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that it is not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
I've been contacting technical support for a week now and I'm dealing with them that it still can't be done.
And what about the fact that if it were true what they claim (as it is not) no one could register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way in those 13.22 I actually registered, to the same name and date of birth, but I used the imaginary e-mail and phone number and the world of wonder, I found a page that sent me a link to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register with the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport does not link registration to e-mail and phone number and data as they claim.
So again I have communicated this to the technical support that they are simply lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they are writing), because what they are writing is not true.
I proved several screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so the "false" registration simply does not affect this.
Tipsport wrote me a strict sentence - I'm sorry, but because you're already registered again, we can't verify your claim.
And the communication ended.
It repeats the same phrase, respectively, that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and did not actually take place.
So if I sum it up, Tipsport not only didn’t extract the data as it claims, but it still lies when it claims otherwise.
The worse it is, it can be easily proven how they lie and try to make it look like the mistake is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after putting this issue on my personal blog, things started to move a bit and from Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter is submitted for verification and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and consultation and notification of the same error).
In the subway there is music playing on the bridge
The Transport Company of Prague (DPP) has launched the Music in the Metro project.
The first vestibule, where reproducible instrumental music is played continuously during the operation of the metro, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek presents his new double album, band and three singers
Texter Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek brought to the Hall of the Cologne City Social House not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar, but above all in the show Between us singers Lenka Nova, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by the excellent Orchestra Mat<0xC4><0x9B>je Benk.
After the intro and the acting studio about the late musician, Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek gradually invited all three singers to the stage, himself came up with a candle in his hand and thus reminded the story of how they last played in Cologne and in the theater and the electric current fell out throughout the city.
"Otherwise, in Cologne they produced two types of cards with which I came into contact a lot," he recalled.
He also reminded the native of President Zeman.
"Perhaps we could do a tour of Z<0xC3><0xA1>kolany or Dubravka near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not leave the stage and, if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical act.
The calendar was also made by Josef M<0xC3><0xA1>nes, who put it on the clock, about ice hockey but at that time he had no idea how we meet in those squares and chant, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That's the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we won't play you here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sung from this album very suitable for him to sleep in the day, sing at night and accompanied her on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played drums, all three singers were accompanied by a band consisting of a keyboard, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three singers sang a little song together In the side of the heart sits, which immediately scattered the audience.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which didn't surprise me in the town of Kmoch," Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
After remembering Petr Hapka, I heard Rozzn<0xC3><0xA1>m in a presentation by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller rewarded with a huge applause, Hana Heger’s song was also remembered by Dad, who liked L<0xC3><0xAD>da Baar and with Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s explanation of the communist heresy.
Composer Michael Koc<0xC3><0xA1>b was reminded of the composition Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n, Segrado then sang the wonderful composition of Prague by Jarda Svobod<0xC3><0xA1>, a zasmuck<0xC3><0xBD> native and former Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n<0xC3><0xA1>k.
But that was the conclusion, the applause in the stands and the additions in the form of an optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
There was another addition on the playlist, but the fans were no longer applauding it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole band sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, his books and even the packaging from the legendary LP and with any interested parties, she also took pictures.
Berdycha and <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek complement Rosol and H<0xC3><0xA1>jek
At the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til nominated Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Berdych, Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosol, Jan H<0xC3><0xA1>jek.
Czech representatives defend the trophy, but go to play on the opponent's pitch to the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in five years.
“We know we’re going to hot ground, it’s going to be wild, and we have to focus on our performance as always.”
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek, the creator of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.

U.S. Command in Libya.
Top Gun in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis showed exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats, and millions of statements, they sent planes, they hit the target, and they came back.
Without allowing themselves to be swayed by the official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole action and are no longer expressing it.
Precisely the opposite of confused and bigoted, the actions of Obama’s unsupportive Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don’t let the media confuse you with their claims that the “Syrian base” or “deliveries for Hezbollah” were bombed.
I wrote here recently about the fact that while U.S. aid to secular rebels in the country remains only rhetorical, Russia is happily continuing to supply weapons to Syria.
And it was the fresh supply of Russian missiles deployed in the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli attack.
That's a clear message.
And note, Israel was again bombing the Assad regime, not the insurgents, although according to popular internet theories it should be the opposite.
The U.S. government has awarded two members of space units, most likely the Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they were distinguished during the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.
There is a known heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city, according to me they were members of the secret CIA command, which is made up of former soldiers.
It has long been speculated what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at another CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
Anyway, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (it was on one such that both SEAL members died after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received a report of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, shot their way to the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is blaming the fact that during that attack, that command was not officially deployed and that it was simply hesitating what to do.
The commander of the command, so without orders apparently release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that the country is not a one-time operation, but a permanent US team, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
This is due to the fact that until recently nothing like this was officially admitted and even now we are talking only about a NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the US is trying to fight terrorism in Libya, even if half of it.
Although to solve the national situation, it would require much more help.
The last place of a secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost chanted to the Iranian air force for pursuing American drones.
However, little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to find your drone in airspace, nothing can be done about it.
However, if the Iranians discover a drone in the international space, the situation is completely different.
So it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom aircraft was chasing an American drone in international space over the sea, when there was perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He subdued the Phantom to optically verify his armament without the Phantom registering it on the radar or simply noticing it and then when he suddenly appeared at his house and invited the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without hesitation.
It’s no surprise that the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare to Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has mostly failed in the finals, defender or midfielder Viktoria Pilsen Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral has a form that has brought him back to the national team after a year.
He is also successful in shooting, he is active, after the procedure he was ordered a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Victoria reached the final two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but in the end she took a single point from these two duels.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series in a match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a tough match against the North Bohemians, who play attacking football.
Everything is heading towards a match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as we always draw a lot from the video game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great game on Friday night," said the Czech representative of the fans at the Doosan Arena tribune.
The last few games didn't go as well as she wanted, but defender Victoria rejects the word of crisis.
That's what happens in football, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes you're in worse shape.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis at all.
"I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again," said the defender of the West.
Victoria's team will once again rely on the support of fans.
"It's played on Friday night and that's what I would like to invite our fans, who are great."
"I believe we'll repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Jana Pétov<0xC3><0xA1>: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big leap - a leap a few years back, into memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash dishes, luxuriate and do your homework.
Although these "duties", it was mostly just a theory, the parents' wishes.
The practice was completely different - to run from school, throw a bag in the corner and run out.
Play with other children's ball games, jump a drink.
Then during the series Helena and her boys embroidered with a chain stitch a festive tablecloth for grandma for her birthday.
And then after a few warnings to finally wash the dishes, luxuriate, in winter apply the wood to the tiles and do the tasks until after dark under the lamp (or rely on the classmate and instead of the tasks to write the beloved verses addressed to the school love).
Breakfast in the morning with homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold now, the contents of which next to the strawberries did not even lie) and drink it with tea from dried herbs, which my mother and I so loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was grave silence in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio to the cassettes that were rolling loudly in the old cassette box after my mother.
And then we flipped the cassettes over on the pencil and played the same song all the time, our favorite, and then we had a siphon to it.
Or we phoned over the table with the help of cans that were tied together by a string - and when we were already on the phone to hear each other better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, the then ucho<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC5><0xAF>ur was a syrka + vata.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now and my parents were able to live from it so that we lacked nothing.
We didn’t need any of those iPhones, iPads or even cell phones and laptops or branded clothing.
The clothes were inherited from generation to generation and the best "stuff" in the wardrobe was a batiked T-shirt of homemade with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics was enough to our satisfaction mentioned mom's cassette tape and at most Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which we used by the way just in the train on the school trip.
We thought it was more interesting to play with Aunt Hop Hat or Man, don't be mad, or as I have already said go "only" out.
When I was a little older we got a video player under the tree, my parents probably saved on it for a long time, but unfortunately it did not get warm in our house for a long time.
My younger sister snatched a squirrel into it, supposedly so beautifully popping the tapes, so she tried to see if the squirrel was sleeping too.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last breath.
Well, he's still got this thing on his dad's plate, poor guy.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she rubbed a squirrel into a video and thought she was going to get a recipe and not win, so she still can't bake it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate together, make an appointment without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I had an appointment with a neighbor's granddaughter on a holiday at her grandmother's house, when we'll meet again next summer at her grandmother's house - and that's how it was, that's how it was.
We've met.
Can you promise to see someone in a year?
I also remember the winter when we ran outside with the whole village, built snowmobiles, rode on a snowy hill near the church on hay-packed bags.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear the notorious phrase, "Run to wash your hands!" before every dinner.
Yes, this is true even today, but you certainly do not have soap tied to the faucet in the lemon net in the bathroom.
After dinner, when my dad "worked" in the garage at a beer with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay on the floor, leaned our feet against the tiled stove, opened the door and looked at the flames, and listened to the cracking of the wood that lingered from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on social media, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated - we talked - we did not write messages to each other every day through different chats, SMS messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew much more about ourselves.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It is nice to remember, especially if I supplement these memories by looking at the albums, where black and white photos are neatly pasted with black corners.
And if I didn't know how old I was then, the back of the photo is always written the year of taking the picture.
I see that even though the cuts according to the pot did not suit us very well and in addition we had pants after the cousin by two numbers bigger, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back one step further - to reality.
Until 2013 and I will be waiting for what the modern era will come up with, for example, for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories are now for the young teenage generation so at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they miss a lot that they will not experience this "presumptive" time either.
I'd wish it on them!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of expired Nortel patents, filed a patent infringement lawsuit on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers including Google, a company it overtook in an auction under the bankruptcy of Nortel.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel’s patents for $4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been charged with infringing seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps link online search terms with relevant ads, the lawsuit says, which is the core of Google’s search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are producing phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which competes heavily with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made a $900 million initial price offer for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offering several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the patent battle, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal partly driven by Motorola's patent group.
"Despite the failure to seek patents at auction that are the subject of the dispute, Google has infringed and continues to infringe patents," the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because, according to it, Google intentionally infringes a patent, as the lawsuit claims.
Miloslava Cejpkov<0xC3><0xA1>: The November Smile
It came from the outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to.
At first she put down her smile, the one that kept on display as a defense against the pleasures of a friendly environment.
She was relieved, because it was a mask that she decided not to put off in public.
He was honest at home only in the days when she was a grandmother and had Elinka or Ad<0xC3><0xAD>k's grandchildren around her.
And, of course, when her sons phoned her.
She remembered very well the lesson from the endless courses of business skills.
Now they're really good.
Not to grieve his neighbor.
Then he flew to the corner.
Like a disguise on a mask.
November, no other month can do that miracle to make her really smile, like when they were on a trip with one who hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt Appoints First Freely Elected President
Muhammad Mursi took the inaugural oath, but his triumphant day hardly ends the political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was solemnly sworn in as the country’s first freely elected president, after Husni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
When he was put in office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges dressed in black talars in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today have laid the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old U.S.-educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of fierce attacks by individual governments for most of the 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization.
When Mursi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small column of cars, hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak’s presidential glamor, traffic was briefly halted so that the column could traverse the usually busy road connecting the city centre with suburbs in the south.
Mursi’s personal prestige, mockingly referred to as the Muslim Brotherhood’s uncharismatic “reserving tire,” has grown sharply since his victory and Friday’s speech aimed at presenting him not only as a candidate for the Islamists, but also all those who want to bring the Mumu’s uprising to an end.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie, told judges in a wood-lined chamber where he took an oath.
Mursi later traveled to the University of Cairo, where he was to deliver an inaugural speech.
While he stood on guard, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
Military commander Field Marshal Husayn Tantavi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by chanting “the army and the people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later became a bastion of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly promised to seize the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took them from him.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he submitted to the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech on Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There will probably be police specialists in the ghettos, they have to alleviate tensions
In the future, police specialists should be active in the ghettos in the Czech Republic.
They'd spend half of their time here.
They would take care of the order and solve the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and people from around them.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior is counting on this.
According to him, improving the situation in the country would mainly help "accelerated provision of social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living there, mostly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
It's bullshit.
According to the experts of the problem locations, meanwhile, it has increased by a hundred.
Relationships between their residents and others are intensifying.
Anti-Romani marches were held in several places.
People from the surrounding areas also joined the extremists.
According to the interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
The fundamental condition is "consistent application of equal access in law enforcement".
However, it is not possible to achieve this without detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would go on walks in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled locality, he'd take care of the order.
He would also know the local, so he could better solve problems or transgressions.
"Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be able to more easily prevent a whole series of illegal acts," the intern said.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive surcharges of 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers in problem areas is to be paid from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations have started this year, a detailed proposal is now being prepared.
The project is expected to run until 2016.
The authors were inspired by their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the authors of the report said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will determine the places where a special policeman would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the end of the project.
According to the project proposal, selected police officers first complete an internship in Slovakia.
Each year, five dozen members are expected to undergo this training.
The most suitable candidates will come from them.
There should also be special training for police officers who will work in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the idea of the interior, it should have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet hostels with precisely set rules, such as the number of people per room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard should be social housing, which would be comparable to ordinary housing.
Tenants would have to implement an integration plan drawn up with them by social workers.
They would have to comply with the accommodation regulations, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would move on to a higher standard of living.
The transitional housing system should operate internally for at least 30 years until the next generation grows "in a pro-integratively motivated environment".
The social housing model is being prepared by resorts for local development and work.
They have to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Dr<0xC3><0xA1>bek: Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l.
Along with several others, evidence of volcanic activity in the Lower Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k at the time (from a geological point of view) is recent.
The last eruption was at the beginning of the quarter.
Looking from a greater distance, there is a striking white plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary Pomocn<0xC3><0xA1>, built in the years 1755 - 1765.
It replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn next to the church did not survive.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley of four rows of lip, about 1 km long, was planted.
The crossroads on the Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ské vrch is already the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001, lasted only until 2004.
On the fifteen stops are wooden sculptures made by the local art carver Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Nedomlel.
He used different types of woods from the Low Autumn area.
Similarly, the pedestals from the rocks of the local area form an interesting geological exposition.
The name of the sponsor is also indicated on each stop.
The coal mountain is the remnant of a young volcano.
Although data from radiometric age measurements vary somewhat, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Red Riding Hood (3.3 million years old) and older than Venus's volcano (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born by an explosion.
She threw out a considerable amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the substrate, which by burning obtained a reddish-brown color.
At the end of this phase, lava leaked to the surface - today it is a layer of porous plaster up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption ejected red, brown-red, and patches of black tufas.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and part of it is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In the tufts there are noticeable volcanic buds up to 1 meter in size. The second eruption was also ended with the pouring of lava.
At the end of the activity, lava leaked from the volcano, which today forms up to 50 m of a powerful layer of ostrich burdock.
Volcanoes, in which the ejection of volcanic ash alternates with lava flows, are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they are called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually subject to erosion.
However, it was only threatened by the mining of rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here in the years 1953 - 1962.
Tufas were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Under the pressure of experts and the public, the mine was able to stop and thus preserve this unique place.
The problem, however, is the porosity and small coherence of rocks, which quickly ventilate, disintegrate and descend down a slope.
The rupture disappears fairly quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
Correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can reach Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch by the green tourist sign from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l, or from Slezsk<0xC3><0xBD> Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ov.
Motorists can use the free parking at the beginning of the street, where the short educational trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the pantry.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a communal villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts on Orechovice.
However, the original owners of the house acquired it in restitution and the tenants had to move with a small distance.
Ivana was therefore quickly looking for a replacement home for herself and her older mother at the time.
From acquaintances she got a tip for an apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the extensive forest park and the dam on the other hand fascinated me," Ivana recalls the first impression.
At first I thought it was going to be a three-year provisorium.
"We live here today for more than thirteen years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction, I would not change," adds the owner.
The mother and daughter then moved from a one-hundred-foot apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and distributed almost all the equipment.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but the necessary adjustments had to be made, for example, varnishing the doors or replacing the windows.
The previous owner destroyed the core, but the owner was most troubled by the impractical and unnecessarily large hallway, and, conversely, a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to define individual zones and divide the room, which allowed the new placement of lights.
The first step she decided to take after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to the partial improvement of the standard was to replace the PVC floor with laminate.
Ivana had no idea about the bathroom.
For years I have been collecting magazines about housing and looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So I addressed the recommendation to the young architect Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rova.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana says.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the available hallway.
The architect connected the space of the toilet and the bathroom and replaced the two doors with open wings with one sliding one, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently barrier-free.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, in the toilet a bidet shower.
The successful cooperation with Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rova continued.
Within the program How to build a dream, a rapid but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin <0xC4><0x8C>en<0xC4><0x9B>k also participated.
In the space created by combining two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classical principles of optical division, for example, semi-transparent or Japanese walls.
"As a result, this would violate the openness and unity of space," explains the architect.
Originally, the bedroom and living room were separated.
It was enough to turn the backs of two sofas and build a tailor-made box for feathers between them.
The dining area defines the shades of the floor and painting.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived with wallpaper with a pattern.
If necessary, the kitchen corner is covered by sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new anti-allergic marble floor has a number of advantages over the previous laminate: a softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted with color is an example of how you can work with space in the pantry.
I left the colors on the architects, I wish it was joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graphic glass cladding with the motif of flowering magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
For a warm, energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, it was possible to store books, among other things, in the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are conveniently controlled from a distance.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast of the new with the older works excellent, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier and with high-quality art objects that Ivana collects throughout her life.
The last one was the kitchen.
The lockers had previously been placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect reduced their number and relocated them.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface softens slightly the pearly surface.
They fit into a small space thanks to the imaginative solution of the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of a small kitchen revived the full-glass cladding of the walls above the worktop.
The unique graphoglass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition to being excellently maintained.
Ivana chose flowers of magnolias, which remind her of the favorite neighborhood she lived in for years.
Now she seems to be happy here, too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bathtub and sink, the new owner chose a neutral shade of the tile.
The large shower has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to create from the given environment a clear simple space in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
We combined the interior materially and colourfully and tried for its elegant, cozy, not too crowded look.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the accessibility of everyday items," adds Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The Supreme Court ruled: “Sometimes you can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as could also be prosecuted for possible crimes he could have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Mark <0xC5><0xA0>najdra and Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>e, on the other hand, he decided that they could not be punished for possible crimes until last November they gave up the exercise of the parliamentary mandate, said the spokesman of the Supreme Court, Petr Knötig.
With this decision, the court rejected the proposal of prosecutor Ivo I<0xC5><0xA1>tvan, who wanted to continue criminal proceedings with MPs.
According to him, they accepted bribes in the form of lucrative positions in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and not making trouble in passing laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these posts can also be prosecuted.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta also arrested an anti-corruption police officer
Bart's lawyer, Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV MPs, also did not want to express too much about the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter too, but due to the protection of classified facts, I can no longer comment on it."
According to the law, the case is handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Corps (GIBS).
The server of tn.cz said that B<0xC3><0xA1>rta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizpravy.cz, the case could be related to the case of the former police president Petr Lessy, whom he allegedly sought to appoint to the post of Bart.
The latest information, however, shows that the detention of V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta is not related to Peter Lessy.
Police President Eva Krop<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>'s spokesman declined to comment on the matter, saying the Prague City Council was dealing with the case.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, said on Friday.
It is there that the applicant supervises the case of B<0xC3><0xA1>rt, and it is therefore indirectly apparent from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are being conducted under a regime of secrecy.
Reporter Novinek managed to catch V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta’s wife Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Klasnova the morning before their residence in Prague’s Kl<0xC3><0xA1>rov.
She was just packing her suitcases in the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole incident.
On Friday morning, Tomio Okamura, leader of the <0xC3><0x9A>svit movement, spoke about Bart’s detention.
According to him, he has no idea what the case is about.
"To see Bart was one of the many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy by Tom Okamura," he added.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, who unsuccessfully ran for the House of Commons in the previous early elections in the Pilsen Region for the Tomi Okamura Direct Democracy Movement, is known for his corruption-causing bribery of MPs for Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongfully sentenced to 18 months with a 30-month deferral.
The verdict was later changed and Bart was acquitted of the charges.
Prospal: I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have the juice, the desire and the enthusiasm
For Prosperal, family was always in the first place, which is why he wants to completely submit to her at the age of 38.
He will either get a job overseas and extend his career, or he will definitely end up with hockey.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for the offer.
Despite the fact that he's a well-known worker who never screws up.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and he can take away his team-mates.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player in Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," he reports resolutely.
The New York Rangers, who have failed to enter the season, and two injured backers, Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan, are reportedly behind him.
What does it look like when you come to the Rangers?
They're just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, it doesn't make any sense to deal with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that's all.
Nowhere has it been said that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it just isn't.
Didn't you hear from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
It is about getting into a situation where the contract really comes about.
When, for example, a player is injured or it does not go to someone and the manchaft does not strike.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get the contract.
But in New York, similar circumstances happen, don't they?
Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan are injured and the team hasn't made it into the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, that chance is always there.
The second thing is that you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got any yet.
This is the reality in which I have to live.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting something to happen?
I have those expectations since July 5th, when the NHL opens up the free-play market, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
Definitely not, I'm going to Tampa for the kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have your program planned?
This is because I am a father and a husband, and from this everything proceeds.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to be a dad and a husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday yours has two hockey games, it's a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go support our children in what they want to do.
You're thinking you could do this in full-time quotes?
Of course, a person can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games because of knee surgery.
And I had so much fun.
One day it'll get to a stage where all the goals, wins and draws won't replace what you've got at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever job you want to have.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could have met besides my family.
You had a lot of deals from Europe: do you have it because you want to play the NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, sporting success comes first – in addition to family.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that is what family life is all about.
My children, I'm sorry, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
And we would be very happy if they continued in this trend.
Because what we're trying to say is, in America, there's a whole lot of possibilities somewhere else.
We should give them that chance.
Are you planning to stay in the United States permanently?
We will practice it as before.
This means that in the summer we will be in <0xC4><0x8C>ech<0xC3><0xA1> na Hlubok<0xC3><0xA1> and in the vicinity of <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
And in winter again in Tampa or wherever our steps will take us.
It's perfect to stay warm.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You can say that I went to meet him, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took me a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey in return offered me a lot of options and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who crave this so they can choose what to do and how to live.
How long will you have the will to work hard, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and the motivation to prove to people that you still have in the NHL, that I am still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna be there.
It can't be planned.
So you can say you're going to wait this season to see how it goes and then decide what to do next?
I'm at a stage where I'm going day by day.
Recently, the CEO of CEZ announced that the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th block of the Temel<0xC3><0xAD>n power plant is postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and agreeing Contracts of difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current leadership of CEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. to a majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give recommendations to shareholders, not hide behind them.
Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I only rule with Saturday.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is beginning to reconcile that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craftsmanship of the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create one.
The President has admitted this in an interview for Law, which will come out tomorrow.
Business and marketing of <0xC5><0xA0>koFIN is led by Abrah<0xC3><0xA1>mek
Its competencies include product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
In office, he replaced Lu<0xC4><0xBC>ka Santoru.
For the past 14 years, Abrahamek has combined his professional career with the automotive sector.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, then at Fiat Czech, where he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo brand and dealers for seven years.
His last job was at Suzuki Motor Czech, where he held the position of manager of the automotive division for more than five years.
<0xC5><0xA0>koFIN was founded in 1992.
Police evacuated part of Los Angeles airport after shooting
The shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport because of this, said to be terminal three.
Reuters, citing California media, claims law enforcement officers shot a gun at an armed man.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, said there was a shooting that injured two to three members of the Transportation Safety Administration.
How many people were injured and whether there are any victims is still not clear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with a greater number of injured.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
With reference to the unnamed agent of the U.S. government, it was announced by CNN television.
The Israeli press has widely reported the explosion at the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack.
A spokesman for the Israeli military declined to comment on the attack, according to CNN.
"We are not commenting on foreign media reports," she said.
The Israeli attack was targeted by missiles and related equipment, according to a U.S. government source, which the Israelis believe could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP quoted another U.S. security official as saying that the target of the Israeli attack on Syrian territory was Russian SA-125 missiles.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was supposedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area, however, according to the DPA, showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they were seen on the batteries of SA-3 missiles, including a command center with radar to monitor the missiles and their targets.
According to Israeli television, the recorded missiles will reach 35 kilometers and could carry 70 kilograms of warheads.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP said.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly declared that it will interfere with any supply of weapons designated by Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual earnings estimate and expects record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual base pre-tax profit to range from $325 million to $340 million, up from $305 million to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current trend is maintained, it will represent a twelve to seventeen percent increase from a record profit of USD 290.4 million in 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an 8% profit in the first half of the year and the second half of the year began with rapid growth mainly in Australian and British non-business travel.
“To date, our 10 countries are profitable and a few are heading for record annual profits before interest and taxation,” he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
Recreation business grew in Australia during the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the recreation area, while business customers spent less.
U.S. trade has recovered after a loss during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to bring in a third year-round profit in a row.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher at $38.20 yesterday.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September for protesting planned oil extraction in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported today by AFP, citing the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
At the same time, it claims that the original accusations of its piracy activists have not yet been withdrawn.
“Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the Arctic oil platform were transferred from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg,” the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA agency, it was a planned relocation.
Ecological authorities first accused them of piracy, for which they faced up to 15 years in prison in case of conviction.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace this accusation with a milder crackdown, which threatens a lower sentence with a maximum of seven years of imprisonment.
Greenpeace said in a statement that the piracy charges had not yet been dropped as promised.
This means that the detainees are now charged with two criminal offences.
A strong committee of inquiry announced last week that piracy charges will be replaced with charges of piracy.
But when 30 inmates stood before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not dropped.
Instead, a new indictment has been filed against everyone," AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at Gazprom’s oil platform in mid-September.
Ecologists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they have appealed, but the court rejected them all.
Ecologists are complaining about prison conditions.
Greenpeace chief executive Kumi Naidoo said the move to St. Petersburg would facilitate meetings with families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse," he warned.
The Dutch King Willem-Alexander was asked by one of the detained activists Faiza Oulahsen.
In a handwritten letter published today by the newspaper Generaleen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He said Maliki played a major role in the resumption of sectarian violence in Iraq, which he said was partly a part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, it will be necessary to study at least one Shakespeare play, a novel from the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include “hidden text” to encourage deeper reading;
Combined English Literature and Language courses will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to have a probationary examination in the language, and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective subject.
The Ministry of Education is expected to release a new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other key topics, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which oversees the graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new stamping system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech last summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was “a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system to regain the trust of society” and that it was necessary to insist that the graduation test be “more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous”.
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics — 116 hours a year or three hours a week — than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
While there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have stated that a comprehensive graduate examination in mathematics — along with a greater emphasis on this subject in the result rankings — is likely to encourage schools to provide additional teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not me
Before the elections, a long-struggling dispute broke out between two wings fighting for influence inside the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
It all culminated in the fact that the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, turned to the court because of the undemocratic composition of the candidates.
The actors of the cause, however, did not want to express too much about it, so that they did not harm the party before the elections even more.
The votes of the voters have now been counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD called on the mayor of Ostrava to step down from the party on Monday evening, and will apparently push for him to lose his post.
But Petr Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What the disputes are about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for Di<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>k.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD certainly expected a much better result.
Did it hurt her that there were disputes within the party in the media before the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better electoral result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is now.
It’s a party that has its own internal problems, it’s internally sick, and people feel that everything isn’t right in it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD?
In my opinion, ODS has been going through bankruptcy for some time and unfortunately, things like this are happening in social democracy now.
It is that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their prebends at the ODS, have moved to the people in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and have an influence on them.
This has to do with the fact that the police walk through the offices of the Ostrava magistrate and collect computers.
This shows that the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not only made up of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But it has been preparing for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was only a foretaste of what is happening now in Prague.
The Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka wing gradually occupied its positions, so that after the elections it could provoke a situation that weakened the Sobotka wing.
A man is in a situation where he sometimes has to make compromises.
Everyone, however, has some internal limits, when they can no longer make those compromises, and that is my case.
Initially, I did not want to run for the House, but when I perceived the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek that I would try to get to the regional candidate so that as the mayor of Ostrava I could strengthen the Sobotkovo wing.
But Hash's wing gave it a hint.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek?
In my opinion, Sl<0xC3><0xA1>vek Sobotka is a person who always talks primarily about the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD program and, to a certain extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I have to admit, I have never heard anything like this from the other side.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is only fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the Party President.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the party's statutes.
In my opinion, with what Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has shown in Prague, he has ended his political career.
As you have noticed, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Ostrava leadership did not approve of you as a candidate.
Political parties are based on competition, which of their members position themselves.
This competition should be largely based on program visions and on the ability of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have the power or vision, but the political party is for them an elevator to money that they would not get anywhere else.
The problem is, when these people start to get to the forefront due to the fact that without scruples they violate the rules, they violate the party’s statutes.
By their practices they make the political parties of the mafia and in my opinion they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To point out this problem is more important to me than to take into account whether any Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
That is why, before the elections, you submitted a proposal to the court for preliminary measures against the appearance of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian region?
The current district executive committee of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by abolishing organizations that do not comply with it, purposefully founding new organizations, gradually expelling uncomfortable party members.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bedna<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then rather canceled the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that demanding compliance with the party’s statutes through the courts is the last option, but when the other methods and control bodies within the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The effort of the leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, led by MEP Adam Rykala, is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruby, Lum<0xC3><0xAD>r Palyza, is behind this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lum<0xC3><0xAD>r Palyza are trying to do everything in their power to get me fired.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then for those votes they consolidate their power in the side.
When I go back to the past, all that happened around the Ban<0xC3><0xAD>k Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Bazala stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could label me as a person who puts money where it doesn’t belong.
The city bought a property that was of great strategic value to it.
How do you continue to do this with your position as mayor?
The district committee already urged me and other people on Monday to consider their stay in the Czechoslovakia.
But I think it's like a thief yelling, "Catch the thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I do not see anyone in the social democracy of Ostrava who would initiate and enforce, sometimes against the members of the party, the creation of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Still, I'm getting uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than to prevent others from getting to the places they want to go.
Will you continue to fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is to function well, then political parties must also function well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to run the state effectively if it can’t even run itself.
So I’m not thinking about leaving the Czechoslovak SSR right now, because I think that it’s not me who’s causing cancer on this side, but these people who are trying to protect me.
Olomouc opens a public ice rink in the historic center
The organizer of Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Sp<0xC3><0xA1>len<0xC3><0xBD> said that the preparatory work on the ice rink was started on October 26 and since Wednesday the ice production unit has been in operation.
The ice sheet is already seven centimeters thick and the area will be ready for first visitors by Friday morning.
The slide has an area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two stands with punch.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the booths and almost the entire area of the podium is roofed so that skaters can comfortably glide," described Burned.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the ice rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on Horn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> due to the repair of Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so that the ice area could return to its original location.
For the first time, people could skate directly in front of the city hall in 2009, when the ice rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice sheet then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which are part of a rich cultural program, will start on the Upper Square one month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>nsk will again be decided by the regional court
The regional court dismissed the charges of twenty-five-year-old Slovak and twenty-two-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men rejected the blame.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court had overturned the district court’s decision and brought the matter back to him for consideration.
The judge refused to comment on the reasons for this, saying that the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the young men assaulted a seventy-seven-year-old man in his house.
The old man died a grieving death.
According to the prosecution, the men chopped him, beat him and kicked him all over his body, and also put about three dozen wounds in his head with a metal object, apparently a gas gun.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull, swelling of the brain or bleeding into the brain, which he succumbed to at the site.
The youngsters allegedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the regional court, they were the only indirect evidence against the accused odor traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established in the sense of the legal instructions.
Although the odour traces from the scene of the crime and in other cases coincided with the defendants in more than ten cases, the police initially treated them as tangible rather than odour traces.
In addition, some errors were found in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants has not been unquestionably proven.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a shattered head was found by relatives who thought he had fallen and injured himself.
Not even a doctor called by the rescue service was alerted to the violent death.
Only a few days later, the forensic experts contacted the doctors who found signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the traces from the crime scene that the relatives cleaned up.
No DNA of the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slov<0xC3><0xA1>k lived in Hungary.
He is now serving an 8.5-year sentence, which was duly confirmed by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men, who are accused of robbing the gold industry.
The robbery took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slapn<0xC3><0xBD>.
The youngest of the accused in the murder of a senior lives in Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
He was released from custody by the court in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by construction workers who will reconstruct the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living Legend Wayne Shorter Closes Up for Autumn Strings Week
Saxophone giant and jazz legend Wayne Shorter will make a point next Wednesday after the 18th anniversary of the Strings of Autumn festival.
Shorter will perform at the Grand Hall of Lucerne on November 6 with his quartet Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening he joins Shorter with the spontaneous jazz improvisation PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kum<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xA1>k.
In Shorter's adaptations for the symphony orchestra, Pegasus is heard from the new album Without A Net, as well as his earlier compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert on Struny Autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he has worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he also met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitou<0xC5><0xA1> and the Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade they set the direction of a new style of fusion.
He has been with the Wayne Shorter Quartet for the past 13 years.
After the festival, there will be a club night of Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triana, the local audience will be introduced to the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Damkovi says UEFA has banned the publication of penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damkova, chairwoman of the arbitration committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing penalties for judges.
She is banned by UEFA's rules, she said in an interview with the daily Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
Otherwise, they would be threatened with a penalty.
Damkova also refused to let the Pilsen footballers know where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of the vote, I can lose 1:6," Damkova said in response to criticism, which was outraged after Plze<0xC5><0x88> played twice as many penalties as other league teams in recent times.
Although FA<0xC4><0x8C>R has stopped publishing penalties for referees in recent months, Damkova assures that the judges complain about their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the commission finds that the referee has made a mistake, it will restrict his delegation, whatever the game may be," Damkova said.
The reason why the penalties are not disclosed, according to Damka, is a ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and severely punishes infringements."
"We are very suspicious and we look for something behind every mistake."
"We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we don't stop doing this, there will be tough sanctions," Damkova said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the publication of the information continues, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of the arbitrators.
"And they're very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to complete the program for the training of arbitrators," Damkova added.
The arrest of Barta is related to Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and Bém: Is it behind the eavesdropping?
V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, the president of public affairs, was arrested by police on Thursday.
Along with him, Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek, head of the department of analytics and computer science of the anti-corruption police, was arrested.
The arrest is related to interrogations of lobbyist Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the e-mails received by the server Novinky.cz has been confirmed by a reliable source to the Czech Press Office.
The interrogated phone calls of Janousko and Bém, published in March by the newspaper Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta Dnes and in which the two men refer to each other as "Maz<0xC3><0xA1>nka" and "Kolib<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k", show Janousko's influence on the city's steps under Bém's leadership.
The newspaper then reported that it was acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later they escaped to the security agency ABL.
This was where Bart owned it.
The server Novinky.cz pointed out that the arrested criminal Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek worked for the BIS just before he joined the anti-corruption police.
Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek moved to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the interrogations, at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I can neither confirm nor say anything at all," Michal Muravsk<0xC3><0xBD>, a prosecutor at the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, said.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code.
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the coming into force of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act from 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the company representatives surveyed said that issues related to the two key codes in their company had not been addressed at all.
This is the result of a survey by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which investigated the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the approaching expiration date of the two key codes, it is only now at the last moment that a number of managers are beginning to realize the significant impact they can have on the business of their companies.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Due to the lavishness of politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually take place.
"But now they have only a few weeks to make the transition to a new law for their companies without complications," Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal partner Jan Spa<0xC4><0x8D>il commented on the results.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively engaged in the new laws, 26 percent said their companies have already taken all necessary measures to be prepared in time.
In addition, 35 percent of these companies are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
In contrast, one in five companies has not yet dealt with recodifications, yet they have a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only 8% of companies admit that issues related to recodifications have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts (21%) for the largest number of companies surveyed, followed by the settlement of business conditions (16%) and further changes in the real estate cadastral register and liability for damages (10%).
One of the most important novelties of the whole recodification of contracts is the unification of the treaty regulation only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, as a result of which contract law should become more transparent for both citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new arrangement will offer many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom of arrangement of relations," said lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Subtan<0xC3><0xBD>.
In the context of the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
Then there are the topics related to changes in the convening and running of the general meeting (15%) and representation of the company (14%).
The new legislation entails tightening obligations and possible impacts on statutory bodies, especially in situations where companies are at risk of insolvency or insolvency.
"In practice, this means that if board members and company executives do not act with the care of the proper economy and do not avert the imminent bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit obtained for the performance of the function only in the last two years," he added.
Pierre Rainero: I’m trying to make Cartier’s style evolve like a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things, so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains Pierre Rainero, Director of Style at Cartier, in an interview for HN.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
Travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in West Africa; only one in 5,000.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for the 2013 CNN Hero of the Year award.
In the 2013 CNN Hero of the Year contest, you can vote for him or any of the top ten candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwell has watched his father fall unconscious again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the Cameroonian capital Yaounde in 1981.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain and there created a hematoma that caused him problems throughout his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwell spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwell said.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since the death of Bwell's father in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 population.
And even if doctors could visit Cameroonians, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health care spending in this country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
When Bwell saw his father and many of his countrymen suffering, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwell and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on the weekends, where they provide medical care for free.
Since 2008, he has helped nearly 32,000 people with his group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people rush into supplies, attach medical supplies to rooftops, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
It is not always accompanied by happiness.
Sometimes vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as true heroes: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a reason to celebrate, and Bwell – with his broad smile and unbridled energy – is very willing to engage in local fun.
The next day, the team begins to treat hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients on each trip,” says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a 60-kilometer radius, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get bells or gifted glasses or a birth certificate for free – a document that the school requires but that many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in the school building, in the city hall or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to free up space for another patient.
With the help of light from the generator, operating room and hygienic equipment, Bwell and his volunteers work until early in the morning.
It’s exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
“To stay up and keep working, they’re playing drums all night,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian physicians and international medical students – performed 700 free surgeries last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to locals.
One man said that after the operation the hernia will be able to work again.
"That will change our family's future," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says that this second work finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
“I’m not sure when he’s actually sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who has been studying medicine for the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia and is working as a volunteer for the Bwelle group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to get money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it’s a great practice they wouldn’t get at home.
“We thoroughly washed Dr. Bwell’s hands and removed blood stains or held his instruments,” says O’Malley.
As a medical student in your second year in America, you will never experience this.
Student volunteers usually pay for their trip to Cameroon on their own and often arrive with donated medical needs.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation and study.
"He's definitely a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, constant denial is not a burden.
Helping others live happier, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy to be doing this job,” Bwelle says.
And I mean my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Laughing at people, alleviating their pain – that’s why I do it.

Minister Holc<0xC3><0xA1>t reinstated the position of Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I believe it is essential that this function is clearly defined and formalized, so that nurses have a representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holc<0xC3><0xA1>t, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves due attention from the Ministry.
In the performance of this profession, it is necessary not only high professionalism, but also human approach and personal conviction.
"I will be happy and with all responsibility to try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who, by their approach to patients, do not help us too much to carry out their vocations with all their empathy and help us to improve the image of the nurses in the eyes of the public," says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>, on the occasion of her appointment to the position, also stated that she wants to deal with various aspects of the nursing position and intends, among other things, to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, educators, other doctors and non-medical volunteers.
"I don't want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, each with their own competencies, and together with other health professionals, they form a dedicated work team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself face a number of problems that arise in the performance of the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solutions."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and health documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks burden the nurse unnecessarily and take her time that she could and should rather devote to patients," says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Other areas it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve mutual cooperation in the team and with the managements of health service providers, adjusting competencies and also labour law issues, such as observance of the labour code or non-employment of nurses in their place.
We often hear anonymous grievances, but for fear of possible harm, they are not documented in a specific case where there may be a violation of the rules.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, and so the function of the Chief Nurse of the Czech Republic could serve in this case as a guarantee of maintaining the anonymity of such a complaint and have the specific case examined by the competent authorities," concludes Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1> graduated from the Secondary School of Health in the field of Nursing (she graduated in 1978) and from the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogics (she graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been acting as Head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical fields and Recognition of Qualifications in the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bedside in the internal department, and also worked as a teacher at the Secondary School of Health, where she was also a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she worked as the main nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, and was engaged in lecture activities in the field of nursing.
He is not a member of any political party.
So that I don't get entangled in hate
The writer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, V<0xC3><0x81>CLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, darkness, presence.
The number of pages comparable to his best-known work House (Petrov, 2001) indicates that this is not a subtle volume.
Another prominent contemporary Czech writer, Emil Hakl, testified for Salon Kahudu.
What happened to the fact that you wrote a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - so as not to intoxicate myself with hatred.
To see around him new and new clones of human foolishness, young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavor.
I’m not talking about us old men, faces ruined by powerless lust, weasel souls, and vice versa overflowing ideologues who try to sell their “product” with the expression of a small whore on the market.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, weirdos and hidden entities.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel like my brain burns out of life on this planet.
I like to go for a walk and then read a book at the lighthouse in the evening.
You're talking about a sense of despair, of hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old, like all of us?
The fracture occurred a long time ago, at about ten years old.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, I lived after that.
But there's still a surprised, quiet boy in there somewhere.
I see other lonesome practitioners, each in their own tornado of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I am taking part in this huge, thousand-year-long movement of the life system on this planet - the birth of an unfathomable future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are the players of a sad and beautiful game where, through trial and error, another generation of beings emerges, creating some superhuman, artificial intelligence in trillions of interactions per second.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather, dialogue, which is conducted by the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats to the level and forms into a book.
Just as a period of peace is imbued with silently sleeping metastases of wars that may one day awaken – so my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I felt the avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I didn't do anything, it would one day quietly engulf me.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and placed in layers that are stored in the dark "below the level of consciousness".
The neocortex, a gray brain bark, asks the older evolutionary entities, goes to the ancient aerials of the brain tree.
He speaks to furry beasts, asks snakes, seeks answers in the flight of birds, lifts his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person in question has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, registers of memory, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is exposed to an ever-changing presence, in an unceasing effort to name and understand its surroundings and to decode its contents.
Sometimes there are problems with overloading.
Analogously - as if you "fall" PC, from the program of the language emulator and the translator from foreign languages you would get involved first in the operating environment, for example Windows, and after a few unsuccessful reboots ended up with a dark green shimmering screen Bios, in the process of the basic and the operating system, which runs on the interface.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about, I am talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why are you interested in this type of regression on a regular basis?
Because it's a pit.
In the ups and downs of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling, and behavior - a gap will appear.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He looked so long into the abyss that the abyss looked into him."
Pure feeling - that a person is lost if all hope disappears, mentally "dies" and a new quality comes.
And why do I care personally?
I'll answer with a parable.
Once one fell into a tune and drowned, days, months and years went by, he was still drowning and reading, and those books taught him to swim—that is, to live.
He became a "diver."
I hope some of the sentences I've written will help someone, as the Count's texts once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, of the specific person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but in my opinion it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the word-and-phrase process."
From an early age he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine of Captain Nem, ran along the St<0xC3><0xAD>nadles in dark alleys.
At the same time, behind all the branches of the authors and their message, it reads: "The sun shines brightly on the worlds of others Karl Hynek Macha".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
On the feedback that comes to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe years later, they contact me on the street by chance and thank me for helping them with my book in some difficult life decision.
Books are, in fact, "lifes" or, better said, "worlds."
They are encoded in characters of letters, they carry experience, the history of the regions of which language.
We can bring them to life whenever we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It is actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to the old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the publication of the book, you - as it happens - await a chain of author's readings.
I remember you used to love reading.
Are you happy to do it again, or do you feel differently after years?
I'd rather just tell you today.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic sign - they are inconspicuous, they do not notice each other too much, they have friendly radiance, you do not feel lonely with them.
Let me give an example - in the small town of <0xC4><0x8C>erven<0xC3><0xBD> Kostelec there was (and I hope he is still alive) a curly bookkeeper (according to his name <0xC4><0x8C>ervenka), a cheerful companion and a good girl bull.
During one drink, he introduced me to the individual articles of the readers of my book House.
I looked into their eyes and then I was shown a fragmented, read copy of my book.
In embarrassment, I laid down the just readout of the morning meal and cried briefly in a manly manner.
We all stood there quietly, swaying and weeping drunkenly with milking.
Then the young blond mixer couldn't stand it, and with a scream he jumped out of the window and into the snow.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran into the night landscape, and were swarming with the happy rage of the sensitivities, the aching souls of the countrymen, and the pangs of the fallen patriots - they roared and roared like werewolves until the morning.
Each of your books is formally and in terms of content different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, darkness, presence?
It's a story.
It is a fairy tale about one country behind the Devatero Rivers and the Devatero Mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts into the mouth of a folk healer the words of an old Russian fairy tale: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog on it, a gray coffin.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we used to be devils in hell a long time ago and draw - what role we're going to play in this country.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it to the free flow of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal – Otokar B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unspeakable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depth and in such breadth that it completely transcends our horizons - and so, with absolute certainty, we act precisely in the intent of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded by the influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die while defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes there is a disturbance and we exude sympathy.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disturbances, standing on the shore of an ocean of unconsciousness, and catching the tides of wet wind in a piercing sail made of a dirty handkerchief.
I have to write in order to be human.
Obama resigns from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama resigned yesterday from his often-repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
With reference to hundreds of thousands of announcements of testimonies from providers, Republicans have accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama broke his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In light of what he called the “media outcry” about the announcements, Obama urged Americans who received the announcements to look for new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
Its administration argues that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance on their own may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
“I’m telling these Americans on the same level: you deserve something better,” Sebelius said in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the internet market had been "poor" since October.
“I’m disappointed and angry like everyone else,” she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
Sebelius, irritated by this sentence, captured by the microphone on, spoke yesterday to the counsellor sitting behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which was held after a turbulent exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, a representative from the Missouri program, who was also concerned with the matter.
For more than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly raised the question of why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily surrender to the government of sponsored insurance, and did not buy the program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed the talks and according to various sources from agencies and behind the scenes, they are already hand in hand.
The transaction is expected to be announced in November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for LTE networks, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner’s competitor Karel Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rek owns the KKCG Group.
Under the brand name Sazka Telecommunications, it launched a frequency auction for LTE networks.
And to everyone's surprise, until then, there was no talk about the company's desire to penetrate telecommunications.
But Sazku is now led by the very experienced telecoms maz<0xC3><0xA1>k Robert Chv<0xC3><0xA1>tal.
He started as head of marketing at Radiomobile (now T-Mobile), later became director of Slovak T-Mobile and lastly headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The dealer plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now admitted that she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If he succeeds in the auction, he will be able to move existing customers from his own virtual operator to his network.
Under normal circumstances, Vodafone would probably not like this, but according to the Economic Newspapers, it could be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from the agreement of rival operators O2 and T-Mobile, which will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in tendering on the LTE network (as a newcomer can auction a specially designed spectrum), then Vodafone may not enter the auction at all, or he will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone will launch Sazka into its 2G/3G network (respectively the newly built 900 MHz LTE network), allowing the company to quickly start the network.
In the meantime, Vodafone will start building a costly LTE network that Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The savings could then be spent by Vodafone on a fixed-line internet or cable TV provider.
And Kellner?
The purchase of Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is a Czech subsidiary) immediately acquired a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it is a large moloch that will be awaiting restructuring.
At the auction, the LTE network would have won Kellner already for O2 and most likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already announced that they will be sharing networks.
The auction could finally be a success, but probably not with the high sums that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rk.
Or two titans of the Czech business against the global giants.
Will Czech Television ever be able to do without signing events?
In the era of President Zeman, she entered the legendary ashtray scene, and so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that gathers evidence of harassment of the castle estate.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k has not been documented in this way, let alone signed under it.
True, the editors stopped.
The described cases, however, do not answer the question of where such a propensity of some journalists to the Zemanites comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or, not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of inappropriate empathy.
And if we assume a general impermanence, we cannot forgive the question of whether other, no less unscrupulous, power interests, which have not yet had an opportunity, are striving to change the conditions on television.
It is true that in the developed countries there are no attempts by politicians to intervene in broadcasting.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there are no complaints about the public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mainly what they consider to be the tendency that is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we have not yet reached this stage of civilization and this situation is not with us.
But perhaps in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more convenient than more complicated descriptions of a vague situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings strikes at each other.
JAN JANDOUREK: The Curse of This Country: Presidents on the Edge of Power
It is almost a rule that in the key moments of the country, the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill his state obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have experienced the end of his presidency and events around Munich would have been a little different.
We probably would not have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could have flown over the border, heavy weapons could have been destroyed, and the government could have fled to London immediately and not fought hard there for its legitimacy.
And most of all, the nation would not have a caterpillar from that capitulation to this day.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> was not a statesman and was still fit for Munich, but during the war it began to go with him from the hill and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
Being a little better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coups.
It's a pity to talk about H<0xC3><0xA1>ch.
They elected him by saying that "Mr. President will not get into a situation that he will decide".
But he had to, even if the big decision with a knife on his neck was probably not at Hitler's chancellery.
Until the last days of March 1939, the Chief of Intelligence, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Moravec, said what should be done to ensure that the occupation, which he knew exactly for the day, did not happen to the Germans so smoothly and with such a profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, on the one hand, they did not believe him, on the other, they were afraid.
Gottwald's human debris had his aged comrades executed, as Moscow had ordered him.
Ludv<0xC3><0xAD>k Svoboda was definitely unable to participate in normalization and had to be put down, already completely senile.
That Hus<0xC3><0xA1>k was helpless and a sickly depressive old man facilitated the events of November 89, but that's the only downside.
Havel was lucky not to have met him in office in recent years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis retiree, but many of his actions suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, here we have this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces look what they look like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is now no external threat to the republic.
Or maybe it's a threat, but it's not seen that way.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally not (from a historical point of view) good that the president is not completely in power.
But this is not the normal state.
Couldn’t we once again elect in this country someone who is acceptablely thinking and acceptablely healthy?
Remote planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasizing about extraterrestrial life on Earth aren’t topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw at you.
In the concept of his quartet, which on November 6 in the large hall of the Prague Lucerne will conclude this year's festival Strings of Autumn, because everything is related to everything.
The score of the jazz saxophone quartet Wayne Shorter is the current feelings of the musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as completely improvised chamber music and think not of harmony or rhythm, but of film.
This principle, however, the freshly eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, the bearer of nine Grammys, former co-player Miles Davis and probably the greatest living jazz saxophonist today - does not like to explain.
He does not talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
When I was eighty, I came to the conclusion that it was best to let life surprise me.
“Too many people plan everything, and then they’re disappointed when things change,” Shorter says.
How the Insects of Thailand Raised the Sales of the Paris Bar
You may grumble over an insect and have no idea that you are consuming about half a kilogram of it a year completely voluntarily.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are definitely trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you also have taken care of a unique experience.
He was the first person in Paris to list the insects on the menu of his company in early October by Elie Daviron, chef and owner of Le Festin Nu.
The bar, for which the name was inspired by William Burroughs’ book Naked Lunch, is located in the fashionable 18th arrondissement near Montmartre, which is heavily visited by tourists.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, guests can taste not only different larvae, moths or water bugs, but also squirrels.
Carefully and specially packaged supplies (so that insects do not damage their wings, curl their legs or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is only learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pioneering menu immediately lists several reasons why to consume insects.
The first of these is the ecological benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, it makes the right restaurant pleasure, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just conveying a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be fascinated by the idea of eating a bug decorated with pests, but the reaction of the customers of the Paris bar to the served insects is very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics say they will eventually taste it, even if they start with the smallest bites and only eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
The President of the Union of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Maty<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>: The new green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been faced with a continuous decrease in the volume of contracts and the lack of interest of the state to solve the problem of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Program was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measures, will save considerable amounts for heating, but also for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 new jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the state, leverage and multiplication effects are significant, it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
Therefore, the Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic fundamentally disagrees with the government’s resolution and calls for the implementation of such steps that would allow further continuation of the program, so that further challenges could be announced within its framework.
LAW, 1 November 2013
The dog snatched the carpet, the president buried it and ended up on the sledgehammer
On Thursday, President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman left the motel hospital in Prague, where he spent the night on his bed, and went to the castle in L<0xC3><0xA1>ny.
What kind of health condition is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said U.S. espionage “has gone too far”
John Kerry hinted at a softening of the U.S. defense stance on its surveillance programs and, in an unprecedented confession, said that in some cases, espionage “has gone too far.”
The foreign minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as “autopilots” in light of the sleazy revelations about the NSA’s espionage activities, which emerged thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The leaked information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry said via video link at an open government conference in London: “There is no doubt that the President and I and the rest of the government really learned about some of the things that were going on with perseverance because there was that possibility, with reference to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War and the Cold War itself.”
He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the border, but emphasized that it had not violated anyone’s rights.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify it to the people and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA is striving for good and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to fire themselves.”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is determined to murder and blow people up and attack governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happened?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are going to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad about alleged U.S. espionage, and convinced Europeans that it is necessary to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and other people this week and that he was concerned about their threat to stop participating in counterterrorism organizations because they were disappointed by the National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance.
“For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe stays with us on the same ship, given the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism,” Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview with Washington.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism despite their anger at the NSA programs.
Reports in the media that the NSA had collected millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some US allies, despite the agency's head saying this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Another revelation cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA was tracking the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the Allies' espionage as necessary and said it was a common issue on both sides.
In the midst of the turmoil, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary trip that should take place this year, and hopes that members of both parties and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to participate will be published.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said the trip's goal was to help repair the relationship, he added that "well-meaning educational measures" would also be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to spying programs that they have been using for years.
“While we’re tweaking our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to realize that we’re not the only ones doing spying here,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is heading to the Middle East and Poland as planned this weekend to respond to the hostility already induced by the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activity.
Australian woman appeals against stay in Thai prison
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island when she falsely claimed to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally indicted on June 15 by a provincial court on a false charge on Phuket Island when Thai police said the taxi driver, along with two other men who allegedly detained her, assaulted her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, a recording from the industrial television later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Police on Phuket Island had been interviewing Bamford for two days before finding out she had invented the incident.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket instead of being placed in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who in the case of his daughter asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Obviously it's a difficult time, but we hope he'll come back to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail for 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia say she has been on holiday in the Krabi resort area of southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she has received a warning that the appeal could lead to a lawsuit that would increase her sentence and result in her being placed in prison for adults.
However, after the recent murder of an Australian travel agent, Michelle Smith, in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to fix a shattered image for tourists, which may have been behind a liberating verdict.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr joked: Goal of the breeches?
In the defensive zone, he got a puck and no one caught him anymore.
In addition, the leak turned into a quick forhend call.
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, then on Thursday night the 119th NHL winning goal was commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, the director of Czech Railways, Petru Svobod, contacted my agent and asked him if I would not be interested in advertising their most modern train Pendolino!" he wrote at the beginning with an exaggeration.
They say we're a lot like each other.
I’m going to have to finish my night training so I don’t have to speed up.
"I'm afraid the Minister of Defense might come back and want to advertise the jets!" he added.
New Jersey also won the second consecutive victory in a row.
"And most importantly, you've noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrova is working," concluded J<0xC3><0xA1>gr.
Place of filling candle filling gul<0xC3><0xA1>s
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a bunch of losers.
It is not only the parties that did not even enter the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD because of their internal split.
Politicians instead of Christmas candles served us a post-election goulash on the weekend.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s movement, which promised voters to change the political style of government.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party is being recorded politically because of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the House of Representatives.
The president has lost a strategic lead over other politicians due to the unfortunate event, but there are still a few ways to get it back - for example, by selecting a future prime minister.
While the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is moving away from the chances of getting a prime minister’s seat in my eyes, entrepreneur Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is getting closer.
The electoral development is still miles away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the election scenario of the left-wing <0xC4><0x8C>SSD government supported by the Communists, this development is a better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore also the economy.
Due to the vocal resistance of ANO to get together with ODS or TOP 09, the most likely variant of the coalition is still <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ANO and KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL (a total of 111 MPs).
Given the split in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak partner in the negotiations, the result of the coalition negotiations can be quite disappointing for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The minority government of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD composed of "non-Jemenites" at the Castle will probably not pass.
Moreover, any government in which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we not running for another early election by default?"
The next election would be a referendum on the strength of the YES electoral mandate.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s plans to introduce sector taxes, increase income taxes more significantly or build a state bank have, hopefully, fallen below the table.
The parties of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, YES, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL and <0xC3><0x9A>svit, on the other hand, agree, for example, on the promotion of business, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the promotion of employment of disadvantaged persons, on the reduction of the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
Tension areas occur most often in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
But YES now has the upper hand, so the program of the most likely coalition YES, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL would lean rather to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better outcome than a left-wing program with a tax on everything that is still moving in the economy.
