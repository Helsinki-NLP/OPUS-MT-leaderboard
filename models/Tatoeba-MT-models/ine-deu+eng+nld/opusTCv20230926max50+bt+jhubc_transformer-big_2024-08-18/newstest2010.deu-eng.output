Barack Obama is the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a check of over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he pays a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October out of 172 people and 33 organizations.
The pair then met with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit culminates with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the Prestige Award.
He is the fourth president of the United States, but only the third to receive the award directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when taking the prize.
The president does not want to evade this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He intensified the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, the diploma and the cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme then includes a banquet with the President and his wife, which will include the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests, apart from the King and Queen of Norway.
Obama was very cautious about the price from the beginning.
For example, he suggested that he felt that he did not fully deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that the price is not only for him, but for all who aspire to the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he said that for him this was a "call to action".
Nature Protectors Accused of Extortion
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases last year, he filed appeals against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said theLeitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in prison and faces a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian towns you can find the sorting bins again.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage cans.
I do not want to claim that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that even if we are the second-largest city in the Republic, the councillors are not taking adequate care of this problem.
Brno is in the waste race in the Urwaldliga, not only because we, as citizens, are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers here, but above all because of the number of tons of waste for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the mooring place opposite the Affected Goose.
Mr Onderka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but that seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also not a honey sniff in other parts.
Many of my friends don’t want to sort the waste.
Out of laziness.
They are too far away from the trash cans.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles after the party.
But on Konicova street, I did not see tons of paint in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when driving the tram.
The rubbish almost went over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, right?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
You would rather buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic, instead of buying a few more tons of garbage and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance even with official statistics after I searched the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst place in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and health care
After the left-wing party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sick pay and construction savings.
But not for public debt interest or for international litigation.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for the sensitive expenses, pensions or for the sick pay. "This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, miners," says Janota.
The loans are always paid higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where to take, the treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state business are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
In order for the pensions or health care funds, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people do not have to be afraid, they get this money.
But for the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase more and more rapidly and along with it the costs and interest.
The state will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be enough to raise the VAT only slightly or cut the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Due to the money laundering in favor of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing for the expansion of highways and railways next year.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly made cheaper.
Mostly get, which is also not free.
This means delay or closure of thirty large buildings, the creation of Europe's money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the outflow of money Solomonic – it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, in which the state owns the majority, and from these the money is then distributed to the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never secure and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ had a budget of $18 billion.
The dividends are used to pay the environmental damage liquidation, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to EU rules, the actual budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP.
But the carnival of the upheavals is not over yet.
Nearly three billion were cut in the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for litigation, even for building savings.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court case, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already started two billion project "Cash of State", which is supposed to allow to monitor on-line, for which the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister could not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your Next Smartphone Will Master Two Operating Systems
Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans put forward look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and Windows Mobile will switch Android in a matter of seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, said Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware already successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM on which the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now, VMware is working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to arrive to the customer within 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains torments hotel owners
Scneeless slopes do not only worry the Giant Mountains residents.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas party will be on snow or "on muddy ground", said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
If you want the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas, should not hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer saving and in which the quality of the stay comes only in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Day.
I think they will try to sell these for a while, but then they also have to give up, and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, appreciated Jandura.
The Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some more affordable Christmas stays for the last moment, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
New Year’s Eve in the Giant Mountains can also be offered by the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are less free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if it snows.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, it manages to occupy the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and at Christmas we only have a few rooms left.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec-Hotel, Karel Rada.
Hotel Omnia is also 80 percent occupied for New Year’s Eve stays at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, half of the beds remain free.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A little weaker is now February, but the moment when the snow comes, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains is certainly increasing, said the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a bigger snowfall.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rain, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that there will be another warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It’s almost strange with what student zeal Barack Obama, the president with his reputation for being the smartest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy on the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off on the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Way Forward", without hesitation.
Three years ago, he criticized the Bush idea - sending fresh troop contingents into the Iraq plagued by civil war - as "irresponsible and, in its aftermath, catastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and, to the extent, very successful, that the news about Iraq today is no longer spoken of at all.
Bush’s reputation was not improved by this, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting position than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
The military again asked him to increase the troop contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of Operation Afghanistan, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordination habits, strongly criticized the indignant gunmen in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he deceived the general with 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
What is most problematic about the entire Obama strategy is that he intends to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process in three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can be trusted and no agreements are made.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if formally established correctly, remain only pseudo-buildings behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the unpredictability of the conditions that further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
The creation of a “capable state”, which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the little soldiers who broke out in the war cry about the "early return" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that can not be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the timing of the withdrawal is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept it as an indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is declining.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindukusch Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the tightened sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the question for the United States is whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question has to be answered in the period when America is stepping up to win the withdrawal from Afghanistan after Obama.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years until the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time for him to move on to another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
The managers of Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive bonuses in cash
The executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which thus responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be taken from the managers in the event that they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street premium bonds with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction it has to go, said former JPMorgan banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after it set aside nearly $17 billion in premium bonds for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the beginning of the financial crisis.
The UK said on Wednesday it intends to impose a one-off 50 percent tax on bankers’ bonuses that exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Five record-breaking women have won this year’s Nobel Prize in Literature and Literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf in Stockholm.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her compatriot Jack Szostak, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
Israeli chemist Ada Jonath, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, won the prize for enlightenment of the ribosome structure and function.
The last recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for their analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
This award was presented today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of fiberglass and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these prize winners has received the diploma, Nobel medals and certificate of the acquisition of the prize money.
It amounts to ten million Swedish kronor in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the prize money will be divided among them.
According to tradition, the American president, Barak Obama, has received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversies of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path, and beyond that he is at the top of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policies, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the achievement of world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about staying in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps also the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the government deficit is too high, which also further deepens the crisis of public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday.
According to the budget law, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should save with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, in Parliament on Wednesday, the left-wing proposals for money circulation were voted on and the money for the salaries of state officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers was increased.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy to cover up the budget deficit.
The left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, have therefore created a sharp domestic dispute, which is why the question mark arises about the further work of the Fisherman’s Cabinet, on whose design the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as approved by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures imposed by the fisheries government in the autumn, and that according to their understanding, it is intended to end the national debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, explained today during a breakfast discussion with the entrepreneurs that the politicians have neglected the "serious problem" that represents the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution anymore.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, said the budget is gruesome and the government should weigh its continued existence.
The ODS Deputy Chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial board as "strong utterances".
The head of the CSSD, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to the Topolanek words that the state deficit was gruesome, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also pleased.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unsuccessful" shows the world a lot of the country's struggles and victories despite some criticism that the lead role was played by an American actor.
The story is about sport, race and about Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is represented in his life story by the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-nine-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon will play another important role.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing section "Million Dollar Baby", already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which in the end he became a slaveholder, a fictional U.S. president, but is still as important to many as Levan, and also to God in "Allman".
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unconquered", and at the same time is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how he spoke
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to reconcile the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people remain divided racially and economically even after apartheid.
He believes that he can get his people through the sport, so he decides to get the rugby players who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rose to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I noticed when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it’s being transmitted, and I felt like I knew what you were feeling, he said.
It’s important for me to become a different person.
Matt Damon in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that it was opening and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, ‘In the movie I look much bigger.’
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unconquered" and there is also talk of the prospect of an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his analysis in the following words: "This was a very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the websites rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of light about Norway solved: the Russians have tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry has only yesterday admitted that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was again unsuccessful and the rocket, designated as the type "bulava", which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become a nightmare of the Russian generality and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence on site during the missile tests had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers it is already written about "bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly, but glows
The 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight, technical damage to the rocket occurred again.
Presumably the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which ran under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over northern roads was actually the damaged "bulava".
In addition, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian missile.
This time, the generality has refrained from this, claiming that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage were immediately damaged.
Even if no test start was made without errors, the leadership of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "bulava" will fly once without problems and will carry up to ten hypersonic atomic warheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vyaceslav Fetisov once again presents himself in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder is helping his team CSKA Moscow out in need, and is probably already in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some of the remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
It is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will affect only one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, said fellow player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey game, according to AP.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, scoring 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world titles and he has also triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also earned success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup in the Detroit dress.
He has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai has surrendered to the unions. All overtime is canceled
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the abolition of all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the unions about a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, that is why on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two layers of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive it in retrospect for the Saturday shift of November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
Taking into account that overtime was the most urgent and burning point with regard to the demands and complaints of the unions that had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for two more overtime hours.
As soon as the agreement is signed, the unions will withdraw their willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the unions are expected to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfilment of the demands and sign a joint document, they would be ready to lift the readiness to strike.
The situation in the automobile factory sharpened last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously struck because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
On the other hand, the management felt that the employees had to do the overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
The unions also demanded in their Monday strike call that employees who had stopped production last Wednesday should not be sanctioned.
In the area of overtime, the unions are calling for overtime work to be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they demand to pay the fee of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Series production started at the company in November last year.
As of September this year, approximately 80,000 vehicles have been manufactured here, with the current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ‘stealed’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact predominates against the disadvantage that the compound does not act as strongly on common virus variants as one of the already existing drugs.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured yet.
However, the composition of the drug can prolong the life of the patient and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus multiplication has also resulted in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which no more drugs are effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical and Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg paves the way for dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances called metallocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metallocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block viral propagation in ways other than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come up with new ‘improved’ compounds, which have been prepared based on knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
The metallocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and persistent virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus cleavage caused by the HIV protease, no mature viral particles would be produced.
If we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the virus’s propagation in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in the press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper, published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed further.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the test tube, including against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarboranes on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the drugs used clinically, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes the metallocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Institute of Biochemistry of the Institute for Organic Chemistry of the Institute of Structural Biology.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to fisherman who resists
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "gray-full" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its continued existence.
The ODS's statement called the prime minister "strong statements".
There is supposed to be time for analysis.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Necas said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the Left in Parliament.
The approach of the SDGs and the Social Democrats to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament on Wednesday approved the 2010 budget, however, with proposals for link-party amendments amounting to more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for public officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy to cover up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should save with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has complied with the wish of the government, because the amended budget is also only a less bad variant of the provisional budget.
Disappointment and meaninglessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of meaninglessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has said that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation in the event that the amendments would be accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota signed up with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government deal.
He has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the handling of the budget.
To what extent Fischer is in favour of the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do in the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if parliament continues to pass deficit-increasing laws, such as those concerning sick pay and pensions or the service law Novelle.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by the ODS were not wrong
This is a matter for the Prime Minister and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in deputy function who profess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to renounce the fight against the high deficit of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the leftist majority that is currently in Parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens’ democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that will be up to date, then I will deal with it, said the Minister of Defense Martin Bartak, nominated by the Citizen Democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the European Council in the afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday if the prime minister explicitly asked the MPs of the Citizen Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not think of ourselves as orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize my voice was missing.
Even when I resigned from the mandate, I knew that in the coming months everything would be positive, especially about the Bolshevikization of the parliament and destruction, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will run for about the same price.
The Czech Railway will terminate or restrict some less-exploited express and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two per cent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares incl. basic and customer fare will not change.
For example, the residents of the Ostrava area have several connections to the capital, and the railway uses Pendolino-type trains for this route.
The high-speed train will no longer run to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less express trains will also run on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The biggest reduction is planned for the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route will also be cancelled and the operation of some high-speed trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced on a few days a week.
Among the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to move to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth transport route of the suburban transport system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at a time interval of two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava since December 13.
This year’s regional railway bill: an increase of 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, in total the railway receives four billion crowns in order to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, just like this year. The local trains provide the districts, in total they pay for it in three milli in the next year.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains and the express trains, the railway has a new ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps that is why they have not taken up the price increase with the vast majority of tickets.
Changes are only made to one-day net tickets CD Net and to cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net will be increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the plug driven, until now it was uniform for travel between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Filipino militants arrested more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitants kidnapped 75 people today in the south of the Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially only informed about 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 militants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield during the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to extradite the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police were tracking the kidnappers because of the violence that called for revenge actions between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was linked to the election to the governor’s office, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, however, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will appear in the American cinemas "Invictus: The Unconquered", which covers part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was supposedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African rugby champion, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the film’s film launch, reactions from critics as well as the public become loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize and in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it arrives in cinemas at a time when, on the one hand, preparations for the World Cup culminate in South Africa, but at the same time the media shock the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants on the part of the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations against the casting of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film in his own words.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela several times in person, so that I can - as they say - receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the film's premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good to be able to remember Mandela’s personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the dress of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman strives throughout the film to bring together two racially and day-to-day mutually distinct groups of people, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also takes on the World Cup, which South Africa won at the time, in his role in the South African National Rugby Dress.
For the entry of the grass in the dress, which in South Africa is almost like a sacred act, fourteen years ago Mandela harvested large ovations, mostly from the white audience and has thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may be accomplishing it to reunite people into a single people, led by rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve will only show.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as for example in a recent interview for LN the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, has revealed.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water-foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the safety operation of the pipeline system, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will be quantified only after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For over 10 years, nothing like this has happened with the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the spokesperson of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is the sole operator of the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical lines in the Czech Republic.
It maintains, refurbishes and develops 39 switchgear systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into the distribution system and line line with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jancura files criminal charges for libel against three leaders of the CSSD.
Today, the owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is filing a criminal complaint for libel against three social democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute interview with the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three directors attack us and say that we take out the raisins, while we have only submitted the offer beyond the scope, as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railway, because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway, which were completed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this defamation of the company Student Agency, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he said that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the prosecution to be a continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I am also calling for more leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional single-lane traffic and uses false and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that it has invested several million crowns in the advertising, which will point to the disadvantageous step of the districts.
He told the Radiojournal that he wants to interrupt the campaign after Christmas and continue it after the New Year.
He stated that he would lead the anti-corruption campaign as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on the operation of regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and had not tendered for the order in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to criticism of train traffic in the districts, he was also threatened, according to Jancura, by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up that we could lose the bus licenses as well.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who he is, I do not say his name, Jancura told the Radiojournal today.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococci will change the usual from January.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But even now, voices are reporting that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcus culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that the health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
Re-vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
Starting in January, children can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcus, which was born on August 2 of last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Those who have started the vaccination already in the last year or earlier will also have to pay for further revaccination themselves.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child's life.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children, four doses are required.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year on the vaccine doses.
However, they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children’s area vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including cerebral palsy and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections in our country kill up to 28 children up to 10 years old every year after examination in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease has been introduced in some 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January onwards, it will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
For example, the head of the Nahlas Civil Society, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association is already promoting long-term pneumococcal vaccination.
The experts at the international conference in which our association participated were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we managed to enforce at least that.
“I think that’s the way we have to go now,” Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this moment we do not consider it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, the chairwoman of the Society of Practical Pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
"In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a volunteer," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococcus from next year.
The vaccine against pneumococcus is also groundbreaking in that it is paid for as the first area vaccination by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, saving them for further treatment, Cabrnochova said.
Doctors need to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern of the practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of the vaccines.
After the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the state to them.
Some MEPs feared, however, that the insurance companies could "export the money out of health insurance."
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practitioners will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
According to the Pennsylvania Police Department, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while inviting 90 paintings into his vehicle with a trailer.
It is said that Frank Frazetta Jr. and another man used a excavator to invade the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his depiction of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press reported, the artist stopped in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police official who said Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that, according to a police sworn statement, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father to "enter the museum with all means necessary to bring all the paintings into a warehouse."
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior has denied having given any permission.
Labour Defends State and Tax Increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary report against criticism from the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had “passed away” an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor was also under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent cap on public payroll for 2011.
Social insurance aggressors
The trade unions have protested that low-wage recipients will be punished for a recession they did not cause and warned of imminent “problems.”
The rise in social security — to around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year — has angered the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, even though the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
CONCLUSIONS OF THE VORAB STATEMENT REPORT
Increase in social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% Tax on Banking Bonuses
1 Percent Increase in Corporate Tax for Small Businesses Rejected
Tax discounts for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of state pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 per year will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person with <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 annual income will be richer by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their deficit-mitigation target by 2013 meant “difficult decisions,” but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on the top 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms disputed that the outlined tax increases and spending cuts compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone".
"These are big numbers, they will bring us the deficit halving and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions about future economic growth – which affect the extent of new debt and the speed of deficit relief – were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year — far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April — while debt would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously projected.
"Missed Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion in debt is unsustainable over the next six years.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how they will repay this and press "cynic" for difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't say anything of importance about what they were going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond, "they had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be kept from future cuts, unlike in the proposals of the Conservatives, who see the deficit cap coming faster and faster.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money raised by the tax hikes and spending cuts will be used to cover spending for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April - the Chancellor would be subject to the charge of capturing votes, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra aid when people need it most and that the situation be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the ministers have not announced state details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said the Treasury’s figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defense.
“It only shifts the pain to later,” said its director Robert Chote.
“The important announcements are only made after the election, whoever wins them,” added Roger Bootle, an economics adviser at accounting firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates arrests of U.S. citizens in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist ties in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
“Of course, if they are American citizens, we are very interested in the indictments they are being charged with and the circumstances under which they are being detained,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are indeed the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had already taken an interest in the house and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said the United States must “engage more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradicating the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns 'abuse' in Iran
According to a report by Amnesty International, Iran’s human rights situation is still as bad as it has been for the past 20 years.
The report details "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man, quoted in the report, said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes; another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the start of the protests, the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak penal facility.
But since then, there has been no tolerance for criticism on the part of the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with “working with Facebook networks” and protesting against the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half-conscious, released on the street, Amnesty said.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former inmate who said he and 75 others had been detained for more than eight weeks in a container at a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government’s reactions to it, but if Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these bodies were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said at least 90 people have been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park was set up skihang
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a racing track.
The ski slope of this parking event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre-long slope.
Student John Hickman, who is studying medicine in his fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the hill, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the lights of the city glittering below.
He added, "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talent."
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces of art executed on the slope - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.

Can Islam be French? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is widespread concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most explanatoryly secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely reasoning study of a disputed effect that the country has shared and dealt with for over a decade and a half.
Bowen’s latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it “Islamic Free Spaces.”
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the questions that most disturb them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or city hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he argues, that make up daily life, quite in contrast to the political dramas that the media engages in.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, possibly except Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
You don’t have all the arguments on your side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interviewed Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He rather recognizes a "hardening of the value screws" as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The World's Most Uncomfortable View
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts at an alarming speed and takes life with it that can’t survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have moved into the recently open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their waters.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Wandering through the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proven themselves in the hunt for polar bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old flag-bearer to the sea, who fought only with the gunpowder of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically own one millionth of the habitat of a wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore has become quite green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America, and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sled-driven Inuit use powerful assault rifles to bring their prey to the track.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future might evolve.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanations.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering journeys in the late 19th and early 20th centuries suggested for the first time the turmoil of pack ice.
In the Cold War, submarines had the shifting ridges when undertaking.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by saltwater drainages that are compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened once the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it could be us.”
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington.
De'Angello Robinson arrived on the bus for seven hours to place a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they walked.
“In a few months, from wherever we are being brought back, we could be,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
It’s now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey each year, stop in various cities along the way to hold events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving something back to those the victims brought.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers targeted older graves from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing, and couples were holding hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the top.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends clung to each other in the icy air.
Some read the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white place cards that had been stuck in the moist mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears before her son’s grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of Marine Infringement Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I've been gone for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, foreign ministry officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
U.S. consular officials in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The special indictments have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything on the charge of "danger."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to heighten tensions between the Castro-brother’s communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will pay in return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely restricted on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the U.S. interest representative in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the donation of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", who recently released a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba".
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at a time when both countries are moving towards each other for more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials unveil plans to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who are radicalizing young men on the Internet.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he found them because one of them had commented on terrorist attacks on the internet video site YouTube.
Upon their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official briefed on the matter said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to subvert the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to the Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men – who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI – underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. Secret Service has made it a matter of the utmost urgency to accommodate human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not allow in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
U.S. volunteer recruits are being subjected to a special test by A Kaida, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also seen as immensely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst with the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow access to, as the U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed, Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of Thousands Demonstrators Demand Climate Action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding from the negotiators in the city’s Bella Congress Center bolder action on climate protection.
Demonstrators said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be around 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists set fire to small explosives near some government buildings in downtown.
One day, when the UN-sponsored climate talks were taking place, thousands of activists wandered through the city with banners in English saying "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish declaring "The Earth says "Enough".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, her mother’s birthplace, makes her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is struggling with due to the already perceptible impacts of climate change.
That’s part of the motivation for why I decided to take part in the big demonstration – to spread the word and appeal to world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no way around it anymore.
Police stopped protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothes set fire to several explosives near the Copenhagen main canal, near which there are several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as light rockets, but then were followed by “a few big explosions.”
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Examination data show stubborn racial air
The testimonials on math performance were welcome good news for public schools in Washington D.C. last week.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the country’s top performing schools, evidence shows that fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but that of their African-American peers rose only by three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eighth graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score achieved by the children of both groups has increased over this period of time, the difference has now barely decreased by 58 points.
Some of the district’s education advocates expressed concern last week that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already high-performing children.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group advocating for education equality in Washington, D.C..
I’m not jumping up and down for a range of two or three points,” said Democratic Washington City Councillor Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the exam scores is that the city’s secondary schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we are not spending nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district needs to continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, who have not mastered the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school careers, and who are significantly behind their peers of the same age.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and lifelike experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, has been brought to Washington under former head school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is credited with some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think we need to keep working to make the best measures available to students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performing schools needed to bridge the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who is investigating urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could have political repercussions that are working against this important agenda item.
The weakness is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that she is trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to make sure we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public school education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements to closing the performance gap is extending the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers’ union last year over 185 days a year, which he sees as “a milestone” on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The coach arrives at Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was buried in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight classmates in the group exploring Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, was more that of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully embraced the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of Hispanic immigrant children born in the U.S. who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education necessary to rise to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” of Hispanic Americans graduates from college – which is a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who examine high-performing children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive for success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if these efforts persist for a long time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point won’t solve the problem either, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis who studied Hispanic American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela’s college tour is a useful example.
It’s known as GEAR UP – A One-Way Up – and provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to launch college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they graduate high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry Signs Contracts with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild their damaged infrastructure at two auctions on Saturday.
Iraq’s oil ministry’s 10 contracts with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of Iraq’s oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
U.S. companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven U.S. companies had paid for participation in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has pulled the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of U.S. companies, Asians and Europeans are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were underscored by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. military, have likely prevented U.S. oil companies from engaging more strongly in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest proven crude oil reserves, analysts said.
U.S. companies were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to hold shareholders accountable.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into contracts with the ministry.
Major U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties to Iraq’s oil ministry and have sided with technical advice in recent years, have come out empty.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said, that China is on track to become one of the world’s great economies as well as a technology powerhouse.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its partners and fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
For the bidding, pre-selected companies issued bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner killed in Pakistan
An apparent U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan is said to have killed a top Al Qaeda deployment planner this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
This would be, if confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior official of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan’s lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian intelligence official from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants rushed to the spot and quickly took what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited indeterminate evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia has been described as the Al Qaeda’s leading military planner, leading operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the sensitive nature of the US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Assuming its central role as given, this also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top al Qaeda leaders and implemented them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somalia had risen rapidly in the Al-Qaeda hierarchy and had the best connections to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has fallen from an average of six operations per month to two this summer, according to a summary from the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a nonprofit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their attackability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
UN envoy to Kabul resigns
U.N. envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday he would step down in March, ending a tumultuous term that has been clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed Afghan presidential election.
The Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the troop increase, but he also expressed concerns that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which is set to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to assist in Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but only fulfilling an agreement made to his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so that he has time to arrange for a replacement.
What I’ve said is that he better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun his search for a replacement.
U.N. officials say he considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the U.N. mission in Baghdad, and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously led U.N. peace operations.
Eid’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied all the allegations, but he also said the allegations by Galbraith - who was fired - "have undoubtedly caused damage to the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership would allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries who are donating to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence that their money will be used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment over the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN recruitment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I could hire only one person.
This is catastrophic and should not go on like this.
U.S. Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for not participating in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a seven-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplaying the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options in Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that’s on my mind is if we’ve learned something from Iraq in the last six years that’s given the war its own unpredictability.”
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Syrian.
He said a “package of positive and negative incentives” is needed “to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons” because “their people will suffer tremendously” under the sanctions.
In a statement on Friday, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government joined the European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect “credible” consequences if it does not use its nuclear program to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should be acquired only for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear program and forgo a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But Iran appears to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because Iran's leadership disagrees on whether to commit to the United States.
That Iran has left the international community with a few proposals that they had already approved in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way that they have never been in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama set Dec. 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “squeezing sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian delegation to the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "unfounded and unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, saying that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers to "make a long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to lower the conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to dispel Kurdish concern about the impending troop withdrawal. U.S. representatives quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, “We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
Changing course in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that told them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave".
These lessons they learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course this summer due to the low birth rate and the aging population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and definitive: “Never mind.”
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, nothing is left, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, twisted single children, affectionately called “little emperors,” a population crisis is brewing in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN estimates.
The Department of Population Affairs is set to increase the number of people aged 60 and older from 16.7 per cent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 per cent by 2020, which is well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older adults accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said couples in childbearing age must have babies to help “reduce the ratio of the aging population and alleviate the labor shortage of the future.”
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step-by-step relaxation
Enshrined in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy will face huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplaces.
Chinese state representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of the country’s natural resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to abort.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions performed, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples with two children who are single.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out city employees and family planning volunteers to look for couples at home and to push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice to those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said there was a surge in requests from couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are still received per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the number of births in the city expected for 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and this is also legally allowed.
But they own, like many Chinese, only a tiny health and life insurance policy of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West mistakenly rate the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
The problem is not simply in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said she only wanted a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to having everyone take care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-aged parents with double careers, through which the birth rate drops, he said, it’s about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don’t want to live such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, poses huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the spatial question -- "You have to renovate your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you have to have a resume for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Drafts Plan for Emission Reduction
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been marked by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has once again put a spotlight on Friday with the publication of a document that will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the most recent major industrial nations in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that runs out of time, as more than 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a UN working group created specifically for this purpose, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature rise should be that would be borne by policy makers.
The process will be given a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN’s leading climate watchdog, Yvo de Boer, has called “the big deal.”
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which industrialized nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also gave an impetus to Friday's talks by ensuring that over the next three years it will provide $3.6 billion a year to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks had determined last week.
U.S. Climate Commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if these are not financed by industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is heading a harder line with China than representatives of the Bush administration not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging markets standing up and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern made his statement an hour after China’s Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei’s statement that it was either lacking “reason” to the leading American climate negotiator or it was “highly irresponsible” from him that he said earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially.
As the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, there have been breaks both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging countries.
The current struggle relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States fighting over their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have gone on to act more aggressively to make the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions pay for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, says Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although leading participants said the talks would, at best, lead to a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the small island states’ offensive “exercises political pressure on the entire political process,” partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most of the open issues still need to be clarified before the arrival of the heads of government to come to an agreement.
High-ranking representatives such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s Deputy Minister stepped out of their planes and paused through the hallways of the Bella Center for meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to shove down claims that will be negotiated over the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people walk into and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists stage nightly shows mocking the countries they think are betraying and selling, and hand-to-hand drafts of contracts are being forwarded instead of emailing them -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday there will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global politics of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
UK’s first 225 km/h faster train redefines Monday’s feeling
Monday morning at 5 p.m., a pipe will pierce the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The country’s first high-speed shuttle train will reach 225 km/h on its lightning ride from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will then take Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin shuttle service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect the UK to an international rail network of faster, more reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become lively commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced and the change from plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the unavoidable planning battle and fears of environmental damage in the UK’s high-speed rail tracks, could still pull the brakes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will deliver the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
As a result, it receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new line, which is to connect London to the West Midlands, will pass through urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open field, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final track.
HS2 is also expected to create three options for a larger, northward-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route guide, in which a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split into or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
“It seems to be the best-functioning option,” said one railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not open before 2025, would allow travelers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today’s slightly over an hour.
The designs offered the trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400-metre-long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can ride on it.
Up to 18 trains could operate per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal would be needed in London, where 20,000 passengers per hour could be served.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing train station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will not be made until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he puts the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would mean that the journey time between London and Scotland would continue to be over three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial tipping point in order to ensure a change from aircraft to rail, a guideline for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers come up for mortgage for <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 orangery of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservatives’ leading lower house member, has billed the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his home in his constituency.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that lower house members had to live “on lean rations,” has raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to allow himself to build an oak timber-framed farm at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House of Commons approved the applications at the time, and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the spending of the members of the House of Commons. Last night, Duncan said the applications "couldn't have been cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the lower house, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a spending checkpoint of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden, which is called "Orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked by the Standards and Privileges Committee to comment on increased cash withdrawals during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts.
The Committee cleared him last month of breaches of the rules following an examination of his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the collateral for a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000) mortgage from his London house to his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,500) a month as mortgage interest reimbursed by March last year.
In April, its claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate on Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, suggesting that the entire increase was used to fund the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 (85,000 euros) withdrawal.
The normal RBS mortgage rate dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 a month this May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him after he said after the spending scandal that MPs would live “on lean rations.”
“Essentially, working for the state means you have to live off lean rations and how you’re being treated.”
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and claim a vanishingly small portion, measured by what belongs to it.
And I could have demanded the whole damned sum, but I don't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked in May for his spending when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he cleared with the Fees Office that this "could be considered an exaggerated claim".
An activist has dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn in the form of a pound after it became known that he had demanded 4,000 pounds ($4,500) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This was approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about evasion and slipping through or a curvature of the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all of your faithful to admire Brighton's beach huts advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new meaning of life as an interactive advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm with free mulled wine and traditional Mince Pies, stuffed with dried fruits, pastries.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer cleric of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society again.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and hold exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we try to express this through our spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate change, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could take effect from 2013 until Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 protesters, all dressed in black, had smashed shop windows with paving stones and hammers, a journalist from AFP said.
Anti-unrest police intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their estimates, were arrested mainly members of the “Blacks Blocs”, these extremely violent splinter groups that have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction", and has emphasized that about a hundred of them "were still detained in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A stage has been installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators arrived with busts and trains from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were also present.
About 3,000 people, most of them with sky blue raincoats, made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as they followed the call of the Earth’s friends to form “blue tides” for “climate justice”.
“Today we are taking to the streets to demand a reparation of ecological guilt in favor of the South,” said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, a figure of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, has given the start of the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and hoisted bandanas in which you celebrated the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches by a few hundred demonstrators took place to demand a vigorous approach against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "Strike".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The turnout was around 58% a few hours before the polling station closes, according to the Abkhazian Election Commission officials.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including former President Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
This election is a farce.
In turn, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under a safe total occupation, his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station located in a school in the capital city of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is in the east of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
"I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations," Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, said, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow in the previous year, as the one in Abkhazia leaves Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready for action, have arrested about 700 people on the verge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which by December 18 welcomes delegates from 193 countries, who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From the Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to invade.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening of candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators, all dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began beating disks, a journalist from AFP said.
Anti-unrest police officers immediately circled you in and intervened recklessly by throwing some of you on the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splinter groups that have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin due to a paving stone during incidents in which about twenty people were provisionally arrested, according to police. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said as the law enforcement helicopters circled in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who arrived by train or by car from major German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
“Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the South,” said Lidy Nacpil, an activist with the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
“We can’t say to each other anymore: we still have time,” says Benin singer Angélique Kidjo.
“In Africa, there are rivers that sink, there are waterways through which you can walk, which has never been the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has approached environmental protection organizations.
French MEP and globalisation critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer any difference today between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are addressing the masses.
The Asia-Pacific area, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, a few hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed in red with bandanas, have made publicity in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta to take action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organized by the "Network of 350" several hundred people gathered, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the fields of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the lycées.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du Dimanche" that the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the high schools, even if they are not compulsory in the terminal (12th year of school).
"The pupils of the Premi<0xC3><0xA8>re (11th year of school) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration of "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one," he continued. He emphasized: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals at technical lycées."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published by Humanité found that almost seven out of ten French people (69%) criticized the government's project to abolish compulsory education in history and geography in Terminal S (12th year of school with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized some of the rights of this project.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question as to a restriction of the philosophy of the S-terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) had called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which in their opinion falls victim to the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister concluded that they will undergo a professional aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an admissions test in which their teaching skills will be tested.
In addition, they carry out internships during the year in M2 and then teach one year before the pupils as teachers in the internship.
He went on to say, “If you add in all the internships offered before the performance test, you will achieve even more hours that you spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
The minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed that he wants to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen summit: that is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Eerst" conferences, at which experts address the audience with filmed contributions for fifteen minutes each.
We want to do something to reach people and to awaken in them the feeling of wanting to know more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the pool of the school.
“Among the experts, around twenty participants were selected, also according to their charisma,” he clarifies.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be set in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke to about 50 people only with the help of films.
"This is part of our role as scientists," he underlined, hoping that the audience could see that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school page from 15 December.
The next "Earnest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Delayed payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of law enforcement officials on Friday called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtimes that have been deferred for budget reasons until January are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Penitentiary Officers (FO-Penitentiaire) called on employees who do not have a service to demonstrate in front of the penitentiary on Tuesday morning and block it in order to draw attention to the “theft of what belongs to them”.
The 3rd Union of Penalty Officers (CGT-Penitentiaire) called for "to unite to a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of overtime, night surcharges and Sunday and holiday surcharges in December is considered "shameful and unacceptable".
The first union of law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for “general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger.”
The head of the penitentiary and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime had increased sharply in 2009 and not all of it was foreseen in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of law enforcement officials guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functioning and modernize it," the Justice Minister said in the letter.
"I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which has arisen from a lack of estimation of the resulting overtime, does not repeat itself in the future," added Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December salary is therefore low, except for the management staff who enjoy high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budgetary constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional union FO in Marseille indignantly announces, "all assemblies and summonses" to boycott until new instructions.
"Staff do not go to work on Sundays and holidays, if the hours from October to December are still not paid, and this also applies to their overtime," also threatens the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
“At a time when we are being charged with more and more tasks without hiring more staff, trying to enrich ourselves with staff funds is more than inappropriate,” said the Bordeaux CGT union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, says the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama believes he’s always distributing better Christmas gifts than he gets himself.
US President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family for the first time in the White House, told TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he’s always distributing better gifts than he gets himself.
In a special broadcast aired on ABC on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave insights into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
“Santa Claus also loves Bo,” Michelle Obama says, adding that the dog will of course also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts, saying, “I gave you beautiful gifts last year.”
"So please," he summoned her abusively, pointing to the First Lady's pearl chain: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour show in a casual atmosphere with the well-known television host who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about the gifts they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bike and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
“I remember when my father visited us one Christmas and brought me a basketball,” the president said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized I had this ball from him.”
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put it all on the wall instead of grouping it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Confirms He Was Put In An Artificial Coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles due to significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Opera Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had found "damage as a result of the surgery of a disc injury" that he had suffered in Paris on November 26.
The singer's production company wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
However, it was only after 48 hours that the patient was a little more certain about his condition than when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "certain sources indicate" that after its first operation in Paris, "no drainage" was put in place.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Parc Monceau due to a herniated disc.
The surgery, planned for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments to RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection following the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley", but he assured that there was "no need to worry" about the rock musician, as he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was nonsense to sit on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation," Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacted well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was contained."
Mr. Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he did not feel any particular concern.
Still, the singer’s health had grown increasingly concerned since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general amazement, Johnny Hallyday had a “small bowel cancer operation” that resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health issue has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer on stage had trouble moving.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to deny another hospitalization.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title at his favourite 50m freestyle distance at the Euro 2009 on the short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, when the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to reach the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two king distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croats Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
“You can believe in bigger and bigger and in this case I said, if the world record is in my reach, I will try.”
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer did not manage to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t make a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
U.S.: Tombstone at Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tombstone, which appeared exclusively with French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the 3rd century AD and was always valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, vice president of auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby's.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
“Selling is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what buyers have so far offered the most,” Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was housed in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use for it in her bathroom of her Parisian hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the III French Republic and President of the Council, before coming to the Marshal Pétain.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "Heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya’s attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil incompatible after the coup government rejected the move as unacceptable.
“After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya last night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibility of carrying out this transfer,” said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authority, the Mexican government-supplied plane, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelayas, returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to “need” Zelaya to abdicate and ask him for political asylum abroad under his guidance.
The ousted president, however, rejected this, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming, incumbent head of state.
The coup regime “has again failed by trying to move me to give up at my expense ... they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has frequently spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the fallen president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the guise of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted to us a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the Putsch Government, told the Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not ask for asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had replied in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose headquarters is located in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had stressed, would only take place as president of the Honduran people.
Rumours of an exit from the country had mobilized supporters of the overthrown president on Wednesday, who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, after which the military there had stepped up its efforts.
Brazil's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's stance.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day of the popular poll he organized in preparation for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Surprisingly, he had returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for high treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
Putsch President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
In the course of the contested election, Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States, but rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street is booming, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high, the figures of the U.S. trade balance testify to a price recovery of the shares of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the IPO figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq has risen from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Advanced Index Standard & Poor's 500 was written down at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from different industries, FTN Financial’s Lindsey Piegza said.
This, however, remains anecdotal under the premise that the market only focuses on “half-full glasses,” she moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are fixated primarily on U.S. trade balance figures, “which show an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
The analysts, on the other hand, had expected a deficit wax.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the company research Economy.com.
In return, the unemployment rate in the United States has risen against all expectations in the past week and has now reached the level of 474,000 inquiries.
However, the average value of new job seekers over the past four weeks has “fallen to the low point of the year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of 10-year government bonds rose to 3.482 % from 3.432 % on Tuesday evening, while the profitability of 30-year government bonds rose to 4.492 % from 4.408 % on the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of Partisans in power shout "Ladies in White"
Hundreds of Cuban-backed partisans on Thursday sacked the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day and thwarted another rally that temporarily detained a good dozen dissidents.
Around forty "Dames in White", wives or close political prisoners, were plucked out on the open road by government supporters under Raul Castro, just as they were on the march to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!", the empowered partisans chanted with raised fist against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilians who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana the previous evening, in which there were no injuries or arrests.
In Havana’s Vedado district, however, a dozen dissidents, who also attended the demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, a reporter from AFP confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents extorted by the partisans of the government under the use of force to enter civilian vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" have organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "Praying for the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the dissident list is about 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders of Macheitz's 20 years in prison.
Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities perceive the opponents of the regime as "soldiers" or "agents" in the service of the declared enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, in particular that of freedom of expression.
Madman kills 80-year-old with knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An insane man armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and injured five others on Friday against late afternoon at the main business hours in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old assailant had injured the eighty-year-old for previously unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a manager of the police union Alliance in the hospital, is succumbing to the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has a couple knitting with a pregnant woman.
The man, approximately in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured and taken to hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life because, according to police sources, he apparently had vital organs affected.
The pregnant woman became ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to police, is said to have escaped immediately on the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently by accident: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of whom was heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the Alliance syndicate of the Hauts-de-Seine region.
Several passers-by, including young people, are said to have tried to silence the madman, according to AFP witnesses.
I saw a guy in the threesomes with a green vest.
Three young men tried to intervene.
They didn’t make it because the guy was well-built, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the gunman and were injured with knife marks, according to police information.
The event took place in one of the main battlefields of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passers-by came to me to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put them in first aid position and noticed a clapping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came injured by cuts.
State police officers finally arrested the man, who did not carry any identification documents.
The prosecutor’s office of Nanterre has commissioned the district department of the criminal police department Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) with the investigation of the case.
The insane man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police queue does not rule out that he is sent to a nervous health facility.
According to another police source, six policemen were stabbed to death at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the act".
U.S.: Polanski’s lawyer calls for criminal prosecution to be stopped again
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland for a violation of morality of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of the "pianist", filed a complaint before three judges of the appeals court in the second district of California, alleging gross procedural errors at the time of the trial in 1977.
I demand on the spot criminal discharge, Hummel explained, before adding that the conduct of the judge charged with the case at the time of the trial, Laurence Rittenband, "let it run cold on one's back".
According to him, the now-deceased judge Rittenband, before he passed his verdict, discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a breeding house -- which constitutes a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: pursued and desired), especially by the prosecutor in question David Wells.
At the end of September, Wells declared that he had “lied” to the authors of the documentary.
Should the Court refuse to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel requests the conduct of a trial which would enable him to present the evidence for his argument.
For its part, the prosecution has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the removal of the facts charged to the accused cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, even before the proclamation of the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney General Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the hearing."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that escape is a way out?, asks Ms Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus disregards his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out that “there are other alternatives to escape”.
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the termination of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by every revival of the Polanski affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 on the basis of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and closes without a price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed without a price on Friday in a market that was torn between better indicators than expected in the US and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63 percent, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03 percent.
Based on the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the tech-dominated Nasdaq posted 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Advanced Index Standard & Poor's 500 rose by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is pretty quiet," said Mace, a silver-eyed Marblehead asset management firm.
"It remains tightly limited, the trading volume has become very small and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators that “contributed to improving the market’s view of the robustness of the economic recovery,” summarized Charles Schwab’s analysts.
In the U.S., retail sales rose by 1.3% in November, two months in a row, and far more than expected.
Consumer confidence in the U.S. improved significantly in December to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan Index Forecast.
However, the indices were slowed by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level against the euro for two months, pushing down the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation, said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
As a result, the technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
On Wednesday evening, the yield on the 10-year treasury bond increased by 3.540% compared to 3.482 % and the yield on the 30-year treasury bond increased by 4.497 % compared to 4.492 % the previous day.
Miss World election in South Africa
After a month’s tour of South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream of being voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is being held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a veritable swirl of pleasure.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn was simply extraordinary.
I’ve seen a lot of things and made a lot of experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone enthusiastically.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5pm CET.
I could not imagine a more beautiful country to surrender my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, stressed Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "stunning landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as to emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, it’s every woman’s dream to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be highlighted with music and dance.
The candidates parade in traditional costumes and not to forget in the swimsuit.
The show will be presented by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World Committee official Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that can hardly be surpassed, says Julia Morley, chairwoman of Miss World.
The candidates did a safari like last year, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time by bike and tasting the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone remarked.
Their most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise a little more for this event.
I’m wrong with people I would probably never be able to get close to.
I will definitely come back to the 2010 World Cup, promised with enthusiasm Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is “very positive,” his son David assured on Friday upon his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in hospital there for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he left the plane, where he arrived shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 MEZ) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would "quickly" go to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a bandaged disc accident on November 26.
The singer was put into an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to ease his severe pain and be able to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection following a bandaged disc surgery on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the sickening changes caused by the last surgery.
His wife, Laeticia, attended a school event Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter, Jade, goes to school, an AFP photographer said.
Yves Catoné, head of the department of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re Hospital, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the Los Angeles hospital.
The producer put a heavy strain on neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had committed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely disillusioned, Mr. Camus explained.
I have heard that a court case may be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "traveled far too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally phoned this doctor who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblematic, which had really surprised me, since I myself already have two band-aid surgeries behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the medical board, described him as "a man without scruples" who has "regular" responsibility before the board of directors and is "everything else as recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux issued a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would have been "perfectly completed" and the post-operative examinations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been raging since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that there is a bit too little for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), explained Mr. Camus.
The UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise) becomes energetic and urges the Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal
The party alliance, which is overseen by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou's MoDem party, on Friday reacted violently to an attempt to take over the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and did not prosecute him under threat of further prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political legacy after he handed the left the hand.
The Minister of Defense, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday in front of the NC National Council.
As a reminder of his efforts, he had received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now with NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF brand as he was the first to apply for it in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle".
However, the business office of the party alliance UDF, supervised by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they were not to be expropriated and set a deadline for the Minister and the MP, under the threat of legal prosecution, to no longer use this seal and to transfer the ownership rights of the brand to her.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and the Senator Jean Arthuis des Zentrums.
They also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement + Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF +, printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF office stated, and asks NC to “immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from all material and from (its) website.”
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the trademark's ownership rights to its legal rights holders".
If you refuse to do so, we will file a lawsuit against you in order to comply with the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave this in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the "UMP" party.
According to the signatories, the Nouveau centre party therefore has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They continue to recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem party and the establishment of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years at the time when he applied for the brand name" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the absence of the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
You also point out that this ruthlessness is the best way to turn into a crime, ironizing the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us, in politics as well as in life, more worthy to make a name for ourselves, rather than trying to get out of anonymity by cheating oneself, in a fraudulent way
Liliane Bettencourt: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier sentenced for exploiting weakness
The Nanterre court on Friday decided to judge the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has exploited a weak moment of the eighties to steal part of their fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will face trial on April 15 and 16, 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision means that, in fact, there will be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are torn apart while at the same time holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions laid down by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to present a report before March 10, 2010 in which you clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to be subject to these investigations.
“I will speak with her,” Mr. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
With regard to the lawyer of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers, Ms Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady who needs to be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother’s weakness for years to make donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or fines.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer she considers a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the advocates’ pleas on Friday led to a major family debacle.
Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer referred to three letters sent by her client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she mistrusted the husband of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers.
Liliane Bettencourt added: “Could you please explain to my daughter that I have been writing to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise since her marriage."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office is again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially as a guardianship judge has in recent days rejected her request to initiate judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor’s office’s representative.
The Court has now decided to give a judgment after the admissibility trial of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the big French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for the staff joining "values" determined to hang the best, as it was previously designed on the consumer products by the technicians in the factory.
By placing the customer at the center of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose preferences of the customers again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique <0x3D> economic intelligence) "demands from all parties involved ... a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach"; it demands from the employees a commitment that is totally contrary to the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we demand an operational revolution that would consist in placing employees at the center of the company’s concerns on an equal footing with the customers.
The Highly Conditioned Benefit of Internal Opinion Polls
Will the internal opinion polls, as the questionnaire that Orange submitted to its payroll recipients, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I could see that in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure finally comes to do primarily what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a highly simplified view of human behavior.
Out of the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the American “neurosciences” and unwittingly disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to activate the "leverage" (sic) to the engagement of employees, a current survey published by Le Figaro.fr reinforces Ipsos's leadership in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, a business revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of management: for the payees, engagement for the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize some of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa, which allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, corporate leaders can control, predict and predict their “social performance” and put their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favorable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: 'Just War' Brings Obama Praise from Right
The American right on Friday welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo the night before, and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the notion of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had mocked the award for Obama on October 9, this time applauded the president’s speech, following the example of the former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself had raised the issue of a “sometimes necessary” war in her memoirs just published.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, made efforts in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “very good work” in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, ex-president of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I felt this speech was entirely historical,” said Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show “The Takeaway.”
The previous MP, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that they "wouldn't be free and could not afford a price for peace if they could not afford it."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has given “a very American speech.”
In addition to portraying himself as a “cosmopolitan,” as “he always does,” he has “spoken like an American president” when he pointed out that Europeans “live in a security bubble that they didn’t create themselves and don’t do much to protect,” Gerson said.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Bush-era falcon, described the speech on the National Review Online website as “boring, high-pitched and uninspired.”
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends recourse to the armed forces.
If you wrap the war under the cover of justice, the massacre of the innocent can be easily justified, he warns.
The media of the moderate left, however, remains lavishly on the president’s side.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, called the speech itself a "monumentary work" for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent.
The Oslo speech “offers a timetable for managing international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California daily said in a statement.
The New York Times believes that Obama “proclaimed the necessary discourse” and calls his speech “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Long-distance riders: Three marathons for an agreement that will ensure the supply at Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employer organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that put an end to the strike order and the looming heavy supply squeeze at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "welcomed" the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement early in the morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and it was not until 18:00 that the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have caused a lot of damage to the company" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," according to Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
“That’s not much, but we start small first,” says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now being instructed not to block the supply centers anymore.
"However, there will probably always be some resentments that are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good deal", although it was "difficult to accommodate these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said there was "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and for the maintenance of the overall state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, in particular, make it possible to address the issue of the 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of the collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the drop in taxes for employers in the amount of 100 million euros" was the subject of a government amendment to the bill on corrected finances for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government called for an “identical” vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to that organisation and then, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour, to the entire profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time", assures Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The association FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to displace the goose eaters on the coming Christmas days, complains the Unostra.
For the association Otre, the agreement threatens "the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months a big grave".
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
Disruptions on the RER A line, France's largest high-speed rail network for the Paris metropolitan area and the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France, continued over the weekend, during a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the trade unions and the leadership of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), the strikers were left with their demands for wages.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains running between 10:00 and 20:00.On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central route only one of four trains was ready for use.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced the travelers to move.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is striving to connect the large stores with traffic".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains was scheduled to run at main traffic time, and almost none during low-traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no crowd on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly due to the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), stated that he would have stood up extra "one and a half hours early to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to passengers by staff and law enforcement, pointed out that there were no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by SNCF on line RER A or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via Saint-Lazare station to ensure connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the strikers’ main meetings again took place, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as “poor” after meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud) they are demanding a long-deadened wage surcharge.
The CGT was indignant that the RATP itself was putting its salary proposals at risk, stressing that the leadership "is not able to solve a problem, while this was possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting was scheduled for Monday to "extend the comprehensive examination of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers searched the headquarters of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership that rejected any discussion during the strike to date, and suggested a meeting after a calming down of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after a prior announcement by UNSA and Independents.
The associations demand a salary supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travelers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross salary of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a salary surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party; a decision that followed immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years, enormously difficult.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," according to the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, the decision would have been unanimously taken by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to suspend the dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were suspended from the police for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders said before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than act like non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the Turkish Federal Court Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "wisdom" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and numerous other countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party claims to have "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court works in between the government, which is striving to confront the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to overcome the support of the PKK by the Kurds and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan in recent weeks had led to clashes with the police.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP’s premises in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The police used tear gas grenades and water jets when the demonstrators began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the verdict, Turk assumed that the court’s decision would “further deepen the desperation.”
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish, annotated) issue on the basis of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
“We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of democratic openness promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Insel.
"Obviously, one can think of a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crisp winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
But so that its employees can try out the entire vehicle technology and learn to master it.
This could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-tracks will be taken off with large-scale vehicles, explains Braubuer.
These include major traffic and transit routes such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighting access, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and tracks with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at 3 a.m.
The approximately 1040 kilometers should be sprinkled in a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it snows only at 7.30am.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter service, "because then no one is ready to make room for the scattered vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not snow further, are supply and development roads, which also includes the Rat Beil road, on the line.
The last priority has side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES are on their way, danger points and transitions are cleared as a priority.
For the most part, the FES cannot take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which mainly keeps an eye on the bridges from 10 to 4.30 pm, says Brauburger.
Since there is a rapid smoothness on this, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the sprinkler is on the way.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-long animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
Had the species lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the journal Science on Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the kinship relationships, the spread and the characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History reports.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund Confirms Theories About Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually you can find only single fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the attribution of these ancient dinosaurs is usually controversial.
For example, experts are debating when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor, and also the birds, which are known as the "long-necked" examples of the four-legged sauropods of the Oropods and their relatives (the frennocens).
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacs, as they also possess the descendants of theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air sacs, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also possessed airbags and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America over all parts of the earth, which at that time formed a single land mass as the supercontinent Pangaea.
This is due to the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, this could be a distorted picture, because in South America there are only a few primitive Dino fossils preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptilian tribe to the dominant land vertebrates of the Earth’s Middle Ages is still puzzling.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and fly auras and numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the kinship on the border from the Triassic to the Jurassic extinction.
Success story didn’t last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the competition off the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to flourish, which had also already developed in the Triassic, and since then has been tempting a shadowy existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe-Universität hits waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers from Goethe University, as well as from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police action initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the building occupied by students and lecturers on the educational strike last week because walls and artwork had been smeared.
Five students were injured in the incident.
The damages, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by a police command".
The evacuation represents an “unacceptable interference” in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and diverts from the content.
The Bureau has shunned the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of occupants did not support the property damage, it is said.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Federation are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about one’s own future, says Verdi-Landesjugendsekretär Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the vice president and the police.
We are grateful to the Vice President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a Current Hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition SPD, Greens and the Left saw this differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the students’ arguments and demands, they were cleared.
The Left has tabled a motion urging the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a heavily guarded site for secret military research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, Selenograd’s representatives had been in contact with the Frankfurt-based Riedberg science site – with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow's Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, and Edwin Schwarz, the Planning Officer, signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchanges
It is a matter of continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ will be able to take a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to collect orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssiyskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for armaments research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the laying of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital for a decade into unhealthy construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
At that time, railway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were considered to be 19th-century traffic fossils, which acted like brake pads of modern rail traffic, as it once took an enormous amount of time to span locomotives from the back to the front.
Drive in, hold down, keep going - that's how it should go.
And that is why the main train stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is actually being approached now, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and Bavarian big city to implement the deepening.
However, head stations also no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turnstiles with motor vehicles and control cars at both ends.
Still: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now being tackled.
Local and local politicians have done it.
The train also contributes because the risks of the Republic’s largest single infrastructure project are borne by the taxpayers and not by the state corporation.
In terms of urban planning, the project can still be justified in some ways.
A new urban space is being created, which - it is believed that the computer-generated graphics of the planners - will be equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger traffic, which was attributed - typically in the 80s - to huge growth.
At that time, there was no competition from the low-cost airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road transport by truck.
However, the new construction route is not suitable for freight trains due to steep slopes.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly also touches many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros will be pledged in Swabian.
This is the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade the money will be lacking at other junctions and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the well 180 kilometers long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built at the speed of time.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley Route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government Examines Judgment on Airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go into revision against the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling legally reviewed, Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
On those days, the VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that in the event of the construction of the planned Nordwest Landbahn at Frankfurt Airport, the country would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 p.m., as provided for by the state government, is not compatible with the legally required protection of the population from nocturnal aircraft noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to revise the ruling.
The opposition criticized the delay and urged government officials to refrain from a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD faction leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election for a night flight ban, otherwise this would be seen as a "breach of word".
It’s damn hard to keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP’s election slogan “We keep the word.”
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government is still trying to get to their night flights with "legal perversion and trickery".
A thorough legal examination needs your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, his group’s statements on the night flight ban have never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The crisis-torn U.S. big banks are stripping away their state bonds.
The Bank of America on Wednesday repaid aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp amounting to a total of $45 billion (worth 30 billion euros) at a stroke.
Citigroup also plans to reimburse state aid, according to a report by the U.S. broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that came with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had raised $19 billion in fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by savings sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The splash of money has helped over a very difficult time.
At the height of the financial crisis, the House of Money took over Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also intends to obtain money on the capital market in order to free itself from its liabilities to the State.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a roughly $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Quick Choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed incumbent editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the personnel.
Favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, in order not to proceed with the procedure.
However, it may also have played a role not to further damage ZDF-Intendant Markus Schächter, should this proposal not be passed on to the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote has not yet been determined at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a severe defeat for Schenker, but one expected.
For the majority of the Union's board of directors had signalled weeks before the election that they would not confirm Brender in office.
The resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had been organized.
With the argument that under Brenner the ZDF news broadcasts had lost in turn-on rates, he refused another term of office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until just before the election, there were therefore protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was flogged.
Recently, even 35 state lawmakers had interfered in the debate, who considered Koch’s actions to be unconstitutional.
It has no use.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
After that, he worked at Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the "today's journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the election of Brender, who was still elected as journalist of the year by the Branchenblatt Medium magazine on Wednesday.
Koch’s counterpart on the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the staff proposals of the intendant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory boards of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever chess move - by criticizing the board fiercely for it immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to be nominated for the position of Editor-in-Chief by the nominees without losing his face, as well as by the Board of Directors, without being suspected of taking a party member to office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is anyway attributed to the left-liberals.
Studying is thwarted
Partial success for the students: After a year of the education strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally joined in on Thursday: at a meeting of ministers of culture and university rectors conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should also be able to complete their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the exam burden: in principle, each study module should be completed with only one exam.
In addition, the workload of the students is to be checked and "a realistic and reasonable measure" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed to making common structural requirements for undergraduate and master’s degree programmes more flexible.
Moreover, there should be no deviating national regulations.
Less Examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have carried the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
This is the first time it has been filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of exams in part drastically: "Each module usually concludes with only one exam", it says in a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of degree programs.
With the “significant reduction of the exam burden,” said the Accreditation Board Chairman Reinhold Grimm, “a failure development that significantly impaired studyability should be halted.”
In addition, "studyability" should be "the decisive criterion" in the design in the future.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" for "unnecessary constraints on students' choice of language".
“Events” should be avoided.
The students would have "claim to maintain playrooms that enable and promote self-initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses of study, but also to the review of existing courses of study.
These have to be “reaccredited” every five years – which means it will take until 2015 to review all courses of study.
Ten accreditation agencies throughout the country are responsible for this, which are subject to the Accreditation Council established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had urged the countries "with emphasis" to influence the agencies in such a way that the fill of substances is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In some federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has allocated additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities will mainly set up tutoring programs and strengthen study counseling as well as examination and foreign offices.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros for this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a novelle of the Higher Education Act in Parliament.
After this, only one examination is required to complete a study model.
The design of the studies is to be more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of evidence of performance at other universities and facilitating access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the country will be checked for their feasibility.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again argued over the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Juso-Higher Education Groups called for the design of education policy to be stopped in the future "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students should now also "meet a little bit" as affected.
The future academics received support from the president of the University Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of the students," she said Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture with whom the HRK consulted on a common reform paper.
The trade union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor’s degree access to a further master’s degree program.
On the other hand, countries need to ensure that the current generation of bachelor students will have enough master’s degree places available tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, according to GEW Board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not say anything about free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and leaving is almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner, in which he discusses the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his speaking space.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Söllner first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literature awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt Poetics lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He provided considerable extra-literary attention last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, where it was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and razor mirror of its security acts".
Visibly unsure and embarrassed, Söllner left a statement in which he confessed to Romanian German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, that he had worked as an I.M. for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts to recruit would have begun sluggishly, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, “someone who has not resisted attempts by the Securitate to intimidate himself enough.”
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that highlights the abysmal and humiliating nature of a political system that is based on
Werner Söllner is, to the best of his knowledge, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate Act, IM Walter played a role, said the literary scholar Michael Markel after Söllner’s confession and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He “cut him out” in all the difficult points for him at the time, according to Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner’s statement was in the form and unexpected in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not completely surprising.
Germany had been a cosy reserve for Securitate-Spitze, Herta Müller had already written in July after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, it may be assumed, are speculated and in some cases have probably also known which clear name was hidden behind the nicknames Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to the very safe sighting of the Stasi acts in this country, the handling of the legacy of Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic enlightenment has been hampered and hindered in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities of the corresponding National Council for the Preparation of Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was not established until 1999, but the publication of the acts has since been rather sluggish.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of records.
That the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, showed in an interview in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar spoke abhorrently about the winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, they only interrogated her once.
The infamy of power was here thought to be completely undisguised in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the Söllner case, as so often in connection with concealed guilt, raises unavoidable questions.
The thoughtful response of the listeners to Söllner’s confession makes it hopeful that the continuation of this chapter will be determined rather by urge to know than by blame and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just a well-dressed outside servant coming from a very nice Christmas party, at which a sports goods manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB-trainer Christian Gross accompanied an orange plastic bag of the outfitter a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the distinctive glaze let himself be chauffeured because of the city still foreign to him.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in the game after all, and drunk before luck was the 55-year-old just as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or just start right.
In the words of the Swiss only three days earlier committed: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: there will be a brutally hard fight against the descent."
The “much more important task” is ahead of us on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the royal-class performance in the daily life of the league in Mainz.
And to put off the newly revealed weaknesses after the fast three goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Lottery
The Champions League Eighth Final (plays 16/17 + 23/24 February / replays 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be played on December 18 in Nyon.
So the joy of the fulminant state of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only with the supposed savior, who had given the insecure Stuttgarter professionals confidence, willingness to work and joy in the game in a short time.
I approached the players and told them to think about their strengths, and stopped them from being braver, explained Seelenklempner Gross, the simple-sounding recipe for success, which under therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He has ignited some magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who advanced to the best player on the pitch after a weeks of injury break thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new boss's way of working: "He is a man who takes on and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel it had obviously been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs Konstanz above all.
Like Gross, players and managers were also careful to overestimate the victory against a substitute-weakened and completely overworked defense of the Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening came to mind, Khedira said.
And sports manager Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was reached, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not ready to celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to the events of the weekend, which came to life in the form of a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of leadership weaknesses and decided to change trainers under pressure from puberty fans.
Even that his free day had been cancelled after games, Lehmann valued it as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann’s statements were “characterized by pure egoism,” Keildt backed away and announced consequences for the final man.
They will no longer be friends for life, the two 40-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with all the others that without the preparatory work by the replaced training team the playful and combatively strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," Heldt and Lehmann said unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
World Championships in Heavyweight
Hot duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson again and again provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the version of the WBC.
The verdict of the points judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains world boxing champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night in Bern.
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already twice been the world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it did not work with the K.O. that everyone expected.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2.02-meter Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight primarily with his left-handed leadership.
However, the eleven-centimeter-smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly escaped the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had provided some vortexes before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an “ugly zombie” who “can’t do anything right”.
During the weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years off, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I only got one shot in this fight and I am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
The WBA's belt is worn by David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-metre-tall Nikolai Walujev in November.
Haye had earlier this summer canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September.
Its promotion company is reportedly already planning the fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar for misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left are demanding clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has subjected a deliberate deception.
The minister said about the deadly bombing of two tanker trains in September "knowingly the untruth", Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It’s called a lie: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the hijacked cargo, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to a NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the U.S. airstrike requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy – and whether the Chancellor’s Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have endorsed this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor’s Office has not had any influence on concrete actions of the Federal Armed Forces in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the Ministry’s presentation on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert had also become loud.
According to information provided by the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs correctly and fully informed about the background of the tanker attack.
Officially, they denied the existence of the NATO reports and deprived the minister of sensitive details.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, it stated that they had even pointed to several reports to the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document by the commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, it is said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the Bundestag's committee of inquiry, which wants to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see pictures in waking state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in the mentally ill and in drug cravings that the boundaries between imagination and reality blur.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we are allowed to give ourselves unhindered to the wildest ideas and fantasies.
However, those who experience dreamlike states in adulthood, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, at least as specialty.
But such images and voices arise not only in the mentally ill or in drug cravings.
Guilt has our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
Dreamlike altered states of consciousness can occur in a wide variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of abduction, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messenger substances of the brain - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is detached and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often occur during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him.
The connection of madness and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of irresination with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the imperfections, delusions, senses".
It’s autumn 2001, when Henning T. turned into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and quietly coloured.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devilish shapes with blood-red, distorted frets, tooth-brushing.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo, knots them to a sling and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a loudspeaker and puts the sling around his neck.
- Jump.
The sling is loosening.
This is supposed to be a lesson to you, the voices in the drumming chorus shout, "go to the clinic and be healed!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he is married.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
Falsehood is a cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, people can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they end up in an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution madness.
Particularly common is voice listening – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the doors to a flood of ideas and fantasies that stem from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he becomes in a passive role, he is overwhelmed by the events, similar to in the dream, and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A balance of reality is usually not possible for them, the deceptions are cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in your life
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain strikes caprioles, researchers are still figuring out.
Exceptional conditions can cause any person to lose the relationship to reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the determining factors alone.
Researchers believe that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains Fox.
But there remains a mystery as to how the disorder of the neural system comes about, which at first does not manifest itself over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role – stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains are hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medications to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get them, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether fake images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of position.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and deceptions for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are one of the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
These include, in addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, often also diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and cranial trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, so box, are composed of memory contents that are usually retained.
They arise when areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain runs hot or even when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But it is also deprivation of attraction, stress, love anxiety or other mental states of emergency.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attending high school there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If it weren’t for the pictures and the voices.
In the break, it can happen that a sluggish boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
When it responds to him, the classmates look at it in surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spunky daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a moment.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other fake pictures are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are usually frightening
Often the deceptions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material, because the teacher is just introducing a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations to everyone else on the board.
At night, the symptoms are usually frightening.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes much too rarely and much too late, she often can’t tell whether she’s awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees are the frowns or the girl with the bleeding cuts to her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she yells at the figures.
Parents and friends don’t tell her anything that would make her crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She passed the Abitur last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she made contact with the psychologist’s box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she’s not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from stimulus withdrawal, they are most likely to have hallucinations after a while, Kasten says.
I suspect the brain is then underemployed and provides its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she’s called dad has not been her physical father since she can think.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to differentiate between fake images and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is in the brain, reality is formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
Even nocturnal dream pictures value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their falsehoods as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world that is too conscious, imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and head of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also contains positive, creative – madness is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of dreamlike altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers to be real and that he cannot distinguish from the waking state even in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis at full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intense form of sense-founding and meaning-making in an inherently unbearable situation that allows us humans our own creative ability not to sink into a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after heart valve surgery followed by heart transplant, while his body is doomed to immobility at the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-made world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who produce drugs from blood.
Dragged by a Greek on a motorcycle to his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snowy Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
It goes on completely in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental journeys are still unclear to me after years and in secondary details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug cravings show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are also in waking.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist’s box, “can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen is an intermediate solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
In the future, the holding company will also belong to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have carefully arranged the details of this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
The question is also whether they are capable of this.
You cannot introduce your children to 7500 employees if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This also kills the children and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would retire from the board of directors from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
Later, the treasury department was responsible for the company’s assets, and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the list.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from demise: "This was always about families who were infected by a craving for capital, who have completely speculated and thought that they could become such a big player.
That was never my strategy.
He had "never had world power dreams," according to Burda.
I do not see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the World League with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
The Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is about body care.
The spa area, located on the 8th floor, includes well-known companies such as Hedonai, which provide laser hair removal; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its teahouse with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends on your feet and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen located opposite the devices.
Thereafter, various videos show you how to perform your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are completely enough to train the body muscles.
And if after you have trained your body, you still want to visit the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments are offered to restore the beauty, shine and health of your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and that’s why it’s again a good opportunity to copy the looks of the stars and get their party dresses in our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté, of which one can only abrade.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and agree on mobility through management, coordination, subsidization, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize the opinions and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to push forward the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, activities related to energy and, in particular, their performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups throughout Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
Prime Minister José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has warned the Spanish auto industry, the country’s largest exporter, of “a horizon of calm.”
At the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the measures taken by the Government to support the automotive sector during the fiscal year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our main production plants today," he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the car manufacturers to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry in the future, we can see a quiet horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry,” he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The head of government explained that these investments are intended both for the development of new models, as well as for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's actions to boost demand, in reference to the Plan 2000E, which will be applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the automobile manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows to reduce exhaust gases in the new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in approvals, which rose "by 40%" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start system of the engine, named i-Stop, in the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently available only for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out for its good marks in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its stress behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
Looking further at the unit, consisting of the dashboard and dashboard, one can see that Mazda is located with a variety of buttons and switches in the striking colors red and blue, along the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can drive comfortably.
All this comes with a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is currently only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-Stop with gasoline engine due to its great comfort in the gearbox and its low consumption , even if at Mazda especially the diesel models are the most sold.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the standard equipment stands out above all the assistant for the change of lane (RVM), which thus eliminates the dead angle, but also the operating elements for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors and the air-conditioning system.
In addition, this version also includes the Premium package, which contains for an additional 1,500 euros the following: in addition to other elements especially the learnable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD-loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not cover many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only downside to this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 euros for the tried-and-tested Sportive model.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving pass every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as they are sexy, shined more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is also limited, a device with which you can only read your emails without being able to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is still of particular interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very affordable flat rate, for example, only half the price of an iPhone flat rate.
After seeing the success with it, the company has launched two new devices: one designed only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free data service, quite unlike the peek at which you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data to read its emails once you have crossed the country border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with a hairdryer).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly tempting and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Across your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (although it’s always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it doesn’t have Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariff means that phone providers need to slowly but surely rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without vetrag and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you pay for it only once, namely when buying, and not month after month.
And that’s exactly what I also expect from FonPeek one day, a lifelong internet access purchase option that Peek already offers in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
When Barack Obama took office as president of the United States, she appeared in a dress and coat of that color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his, no doubt, second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: on top of the fact that it was almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric, and she wore something roughly embroidered or a necklace.
It goes so far that at first glance it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the time of her inauguration, she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet dress in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-height heels and the second time a noble model, but gold colors.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was raised as a hair crown on this occasion, the previous one she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fertility and Career of Women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between 15 and 75 years of age leaves no doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market limited by their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of profession they pursue.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-days or do not have a fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a fixed job, especially in the public sector, postpone the founding of a family and motherhood and therefore also have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed employment get their first child on average only 3.7 years after contracting, a figure that increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed employment, who have taken longer to achieve this and who have their contracting and the first child only realized much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a major impact on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of willingness to conceive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference could also be seen in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between the ages of 35 and 49, depending on whether they only have a primary school diploma or a higher education, became mothers for the first time with an average of 25.1 or 32.1 each.
There is also a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with major degrees get married before their first fixed-term employment and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do it exactly differently and first look for a fixed-term employment and then get married after that and then have their first child, notes Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The lead actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will become another famous hanger like before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion, they all appeared.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) to the three-legged X-ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
In doing so, he does not use a predictable and fear-inspiring genre (short biography, life and work), but instead seeks an affection for the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent spares neither horror nor enlightenment.
Moreover, that this book is a delicious pleasure to read, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
On reading his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the fateful fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any god.
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife that would almost have killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was fascinated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, therefore, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery are united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in going to heaven on the way of the vicegerent."
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was published in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. This is one of the 8000 summits in the world literature, you have to climb the north wall, the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a funny thing.
He sometimes said of himself that he would be the heir to a county estate owner and again he said that he would be the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore witness to a certain greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer picked up the insane cry, which was shouted out from a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that his echo would echo deep into the night of the 20th century in his own literary way. This he did on a journey on which he was fleeing the night before himself.
One day she knelt down and prayed, “My God, I beg you to do everything in your power so that I may finally stop writing like a woman.”
On his grave are engraved these verses of Spencer: 'Sleep after the effort,/ after the storm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life one finds pleasure in death.'
Virginia Wolf: “She always had her depressions in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on them among the azaleas or the birds were singing in Greek.
There is no other known case where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness.
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What else did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do than try to infuse Joyce into Baroja?
What was Benet's intention if he did not bring Baroja to Faulkner's arms?
What did Cela do besides destroy that man's fame so that he could put himself on that podium?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother went for a walk last week through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old ran up to her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we got from the zoo and that just weighs him six kilos, and then they passed out of the hotter sky.
Our indignation can not be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, because where the fun should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on the leash.
In addition to this, the choking attack that a woman who went for a leisurely walk got when she wanted to rebuke these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he will perhaps do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly man himself, or even with the truth.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been crying all day.
Of course, we have made a complaint in a nearby police station, but we still have great doubts about whether this will bring anything and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to clarify that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation at what has happened has prompted us to point out this incident.
We cannot understand what has to happen in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together to use the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “is far more than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming safer with each passing day,” and reiterated that it also helps with other educational and informational actions to get closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to more than 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, it is always committed to one of its main goals must be the development of increasingly safer products.
The sale of small trucks is growing again a bit
After almost two years, the car market for small vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6 % in relation to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac and Ganvam car dealers.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
However, it should be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all the vehicles that make up the small truck market: passenger cars, pick-ups, small vans, small vans and lighter small trucks / chassis.
Furthermore, there are still the same storm clouds in the sky, which are the ones that are most distressing to demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the bulk of sales goes to small and medium-sized companies, which in almost 100% of cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
For example, these constraints, which are the result of the turnaround of credit institutions, must be accompanied by other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
With this panorama and unlike passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a 2000E plan vehicle has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses have a right to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emissions not to exceed 160 grams per kilometer driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday again, Ganvam had reminded that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small loads as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Car Dealer Association predicted a similar year for 2010 to the one just past, for which it expects a sales failure (for passenger cars and off-road cars) of 19%.
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system back then and as is the case with the ESP stability control, the auxiliary braking systems for emergency braking have to become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly authorised passenger cars and light vans, with a waiting period until the end of February 2011 for the remaining vehicles.
The decision taken by the European Union is aimed at improving the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many on-road accidents because of their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects on the brake pedal on the basis of the braking force executed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - one expects that one in four accidents could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer is pointing out to the plan for more time.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the affected party gives its consent to each and every point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
However, GM is assured that it will make a decision regarding the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American automaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining increasing popularity.
If none of these buyers reach an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it 80 kilograms lighter, which now brings only 1,275 kilograms on the scale.
In order to create something like this, they firstly renounced the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a light curtain roof with manual drive 19, so that alone you have saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by the exclusion of the air-conditioning, you have re-installed a new one of the 54-parts of the engine, which has been re-built with the other one of the 64-
Then it was also due to the abandonment of the audio system CDR-30 again six kilos less and by the replacement of the door handles with handles made of fabric the missing kilo was reached.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller California highways, on mountain routes that were really very curvy.
In his driving behavior, you can only give him the note impeccably.
The reduction of his weight, however, has by no means led him to no longer be so safe on the stretcher.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not tried such a small and light model, which at the same time gives you a feeling of great safety in the corners, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at a low speed in the required time, until we give him the commands to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again...
He does everything you tell him. The car does everything we tell him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been extremely successful and can be increased with the 'sport' option as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
Acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether it’s getting out of the way or accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the highways on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already pretty damaged, but the car mastered the impact holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and this, although we found ice in the morning gray and roll split in the morning on some of these curves.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it is otherwise rather rare and there is much more to it than just a small improvement of the Boxster SS.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bust friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics clinic Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stiffness of her neck as her bags of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an outstanding triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes in first place within his group after the large appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was at the top of his ranking with eight triples.
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and teamwork, even though they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blues, who sat at the top of the scoreboard from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria were already coming out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from <0xC3><0x81>lava opted for an internal game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the "minus six" rating of Splitter already suggests that this would not be the best night of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was not decided yet and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of Elias" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellows" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with hit certainty to get air again and one of them was suddenly able to get the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas's end, ensured that the host was reassembled on the scoreboard with the goalkeeper's touchdown.
The Alaves were blown away in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they honestly deserved in the first three and a half minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson did not resign their team's best and tried to give their team strength again by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was put off the pitch due to fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to give up the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the domestic game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and possesses a lot of money.
Thanks to their first-quarter play, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts by 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the unicaja, although the native team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the scoreboard in the 13th minute was 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which it was almost equalled due to an action between the two Americans.
The Greek team began to finally get warm and his superiority on both halves of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-inflicted mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces at Unicaja.
Among their domestic players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A hunt was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which proved superior despite his 19 losses and even managed to compensate for the difference of the match played in M<0xC3><0xA1>laga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn brought the leadership within the group into a swing.
Unicaja tried to get away from the many failures and the departure of the injured Scotsman Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many drawbacks for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the suspension and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope came back to 66-57.
Still, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give up and resign the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now find out their salary, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, that they should earn due to their profile.
The "How Much Should You Earn?" tool calculates users' salaries based on more than 140,000 vacancies available at Trovit in Spain. Users are provided with a form on Facebook that allows them to enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Just a week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average "feels poorly paid," Trovit's product manager, Albert Ribera, explains in a press release.
The Spaniards are the lowest paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer gets a gross annual salary of 45,226 euros and a French 31,059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
Accordingly, a truck driver has a net annual salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with an annual net of 11,592 euros; followed by the work of a salesman with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest if his term of office officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the embassy in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, as his term expires on that day and he has to find a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled date: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged victorious), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
This, however, failed in Zelaya’s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician whom the “de facto” government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you so much!
After the most enticing days since last spring, when asset inflation was the predominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about a by nature uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to pay off debt by buying assets directly and indirectly freeing liquidity from interest, which moves around zero, in order to allow banks to buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are beginning to pour some sand into the gearbox, as the ECB has already predicted with its annual auction, which will take place next week.
That is why investors are questioning the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond differences are on the rise again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalize the private risks and the public debts are rising again.
The focus is now again on quality, and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the eurozone and Germany.
Spain has so far hardly been affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came along and threatened with a new downward revision regarding Spain's rating.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of moral risk, who once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for world economic policy for what they had caused, since they should have deprived themselves of the devastating effects, to which they had led to the limitation of new credits.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai suggests a tribal war between the Emirati to restore power in the Emirates, and development in Greece has been foreseen earlier.
A government that silences public debt, elections, and a new government that draws the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and S<0xC3><0xB3>crates in Portugal to Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin will save Hungary from defaulting on its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro member state to no longer comply with its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account the need for extraordinary measures in order to maintain the stability of government funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, facing an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some distortions to too high amounts, that would now be within the expected range.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same rate as European corporate bonds.
However, should the European differences decrease and the Spanish ones continue to increase, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
That of Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local biased indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, which again does not deal with a Japanese war scenario all the time.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment "caution while driving" is indicated.
Connected Branches
Iberdrola's chairman, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to appear in Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, where the strategy for Spain's energy supply is being debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n gave the press some highlights about what he had submitted to the Subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion euros from this date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020, the question will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the precondition of course by other "support energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy just passed by the government is in line with what his company has demanded, never wanted to say anything against this law, like creating incentives for national coal use, which would be the exact opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, we are clearly moving in this direction, despite some 'individual' measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called it.
Whatever the case, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions should be made right now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable compensation framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-handling services, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airport operator Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have yet been announced, is set for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of cooperation for the creation of an innovation center for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be the investigation of energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction involved is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the Public-Private Partnership Administration (PPP) decided to pursue the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll points administration.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly European construction companies, competing in the last phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best specialists in deep-sea construction.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is in charge of the infrastructure, and the French sub-group Bouygues, is against the Acciona team.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Bauderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction works and privatizations, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as you only get access through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the Leighton.
Millions of Assets
Acciona relies on this geographical area of utmost importance for the industry, in which it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies tasked with building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The subterranean toll route, which will be funded by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and will be called Northern Link (Northern Zubringer), has the purpose of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 kilometers through the tunnels in order to be able to connect the tunnels to each other.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll road is expected to open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is contributing $500 million ($308 million) to the funding.
Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia is awarding to Hochtief, which yesterday signed a contract with the government in the amount of 154 million, again and again considerable contracts.
ACS, through its local subsidiary Leighton, will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables.
This improvement will create a fast internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet begun and has received a high depth of 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investments amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC receives contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers long for a highway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the contract for the construction work to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
Construction work is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will take more than 32 months to complete.
Ms. Rushmore Receives Promotional Letter from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services to the agency Ms. Rushmore for the next two years over a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company announced.
This contract also allows for two 12-month extensions. Ms Rushmore was selected from among the 16 agencies that presented the competition, 4 of which came in the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom has been fined more than $63 million because of the competition’s slowdown.
France Télécom, the French competition regulator, has fined France Télécom <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for obstruction of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, since the competition watchdog believes that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and has therefore become retroactive again.
Application trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet to increase revenues from businesses that do not come from the telephone connection.
In principle, this website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It is necessary to wait until 2010 until these silks will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a 476.4 million since the beginning.
Since its creation in 1992, the Champions League has developed into a source of income for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken in 476.4 million since then, which brings them third and fifth place in the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income of the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money from its participation and the only one next to AC Milan to have won the trophy three times.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is fifth.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also earned the most money from their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And this, even though they lost to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only third in the countries that were able to earn money from the Champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, as opposed to four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution (disambiguation)
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated allocation procedure applied by UEFA.
In this fiscal year, the organization, which is chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million through the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a participation received 3.8 million through their blove presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and for a draw (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 per team). The clubs that came to the eighth final will each receive three million; the four that came to the quarterfinals will receive 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 places allocated.
The last year’s champion receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third-placed and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in soybeans
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday leaked details on the offer to buy shares, with which it wants to acquire a cap between 25 and 29.9% of Sos’ capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,5025 per share, paid out over ten years and at an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jeréz gives shareholders a 15-day period to communicate their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the authority.
If completed, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the sidelines of possible purchase offers and the legal disputes of his former managers, the brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as head of the internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is anything but free from controversy because the company is involved in a legal battle over the suspicion of diverting more than 230 million soybeans to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar loan, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the move of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves Paternina’s public exclusion bid submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.

New programmes for the assessment of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed into the workshops, where an appraiser must assess the damage and the cost of repair.
No single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes
That’s why almost 100% of reviewers use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for the evaluation of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are created with its products.
The other two companies that compete with the market for reviewing and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and motorizations came on the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car arrives on the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a cumbersome task, because each and every one of the over a thousand vehicle parts must be catalogized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphical image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold-out model, the work can be completed in a week, if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information in 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the fleet of vehicles running on the lanes, it is over 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out the documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight distributed centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the fault or residual value of a car.
The only company that provides information about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the AudaPlus products being a standard solution for assessing accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid for according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive for customers who rarely use it will be a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, each insurance company that produces thousands of reviews negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly line, only on the basis of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with vehicle windshields, and AudaSubastas is an online service that is open to the specialist market and can be used to offer vehicles that have been declared as total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, you can study how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes among others Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and provides the same way digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide for Testimonials is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
In the last three years, its turnover has increased by 20% annually and in 2008 it generated sales of 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they started to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in 1966 in Germany and established in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% is in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total worldwide sales of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amount to $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was valued at $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value enhancement, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchasing service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, assessors, car rental companies, workshops, scrap yards and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the site has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been cancelled may no longer drive on the lanes, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars of historical value may be re-registered, even if they have been checked out after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection to use it.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and after that the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for the working hours, surcharges or discounts and then he can print out the cost estimate and pass it on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a review tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to be able to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, because with it, for example, you can choose a door and then completely turn the image around to look at the inside.
