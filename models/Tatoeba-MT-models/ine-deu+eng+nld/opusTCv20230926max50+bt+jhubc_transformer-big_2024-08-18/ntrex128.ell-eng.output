Welsh MPs worry they'll be confused with 'mappets'
Some MEPs expressed concern over the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern has arisen in connection with the plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliamentary Assembly.
Members across the political spectrum are concerned that such a thing will sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party said his party was concerned that it would "come to an end with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "fool" and the word "pwp" means "debris".
A Plyde MP said the party as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his party was "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "mappet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drafting the bill to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any name by which Members will be called will, of course, be a matter for Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Parliament of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the appointment of Parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
As regards the title of MEPs, the Commission voted in favour of the name "Member of Parliament of Wales" or WMP, but the MWP option is the one that received more support during the public consultation.
MEPs are obviously proposing alternatives, but trying to reach consensus can be a difficult case for Parliament President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change the name within the next few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes to the way parliament works, including rules on deductions from the office of a member of parliament and the design of the committee system.
MEPs will decide in the final vote on the issue of their name during the debate on the legislation.
The citizens of Macedonia are coming to the polls for the referendum on the change of the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The people’s vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of its northern neighbour hides territorial sights and has repeatedly opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Giorgi Ivanov, the president of Macedonia, a fighter for the referendum on the name change, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change is simply the price they have to pay for their EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin are silent as the churches in Harlem disappear
“The older people I spoke to say there used to be a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
Today, there is nothing of the two.”
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
“The world is socializing in a different way today,” he said.
"The bars are no longer the 'salon' of the neighborhood where people frequent on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not hold as long as the officials hope, “and sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by mansions full of people who would not be willing to help the places of worship that have remained in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will hasten the day when all these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that all these people who will move to these apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built from white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist church resigned in the 1930s.
A church of blacks who were in close proximity took over the possession of the building.
The possession of the St. Martin building was taken over by a black church under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted the shops on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which they refused to hire or give.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners undertook the reconstruction and ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in the church of St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July described it in a different way: "a cultural treasure" and "a substitute instrument of historical importance".
The expert, Tiffany Inn of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first black musician in the world to play Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriweather said St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
What has happened in recent months in St. Martin is a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom have been hired by the church’s popular leaders, while others by the diocese.
The commissioners - the governing body of the parish, which consists of the pope's leaders - sent the bishop in July a letter about their concerns that the diocese "would seek to shift the cost" to the body of commissioners, despite the fact that it had no involvement in the recruitment of the authorities.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-Year-Old Shark Attacked in California for Lobster Diving
Shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster fishing in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Bik<0xC3><0xB3>n Beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of the child asking for help and approached paddling with a group to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just screams of excitement because he caught a lobster, but then he realized he was screaming, "Something bit me!
“Something bit me!”
His entire key had been unlocked," Hamel observed when he arrived at the place where the boy was.
"I've called on everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the sea!'" Hamel added.
The boy was airlifted to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The type of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Firefighter Larry Giles said in the press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was deemed not to belong to some dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had serious injuries to the upper part of the body.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Bis in Casablanca to Swamis in Encinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans put pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by placing cosmetic shelves corresponding to those of department stores, staffed with specialist staff.
In the context of the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn substantial rise in the UK cosmetics market, which continues to grow while clothing and household sales are declining, the largest cosmetics shelves will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country.
The investment in the cosmetics sector comes as supermarkets look for a way to replenish the space on the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees series will also be given more shelf space with the company's logo, similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is relaunching its own Boutique make-up range so that most products are vegan - something that is increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
In addition, the fragrance company The Fragrance Shop will try to make its products available at two Sainsbury's stores, one that opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the other in Shelley Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
E-shopping and the tendency to buy small amounts of food every day in local mini-markets means that supermarkets will have to make greater efforts to get people to visit them.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlet stores will look more and more like multi-stores as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services.
Sainsbury's put Argos outlet stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to renovate the departments of cosmetics and pharmacy ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute over how to distribute profits from pharmacies to the chain's supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
She said Lloyds will play its own role in the project, adding an expanded range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of our shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to provide advice.
The range of our companies has been designed to meet every need, while the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a strong destination for cosmetics that challenges the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones: Exasperated by Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Dragons Den series star Peter Jones is thrilled after telecaster Holly Willombie resigned from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle deal she owns in order to dedicate herself to her new contracts with Marks and Spencer ITV and the BBC.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the clothing and accessories company Truly.
Their business was likened to the company Goop of Guinness Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of “This Morning” announced on Instagram her decision to leave.
Hollywood made Dragons Den series star Peter Jones furious by stepping out of their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute in order to dedicate herself to her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became enraged when the golden girl on television admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new contracts, she would not have had enough time in Buckinghamshire.
The company has been likened to the Goop company of Guineth Paltrow and appears to have doubled Wilmington’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11m fortune.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his country houses.
According to one source: "Truly was far from Holly Willomby's top priorities.
It was about its long-term future, its source of revenue for the coming decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There's a warehouse full of products at the Marlowe headquarters ready to go for sale."
Experts estimate that the departure of the presenter of the show "This Morning", which is among the most commercial celebrities in Britain, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and clothing.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willombie, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been in close friendships with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
The couple spend their holidays together, and Jones retains a 40 percent stake in the Baldwin-based television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the central figure in M&S’s campaigns and replace Ad McPartlin in the presentation of the show “I’m A Celebrity” on ITV.
A source from Jones' close environment said last night, "We wouldn't want to comment on his professional affairs."
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for a comment that some would find unfit for a president, as well as his so positive stance toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said imitating the style of telecommuter.
"I didn't concede anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step toward de-nuclearizing North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ray Jong-ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "deaths" from North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“We are almost at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have built this excellent relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — ending missile tests, freeing the hostages, and returning the rest of the U.S. troops to their homes.
While he supported his unusual stance in statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have 'presidential' style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the hall because they couldn't get in, we would have only 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweeps an entire island, leaving thousands dead as they pass
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was announced that the assistance of foreign non-governmental organizations would not be needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lobok was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a necessary condition for the utilization of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is quite difficult," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign staff will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopos, a spokesman for the National Disaster Service, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute aid.
Given the earthquakes that often hit Indonesia, the country remains woefully unprepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, the same is not the case on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of an alarm siren for a tsunami in Palo, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
At best, the movement between the numerous islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters further complicate administrative care.
A floating hospital that had been parked in Lobok for the care of the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palou, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widdo had at the heart of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia’s disorganized infrastructure, and he had ample money to build roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding plagues Mr. Joko’s administration before re-election next year.
Joko is also under pressure from persistent fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets, using knives, bows and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.
Watch: Daniel Stairs of Liverpool equalises against Chelsea <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Daniel Sturges saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Steritz took a pass from Serdan Sakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's end with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball on his left and hit the back beam.
His effort was driven very high from the large area and ended up right up in the nets.
The ball eventually fell over Kepa Arizabalaga who jumped to repel it and entered the nets.
"I was trying to take this position, to get to the ball and players like Shakiri always play as much forward as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Strice told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cande approaching, I made a direct change, I didn't think about it much and I did the shot."
Chelsea had the lead 1-0 in the half after the goal in the 25th minute from the Belgian star Edin Azar.
The blue striker gave a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before giving a heel shot near the center of the pitch and running to the side of Liverpool.
Kovacic did the one-two in the center of the pitch.
He then gave a deep blow, leading Azar to the great area.
Azar ran ahead of the defender and finished by sending the ball into the nets on the back beam with a left-handed shot in front of Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will compete against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia stands at 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia stands at 832, according to the country’s natural disaster service, early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-degree earthquake that hit the area on Friday and created 6-metre-high waves, the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purouo Nugroho, told a news conference.
The city of Palou, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the debris of the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Suspect After Murdering Woman With A Knife
A murder investigation began after the discovery of the body of a woman in Birkenhead, Mercyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds in Grayson Mouse on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police asked the resident who saw or heard something to report it to the police.
"The investigation is at an initial stage, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the neighborhood around John Street and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us," he said.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in the footage from the dashcams to contact us as they may have in their possession information that is vital to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they may know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway as police said they are in the process of informing the closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Moose, in an attempt to return to his apartment, was informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The tenants were informed that it may take hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer is alleged to have told a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared with tears on the scene.
He kept saying, "It's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the police tape and one outside.
Officers were standing outside the tape and were watching the apartment building.
Anyone with any information is kindly requested to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 for case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the "rewrite of history" controversy
His exorcism would be poetic justice for the Tallimbanist destruction of England’s numerous cultural and religious works by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the present discussion of removing the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's form would not be targeted outside the Palaces of Westminster.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not dictated or executed by Cromwell.
Possibly, a mistaken member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestor in the previous century.
Cromwell’s outstanding portrayal by Sir William Hamo Thornicroft is characteristic of his 19th-century image and part of the historiography of a personality many believe to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether this is an absolutely accurate assumption is the subject of an open historical debate.
All that is certain is that the conflicts in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable personality who represents one side of the divide.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also commendable and memorable.”
Swine Killer Injures Deadly Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, only known by the name "Wan", was found with a severed artery in a blood lake near a pig farm in the Liupansui market in Guizhou province, South China's Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farm worker is preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xinjiang, China.
He is said to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a neighboring pig farm open.
He stated that in the pighouse there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
The examiner’s examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kilograms had fatally injured the farmer, according to his report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and swollen," said the cousin, known by his surname "Wu", according to the evening news bulletin of Guyang.
The security camera footage shows Wang entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Wang or his cousin.
A market official said in the evening news that the pig had been placed in a cage so as not to attack anyone else, while police collected the evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wang's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating some compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 295-pound pig threw a farmer in Wales on his tractor until the farmer’s wife scared the animal to get away.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was strewn by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “needle.”
“They’re just in a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We just have to show them the proper respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are about to bring extensive rainfall to the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest water masses of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring catastrophic rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Hurricane Rosa's wind strength reached 85 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure wind region has begun to form above the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the peninsula's low-lying California coast on Monday, a tropical storm will ripple
Hurricane Rosa will bring 25 inches of rain to areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching low wind-pressure area will create extensive heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rains of 2.5 to 10 centimeters will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates approaching 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour locally, particularly in parts of Southern Nevada and Arizona.
Storms of 5 to 10 inches are expected locally in the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of the phenomena due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is recommended to avoid any walking in the desert in the face of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can turn the gorges into rushing rivers, and storms will cause local winds and sandstorms.
The low wind pressure area will create some locally strong rainfall at sites on the southern California coastline.
A total rainfall of more than 1 inch is possible, which can cause small flows of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical bores will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early in the morning on Monday, before the phenomena spread out late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Fore Corners area on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be some sharp temperature changes across the U.S. as temperatures in the Arctic fall, but in the tropical zones they remain quite high.
Sometimes, this fact leads to very intense temperature changes at close ranges.
A typical example of the sharp temperature differences between the central U.S. was observed on Sunday.
A difference of nearly 10 degrees was noted between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent high summer temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern U.S., October is expected to start with high temperatures at 27°C from the eastern plains to parts of the southeast.
The temperature in New York City can reach 27°C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above the average.
According to our long-term forecast for the weather, there is a good chance that above-average temperatures will be observed in the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million TV viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition.
More than 20 million viewers watched the captivating testimony of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault, which allegedly took place on Friday in the late 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with television networks disrupting the normal flow of the program to topple the last minute on Friday: the agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Fleck to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that at a party while she was high school students, Kavanaugh attacked her while she was drunk and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in a charged statement, said he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
According to Nielsen’s measurements, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers attended the hearing on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
The numbers were not immediately made available to other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While also, Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of viewers watching a broadcast from office spaces.
To see this TV show in its proper dimensions, it is a common analogous size to that of watching a football game of the playoffs or the Oscars award ceremony.
The Fox News channel, whose journalists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, preceded it with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS followed with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million, and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Fleck turned out to be the protagonist in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican said he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded early Friday morning protesters disapproving of him as he was trying to get into the elevator for a hearing by the Senate Justice Committee.
He stood staring low for several minutes as he was disapproved, live on TV on CNN.
"I stand here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth in this country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Fleck said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would have more to say at the Commission hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were covered live a few hours later, the Senate Judiciary Committee vote on the promotion of Kavanaugh's candidacy in the Senate plenary for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, which was requested by a minority of Democrats.
Fleck was partly persuaded by discussions with his friend, Democratic Party Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Koons and some other Senators, Fleck then made a decision.
Fleck's choice was valid, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not gather votes for Kavanaugh's approval without conducting an investigation.
President Trump has asked the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of plans to leave the European Union of playing "political games" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party’s Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview along with her own on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson strongly criticized the Chequers Brexit plan, saying that the proposal to levy tariffs between Britain and the EU was "completely unreasonable".
Wade Simms Shooting: Police Arrested Suspect Dataon Simpson for Murdering LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old player from the LSU basketball team.
Dataon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is being held in prison on second-degree murder charges, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have in their hands a video of Sims's clash with Simpson and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police tracked down the glasses at the crime scene and said they tracked down traces of Simpson's DNA, according to the WAFB, which works with CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said they admitted that he had fatally injured Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to a preliminary report by Eastern medical examiner Baton Rouge released on Friday, the cause of death is a bullet wound to the head and neck.
The ministry has put at the disposal of the Louisiana Police Special Task Force, the police forensic laboratory, the police forces of the Southern University and the citizens of the region to assist in the investigation for arrest.
LSU sports director Joey Allebev thanked the local law enforcement authorities for the "scientific investigation and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-high Forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "in a state of shock" since Wade's death.
“We’re always worried about incidents like this,” Wade said.
Volcanic ash emissions in the city of Mexico
Volcanic ash emissions from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned residents of Mexico on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after activity on the crater reached its peak, recording 183 emissions of gas and ash over a 24-hour period.
The Center was monitoring various indications and small seismic vibrations.
Images on social media show car windshields covered with thin layers of ash in Mexico City’s neighborhoods like Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since the 7.1-magnitude quake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with the class-restoration units as thousands took part in protests for the first anniversary of the vote on Catalonia’s breakup that triggered a polarization.
A group of pro-independence masked demonstrators, held back by the class-restoration units, threw eggs and paint into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists.
Complications also occurred later in the day with policemen using their clubs to suppress the conflicts.
For hours, groups of supporters of Catalonia's independence shouted the slogan "We do not forgive, we do not forget" against groups of protesters in favor of the unity of the country who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized with minor injuries that occurred during the demonstrations, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the region that supports independence a year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, but it is being celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The overwhelming majority of voters opted for independence, although the turnout was low with those opposing the independence to boycott the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year, following an attempt by police authorities to stop voting in polling stations in the area where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police force.
The demonstration took place but was forced to take a different turn.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in pro-independence protests with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia’s prospects of winning its independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy who managed to vote, but now the situation is stagnant," he said.
Despite the fact that they scored a vital victory, although limited in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties in favor of independence struggled to maintain their momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders being forced to self-deportation or find independence.
Joan Poutz, a 42-year-old engineer who recorded the protests in support of the police on his cell phone, said the clashes were fueled by politicians from both camps.
“Intensity is escalating more and more,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunceras, one of nine Catalan leaders who were in pre-trial detention last year, announced his candidacy for the European elections next year.
"My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to denounce the suppression of democratic values and the repression that we have received from the Spanish government," he said.
London: Man Arrested After Car Crash at Home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeated car crashes at a residence in London.
The incident took place in Bolinagard Crested on Thursday at approximately 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
There may have been a shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's strike gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston secured the win.
The forward Livingston stunned the Rangers by giving Steven Gerard just his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox group.
Dolly Menga's hit made a difference as Gary Holt's side changed level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains undefeated in the championship this season and faces the Harts, who have the lead by eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to this match, the Rangers are hosting Rappid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, continues its unbeaten race in six games in its class, with head coach Holt not having tasted any defeat yet since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunity in the face of visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before scoring, with its immediacy bringing the Rangers into a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took the lead and was close to reaching just before the finish, but Alan Lithgow thwarted his attempt by slipping Craig Hulkett's head off the finish line.
The homers willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could force visitors into free kicks and corners.
And that’s how the important goal came.
The Rangers could not prevent a free kick and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to send the ball to Menga, who took the pass and scored from the center of the area.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball but found the defending champions impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos knocked the ball out of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was repelled by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's feet and Lithgow's pass was released in another free kick at Livingston.
Many vertical passes were made in the Livingston area and were constantly rejected, while two penalties were requested - after Hulkett's claim of the ball against substitute player Glenn Middleton and one for hand - which were rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingston - analysis
Alastair Lamont of the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Spectacular performance and results for Livingston.
All of them, without exception, were excellent, exceeding their expectations on this upward course.
Their style of play and personality changed little after they returned to top form, but credit should also be given to Holt for the impetus he gave to the team upon his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halket was excellent, enlisting a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Warell on alert throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, were not inspired.
As good as they were in the past under Gerard's guidance, they did not meet these standards.
Their last game was incomplete - only once they managed to pass the defense of the hosts and this is a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed emotions at Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s reception in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the heads of state of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had come to a rift over issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest community of Turks outside Turkey.
Police blocked the gathering of the crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president from close quarters.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them of Kurdish origin - also gave the gift, condemning both Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The division of the demonstrators reflects the controversial nature of a visitor who is treated by some Turkish Germans as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Road accident in Detford: death of a cyclist after a collision with a car
A biker lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Detford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The collision occurred a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and left a cyclist, who lost his life on Chillers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities were making efforts to identify the man and inform their closest relatives of the man's death.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been diverted, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jails: Six Police Officers Injured in Conflict
Six police officers were injured in riots that erupted in high-security men's prisons, according to statements from the prison's Directorate of Prisons.
Storms erupted at His Majesty Long Lartin prisons in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still in progress.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been recruited to deal with the riots, in which eight detainees are involved and which took place in one wing.
The police were hospitalized with micro-injuries to the face during the clashes.
A spokesman for the prisons said: “Specially trained personnel took over to deal with the incident in the prisons of His Majesty Long Lartin.
Six staff members were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may face a greater penalty.”
In the prisons of His Majesty Long Lartin are more than 500 detainees, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, the administration of the prisons was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October of last year, class rehab units were called to prison to suppress serious incidents that erupted, during which staff members were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical recession to hit Arizona, but that’s likely to happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwestern parts of the desert, bringing floods to their brink.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued emergency flood warning bulletins for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Forestry.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass just above Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm or low-barometric state less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with individual rainfall volumes of up to 6 inches, in Mogglen Rim, Arizona.
In other parts of the Southwestern states, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, it is likely that there will be 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, with the possibility of individual total rainfall volumes of up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain that Rosa brings can be a blessing, as the area is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwestern states are currently experiencing drought conditions.
“According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought,” the report said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the hurricane, on Sunday morning Rosa will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour and will move north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive ashore in Mexico with tropical storm intensity in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Heavy rainfall may occur in areas of Mexico, which will pose a significant risk of flooding.
“Total rainfall volumes of about 3 to 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora are expected, which is likely to reach up to 10 inches,” according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and will arrive at the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low barometer, which will then pass through Arizona to reach the southern tip of the Yuca.
"The main danger expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is the very heavy rainfall in Baha California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern U.S. states," the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous intense flooding and mudslides in the deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack on Minchomer Northon: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found to have suffered knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Beast area of Minnesota, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in "steady" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are urging anyone who may have recorded in a video on his mobile phone to present what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh "lived the evil and the anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "lived the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of his nomination as a candidate.
Kavanaugh testified in Congress on Thursday, blatantly and with apparent emotion denying Christine Blaisey Ford's claims that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified in front of a court on her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the greatness, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm the candidacy of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent track record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"We have five weeks left from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but it’s actually like I am,” he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting outstanding candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place by Friday, a senior deputy head of the Republican Party's leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were dragged by giant waves sweeping the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palo on Friday, when six-metre-high waves hit the shore at dusk, luring many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 Richter earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, so they were hit by it," Sutopo Purgoo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management service BNPB, said in a statement.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it pulled cars, wood, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster management service show many damaged buildings and shops, bridges that have been ripped and collapsed, and a crater surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The quakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Assessment and Technology Application Service (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
He said heaps of victims were found trapped under the wreckage of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage are likely to be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palo, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the center of the quake.
The communication systems "completely paralyzed and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy and it could get even worse,” he said.
Widespread criticism was made at the Service on Saturday because it did not inform that a tsunami had struck Palou, although officials said the waves had reached the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard screaming panicky trying to warn people down the road about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, dragging homes and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which also disrupted communications in the wider area of Palo, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by authorities.
The army began sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the displaced still desperately need food and other basic basic necessities.
The city’s airport reopened only to help with relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widdo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Dongala managed to safely reach the city of Palou, where workers found shelter in shelters from tarpaulins set up in the backyard of their office, they passed through scenes of destruction on their way, Mr. Joseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of damaged houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief teams took on the sad task of starting the process of relieving the injured, some complained that foreign, particularly experienced workers in the field of aid were not allowed to travel to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of financing, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the site of a disaster is declared a zone of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says it is a national disaster, we can request international assistance, but there is no decision yet.”
As the second day after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday passed in Palou, the friends and family of those still missing still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less gloomy.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days, next to her mother’s dead body.
Ghent Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national parachuting team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Madaji, were his students.
“As the oldest in the parachuting sport, I have my own emotional load,” he said.
Mr. Ghenton recounted how, when news broke of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the downhill community, he began sending desperate WhatsApp messages to his rivals in Palou who participated in the beach festival.
However, the sign next to his messages was a gray "n" symbol, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while supplying an automatic pickup machine in Newport on the Levy.
On Friday morning, thieves seized $26,750 from a Brink employee who was supplying an ATM machine to Newport on the Levy, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had evacuated an ATM machine to the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “came running after Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leaving the spot, according to the statement, but police did not determine the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Jee
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Jee.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creature that is officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been listening to the avid Son for a long time, and used this alias as a title on his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album titled Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the business name he uses today, West had previously stated that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think the word 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West said earlier this year in a discussion on the title of his album with radio producer Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, I'm us.
My name changes from Kanye, which means "the only one", to Je, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused self, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, ZEI-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without spelling and capital letters.
Mexico's President-elect vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student repression.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China is more active in the artificial intelligence field, the U.S. will have to double the amount it spends on research in this field, says AI investor Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Apple and Microsoft.
This comment comes in addition to announcements from various parts of the U.S. government on artificial intelligence, as the U.S. does not have a formal artificial intelligence strategy overall.
China, meanwhile, last year unveiled its plan to become the world’s first innovation country in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, as all other countries are so far behind the US and we seek to make the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence taking place in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book titled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order of Things) is published this month by the Houghton editions.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the best American player Otello, and later was a Microsoft Research executive and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee recognized the importance of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Service (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would be held to identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to receive government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that gets the best out of the academic space, it’s the companies,” he said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired authorities from universities to work on artificial intelligence issues in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that a green card should be automatically offered to holders of a PhD in Artificial Intelligence,” he said.
The State Council of China adopted a Plan for the Development of Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, respectively, are distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of the academic work in China is poor.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, to which partners from the business and academia will join, and the White House announced the formation of an Elective Committee on Technology.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in months in U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Citizens of Macedonia hold a referendum to decide whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia participated in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would be renamed "North Macedonian Republic", a move that would spark a decades-long disagreement with Greece that had blocked the country's candidacy for accession to the European Union.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not take part in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the turnout would reach the 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: “You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece.”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to seek membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the conflict.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will make our lives safer," said Oliva Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several members of parliament have stated that they will comply with the result of the vote so that it becomes final.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The state election committee said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout reached just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, so it gave the present 66 percent of registered voters.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoraf Zaev, his wife Zorika and son Dusko voted in the referendum on the change of the name of the country that would pave the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union 30
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and places chairs in front of scenes that have been erected by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up high, not as second-class partners," Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said a positive outcome would be “the confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, i.e. lower than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its rise to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero passes through Brighton’s entire defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling formed Brighton's defense by winning 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed himself to score easily in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got all the way in the middle of the pitch at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three Brighton defenders before he spilled out into the open.
Afterwards, Aguero was found surrounded by four green players.
He dripped past the one defender, then escaping from several others at the edge of the Greater Brighton area.
Then, he went all the way to his left, finding Sterling.
The English forward made his first move in the area by returning the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, scoring on the right side of the nets.
"Aguero is facing some problems at his feet," City's coach, Pep Guardiola, told reporters.
"We told him to play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the battle of the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep in the Brighton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Liroi Sane.
Sane held the ball in his possession and guided Sterling to the back beam.
The blue forward kicked the ball into the nets just before he got out.
City faces Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to beat the Rockies.
As the Nationals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the ever-competitive Sherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still impacts for the Rockies in the playoffs as they lead against a Los Angeles Dodgers game in the National League West.
The Rockies have gone into the playoffs with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock the top spot in their category.
"Although we have nothing to gain, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will probably be a game of the highest level I will face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to fight in such a fight?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the original pitcher on Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let S<0xC3><0xB8>rzer throw the ball.
Serger, who will make his 34th start, made practice throws on Thursday and will play on Sunday, which is normally a rest day for him.
The right-hander from Washington has a performance of 18-7 with an average earning points (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 outs due to strikes in 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trump delivers speech in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The President referred indirectly to the situation regarding his chosen candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in his speech on the importance of the participation of Republicans in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important electoral processes in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but it’s actually like I am, and that’s why I travel everywhere to support outstanding candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this miserable, miserable radical group of Democrats, you see what’s going on right now.
And they are determined to take back power by any means necessary. You see the evil, the misery.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to exterminate to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have taken on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
"And you've been seeing this for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and evil, miserable and liars."
He was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, a report that was accepted with strong public disapproval.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you reveal the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, oh no, I'm waiting for an answer. This was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen"
The Labour Party is no longer a broad faction.
He is not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
I was not surprised at all that activists of the Momentum movement in my local group voted to insult me.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs to whom they have been told they are not welcome, precisely because we are saying our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, had a similar approach, because she strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for arguing with Jeremy Corbyn in the motion for repudiation.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, strangely, for issues similar to those on which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the meeting of the Workers of the Nottingham East on Friday stated that "we want our meetings to be productive with the participation of all".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, today is not that tone of many meetings and the promise of a “more compassionate, more compassionate” policy has long been forgotten if it ever really began to be implemented.
It is increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously considered that we had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and adopt EU views that I would never agree with, whether they were about national security or not.
Every time I spoke in public, no matter what I was actually saying, I heard a buzz on social media, where some people were calling for my rejection, they denounced the center’s policy and told me I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my other colleagues, as the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a flurry of sexist or racist insults every day, but they never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how insults are now considered regularity.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance. . . .
The reality is that we are no longer a broad faction and that with every proposal of denial or change of the rules of choice, the party’s boundaries narrow.
I have been advised many times over the last two years not to raise my voice, not to talk too much and that "everything will be okay".
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student still, due to the neglect shown by the Thatcher government which literally led to the failure of my entire class, my purpose has been to defend better public services for those who need them most, either as a member of the government.
I never hid my politics, and I did the same in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East could have been confused in any way as to my political views and points of disagreement with today’s leadership.
To those who put forward the objection on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is facing a Brexit that will hurt our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, really, my only message is not to the members of the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that it is not a threat of rejection or political expediency.

Ir - Melrose: 38 - 17: The invincible Ir climbs to the top
Two delayed goals may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there’s no doubt that Ir deserved to triumph in this highly entertaining today’s Tendent Championship match.
He is now at the top of the ranking, the only undefeated team out of the ten.
Ultimately, it was her superior defense, as well as the best use of opportunities, that lifted the scales in favor of the hosts and coach Peter Murtsi had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Ire, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, with the conversion of Fraser Climo, brought Air forward, but a yellow card to Scotsman Rory Hughes, who was released for a playoff by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to eject.
Climo increased Ir’s lead with a penalty, before scoring, right in the middle, a goal with a conversion, leading Ir to the locker room with a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, with Baggot's conversion, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury to Rouarid Not, who was removed by a carrier, and, after rebooting, Air further increased the gap by a goal from Stafford McDowell, with the conversion of Climo.
Deputy leader Blair McPherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of Bruce Colvin's non-converting numerical advantage after a period of intense pressure.
The homers came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow taklin card to Climb without the ball from the penalty line, McPherson scored a goal in the back of the attack that Air fired.
Climate made a conversion, as it did almost again since the restart, after first Kylie Rowe picked up David Armstrong's kick and sent the extreme Gregor Henry away for the fifth goal of the hosts.
The protagonist of Still Game starts a new career in the focus
Still-Game series star Ford Kiernan appears ready to jump into the catering industry after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and in which he co-stars with his longtime partner in the comedy Greg Hebphil.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth round will also be the last of the show and it seems that Kieran is planning his life after Geygland.
According to the official registers, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to deal with the "blossoming food industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the fully-equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, blue flags are waving.
On the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is written the slogan: "Our sea is rightfully ours.
It’s our job to get her back.”
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that Chile conquered after a bloody conflict over the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing of its people to travel.
These hopes have risen today more than ever, for decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice’s ruling on October 1 after five years of consultation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course expects the result with a positive eye,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice’s ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim to have a court in Chile, after decades of turbulent talks, to negotiate.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is waging a controversial battle for re-election next year, has much to gain or lose from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia and that, even if it did, they would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to give away Chilean lands and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling is due to be issued just six months after the submission of the final arguments suggests that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of furthering Bolivia’s goals, the past four years may have undermined them.
“Today’s Bolivian government has raised the issue of access to the sea,” Zarate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has exhausted any remaining good mood in Chile, he argued.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velje, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end 139-year disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular leaders, is using the issue of going to the sea as a political crusade.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can’t trust Washington.
Mr. Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the leaders of the two states.
Ri made those comments while U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears ready to restart nuclear diplomacy that had reached a stalemate three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri says the view that ongoing sanctions and the U.S.’s refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will eventually force the North to “knee” is a summer night’s dream.
Washington is reluctant to agree to a declaration if Pyongyang does not first make significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit to take place.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is seriously considering renouncing an arsenal that the country considers likely to be the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available in a store near you
If you want to grow the collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented on the catwalk a series of bizarre oversized hats for their Spring-Summer 2019 collection that stole the show at Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely awkward hats pervaded Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to the catwalk.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was an overly beige hat decorated with a wide boar with wings that completely covered the heads of the models.
Among other oversized accessories were watermelons decorated with stones, a magic hat, even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than to high fashion sewing.
One creation brought to mind complete diving equipment with a ventilator and glasses, while another one looked like melted ice cream on a jug.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you are in luck.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach central shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after the "La Bomba", the saddle hat with the too wide boar we have seen wearing so many, from Riana to Emily Rataikovski.
The popular brand that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that covered the social media sent yet another great creation to the catwalk, a beach bag almost as big as the model who wears it wearing his swimsuit.
The dark orange shelving bag, decorated with roses from shelves and a white leather handle, was the piece that stood out from the Spring-Summer 2019 La Riviera collection by Jacquemus at Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and big beach bags in stores next summer, as the designer made such a big impression that it would be hard to ignore the demand for them."
John Edwards: Language Skills are Necessary for the Citizens of the World
Scotland’s independent schools have a history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with yet another series of outstanding exam results, which were only further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community approaches.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, which are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to students and their parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher educational levels, the professional career they will choose, and their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational field that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable course of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language they understand, then what you say comes into their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say comes into his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s exams, we find that languages are at the top of the scoreboards, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a bachelor’s degree of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A-degree in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who did not.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages today, as a course of choice, are considered as important as courses related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Skills Committee found that, in terms of the reasons why employers struggled to fill vacancies, a 17 per cent share was due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, the need to acquire language skills is becoming increasingly urgent, so that young people are prepared for their future professional careers.
Since more future employment opportunities require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future, due to this skill that you will be able to use throughout your life.
If one is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to make a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investing in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be some languages to choose from in independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
There is no denying today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and excellence for Scotland’s youth.
They have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Councils of Independent Schools of Scotland.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The anticipation of fans eager to see LeBron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers has almost come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the first game ahead of the Denver Nuggets season in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the six-game schedule that the Lakers had to give before the racing season.
“I don’t need prep races at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Trump's Concentration in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of rallies starting in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump gatherings next week, which includes tours to friendly neighboring areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his choice for the Supreme Court pending, Trump seeks to bolster popular support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress by voting in the No.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week’s hearings for the Supreme Court’s candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, which took place in a tense atmosphere due to allegations of sexual misconduct, and he has a confirmation vote on the matter.
However, the primary goal of this series of gatherings is to help Republicans facing ambiguous results in the November elections in order to gain some momentum.
So, President Trump's campaign officials said that these five gatherings next week are aimed at "mobilizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and extend the Reuters majority that they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"Congressional control is so critical to his agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible as we go into the busy period of the campaign," a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
The rally scheduled for tonight at Willing's Wesbanco Arena could bring back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who is down in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come and try to give him a boost to the ballot box," Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the courage to fight by keeping hopes alive as it travels to Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon’s fours might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging suspension of the momentum is a completely invented sporting idea, but the players believe it deeply, and especially in such matches.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
“It was six points ahead and now it’s four, so we’re probably having a little momentum,” Spith said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, to lead by four points and to remain twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spith says, feel the “air in their blankets” and have a lot to encourage them, like the twin Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spith was deadly from tee to green and sets the example.
The voices of the celebrations became louder as he continued his lap, making a critical hit to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The blow they won the game in the 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations that show his belief that the American team is not out.
“You have to look deep inside and worry about your own game,” Spith said.
It's what every player has left behind.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more points than Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but adorable twin has hit four out of four, and it doesn’t seem to do anything wrong.
The "Mollywood" were the only pair that did not hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way in which the energy seems to flow to and from the noisy viewers, seals the fact that it is the players who are going to have to win on Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flitwood or Molinari to seal off a possible European victory while Le Golf is on the way.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory is still premature.
Baba Watson and Webb Simpson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front nine they stabbed the Spaniard and the Swede so deep into a hole they couldn’t get out of it.
But on Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting races to watch them closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played best as a team so far and has a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome match has also shown that the US team has the guts, despite the doubts of some.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after its lead in Saturday’s fourball and foursome with 10-6 against the US.
The inspiring twin of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari made a two-win draw against a struggling Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead at Le Golf National so far at four points.
The European side of Thomas Björn, trying to keep the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American side in the morning fourball, with a 3-1 series.
The U.S. resisted the foursome more, winning two games, but could not cover the difference.
Jim Furick’s side needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a series, while along with Molynari, also known as "Molywood", after a shocking first weekend, he is only the second-twin to win four.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reid in the fourball, they joined forces to defeat a tired Woods and American newcomer Bryan DeSambo with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who was dragged into both games on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning fourball, returned to Henryk Stanson's teammate for the foursomes with 2&1 defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, taking first and third place in the world rankings.
Not everything went well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 win over John Ram and Ian Paulter of Spain in the fourball and later returned to beat Paulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome while losing the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team been able to recover while losing four points in the singles, although because he is the keeper, Furik is enough to reach a tie to maintain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their means.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without confidence-building measures
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepened a sense of distrust toward the United States and that his country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Health Organization's annual general meeting that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, e.g. nuclear and ballistic missile testing, nuclear decommissioning, and non-nuclear testing facilities.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions, there is no way to unilaterally begin our disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated well-known complaints by North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "stage" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would not be rewarded as it progressed in the process, his statement was as important as possible.
Rice referred to Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump's public statement at the first summit held between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work for the U.S.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first “deliver” its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the easing of harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘nuclearization first’ and increases pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve their goal by blackmailing, putting obstacles even in the ‘statement of end to war,’” he said.
“The notion that sanctions can kneel is a dream of those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ree made no mention of a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, noted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the partner in the issue of denuclearization was a foreigner in South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the country would not happen.
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. inland with North Korea's ballistic missiles was inevitable because "Bad President" Trump called the tone "self-evident."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, lauded Kim for his courage to move forward with disarmament measures, but vowed that much more must be done and sanctions must remain in place.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for it, saying "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it's okay."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and uninterruptedly until full, final and confirmed de-nuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to neutralize funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, to be denounced by North Korea a few hours later that he had "the demands of a gangster."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to defuse a missile facility and also a nuclear complex, if the United States took "corresponding measures."
He clarified that Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he seeks were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and promote the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Are Taking Lessons on How to Get Enough Rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University seeks all undergraduate students to sleep longer in an effort to combat the growing crowded culture of all-night study by consuming too much caffeine.
One academic found that students at the number 1 university in the world often do not know basic things, such as how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the class after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
In the end, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I learning about this just now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to include the course in the week when it was found that students were deprived.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is the image of a student dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as how sports performance is influenced by the sport.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behaviour of the students.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke,” added Professor Cheisler.
The culture of being proud of yourself because you studied all night long still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a problem that swells.
Sufficient sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of starvation, resulting in a drowsiness.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Cheisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a lesson across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program before starting their studies at this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chysler recommended students to set an alert for when they should go to bed, as well as an alarm clock for waking time, and to be aware of the harmful consequences of driving the "blue light" problem in the junction emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga sets goals for Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered yet another sad off-season defeat as Dolly Menga's shot led Steven Gerard's disco-led side to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's team sought to score their first out-of-home win since the February 4–1 win at St. John's, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerald's only second defeat in 18 games as head coach, leaving the team eight points behind.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' inspiring roster seemed incapable of rebounding.
While Rangers is now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, with just one goal difference from the previous Hibernian.
And the Rangers may be in further trouble, as Superintendent Callum Spence needed to receive first aid for a head injury caused by an object thrown from the stage.
Gerard made eight changes to the team's composition and defeated Aye in the semi-finals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition "Live 11" that he got a degree from Harts last week and would be happy with how this well-heeled machine was able to stifle every effort of his opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Menga's first long pass sent Scott Pitman into Alan McGregor's area, but the average didn't find the ball.
A deep free kick by King Jacobs found Chief Craig Hulkett, but his teammate's defender Alan Lithgow was all he could do was send the ball away from the beam.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith for the game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed he should have won a penalty in the 15' as he clashed with Steven Lawles, but referee Steven Thompson ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers had only two shots within the area in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not worry at all about Lasana Kulibali's head and Ovi Ejaria's low-key shot.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the match, Livy was clearly below expectations, no one can deny that she deserved the victory for the effort alone.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and found Menga who simply completed the effort.
Gerard made changes in the half-time by pulling Kuliballi out and putting Ryan Kent in. The change paid off almost immediately, as the extreme passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to lure guests into the style of the game she knows and enjoys, with Lithgow and Hulkett moving away one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have increased the gap towards the end, but McGregor faced Jacobs straight, stopping him before Lithgow's attempt from the corner.
Rangers' deputy Glenn Middleton had another phase for a penalty kick to the end, as he clashed with Jacobs, but again Thompson ignored it.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Meter
A page from the almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: as today, 136 years ago and Vale ... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. This invention eventually led to the device that is now known as the Geiger meter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has moved into the sphere of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to detect radioactive metal elements, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of the atoms caused by the radiation in the metal elements.”
Evans: "Look, it's crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears its name continues its work.

Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Problem Cells in Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
They can “see” a protein that is common in various types of cancer and then be re-injected
A vaccine under test shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize problem cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they "see" a protein common in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzovsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands.”
As Professor Berzovsky explained, the HER2 protein “is the driving force for the development of several types of cancer,” such as breast, ovarian, lung and large intestine cancer.
A similar approach in which immune cells are extracted from patients and then "taught" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West defended Trump, wearing a hat with the slogan MAGA, after his appearance on the SNL.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was disapproved at the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an outlandish interview in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in the 2020 election.
After presenting his third song for the evening, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a baseball hat with the slogan Make America Great Again, he gave a riddle against the Democrats and reiterated his support.
“I often talk to a white guy and he says, ‘But how do you like Trump?
If I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL opened with a sketch featuring Matt Damon, with the Hollywood star disrupting Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blue Ford's allegations of sexual assault.
Although it wasn’t broadcast, the video of West’s delirium was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to annoy West with this post.
West also protested to the public that he was not treated well in the background because of his hat.
“I was bullied in the background.
They said, "Don't go out with your hat."
I've been bullied!
And they say I don't know what's going on with me," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "I don't know what happens to me. I'm going to wear the superman's cape, because so no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
“Try the love.”
His comments were disapproved at least twice by the public and SNL contributors appeared to be in a difficult position, Variety reported, with one person saying in the magazine: "The whole studio was in mortal silence."
West was called in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused several when he sang I Love It dressed up as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by Kant Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU WHO RESISTED TO OCLO".
However, the show’s host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just “his self and that’s great.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (buying their music or clothes or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe endorses and extols an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Didi.
The rapper Snoop Dogg had changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course the music legend Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Attempted murder for the knife-wielding attack on a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a knife attack on a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakamor, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor denounces the stereotype of the hero mob, saying that such on-screen roles pass the message to the little boys that they must be tough to win the respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said "something is going wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be tackled in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted to having a "strong view" on the issue.
"Personally, now, I believe it very much. Where did we make the mistake of masculinity?" he said.
“What do we learn in men as they grow up about the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the male characters it promotes.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is being taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they need to show such behavior in order to be men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How can we change that?
“Something has gone wrong with our kids.”
In the interview he also admitted that he does not intend to play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones, after the end of the series next summer, saying "end to battles and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in the revival of Sam Shepherd’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that his acquaintance with his wife Rose is the best thing he has gotten from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in line, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose portrayed Agree, John Snow's love repulse, the character Kite portrays, in the Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In their overwhelming majority, the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, signaling a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread rapidly to certain parts of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost zeroed out, as China's health sector officials had said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains a common phenomenon.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies she leaked data from Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information of three Republican senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic lawmaker in Los Angeles said the allegations were being promoted by commentators and “extreme right” websites.
"Lies, lies and even more horrible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senators Lindsey Graham and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill environment during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and published the details of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded claim is a completely untrue and blatant lie,” Waters continued.
“My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been breached due to these fraudulent and false claims, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is a completely untrue and blatant lie.”
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fletcher.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleiser wrote.
“This shows that he doesn’t have the courage to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It shouldn't be brave.
He should not question the motives of the one who accuses him.
It has to be calm and peaceful.”
Fletcher seemed to compare Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by his critics of appearing very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican nominee seeking to run Waters in the midterms, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified “the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations.”
“We will do everything in our power to find those responsible and to hold them accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and all of my staff.”
Johnny English Reboots - A Subtonic Spy Movie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new film with a British character and this seems to be the case in this revival of the action-comedy film franchise starring Johnny Ingles, which began in 2003 with the Johnny English film and returned in 2011 with the Johnny English film.
Can this humorous self-defense on the subject of how obviously messed up we are to become the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Ingles with his curly eyes was able to renew his license to make them gossip for a second time. His name states that it is a wider comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematographers.
It's of course about the amazement secret agent who while pretending to have the glow and manners of a secret agent, brings a little to Cluzo, with a dose of "master bean" and something from the guy who played a single note in the musical theme of the 2012 film The Roads of Fiumicino.
It is also based on the traveler and international mystery man that Atkinson once disguised himself in Barclaycard’s most forgotten television commercials, sowing chaos in his passing.
There are one or two good moments in this latest JE film.
I liked it when Johnny Ingles approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propellers hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent in comedy, however, humor is quite subtly and strangely paranoid, especially at a time when "serious" film franchises like 007 and Dangerous Mission now include quite a few comedic elements.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny Inglis’s crazy setbacks are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson’s film-like sketches for Bean’s character.
The eternal central issue is that the UK has a serious problem.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's top secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on a mission, to the utter disappointment of the undercover agent, who is being duped by Kevin E.
It’s the last drop for a poignant and ambitious prime minister on the verge of collapse due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing the best she can with this character reminiscent of Theresa May, but the script doesn’t help her much.
The intelligence advisers inform her that, as every active spy has been revealed, she will have to restore someone disarmed.
And that means Johnny Ingles, who now works as a director at an aristocratic school, but gives informal lessons for secret agents: here there are some nice scenes, as Ingles offers a spy academy of the type A School More
Ingles returns to Whitehall for an urgent briefing and reunites with Buff's former and passionate partner, who is again dressed up as Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role in which Vicky Peperdin is not fully exploited.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the graffiti for the Secret Service of Her Majesty return to the action, meeting the beautiful and fateful Ofelia Buletova who is disguised as Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously fascinated by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s technological woes: the menacing Jason Volta, who is portrayed by Jake Lacey.
Inglis and Baf begin the odyssey of their pharmacoma: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a sloppy French restaurant, they cause chaos as they try to illegally board Volta's luxury yacht.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as adorable and quirky as it is, it continues to resemble a little children's television.
Moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I wonder: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really excels with his talent?
Labour denies that they are considering a plan for the British to work four days, but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is about to consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five-day work.
The party, according to information, seeks to channel the savings achieved through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend, without reducing their wages.
Sources say the idea is in line with the party’s economic agenda and plans in order to turn the scales in favor of workers.
The change to a four-day week was approved by the Congress of Labor Unions as a way to benefit workers from the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A policy change is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day work week is an ambition aligned with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as the party’s overall strategy for industry.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.”
The shadow government’s secretary, John McDonnell, used last week’s Workers’ Conference to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
MacDonald said he was determined to regain power from “individual directors” and “speculators” in utility companies.
The shadow government secretary’s plans also mean that today’s shareholders in water companies may not get their full share back, as a potential Labour government could make “reservations” due to suspected troubles.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of the companies and create mutual funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who will receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy talk on 60 Minutes about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could help dissuade some Republican senators.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could unravel anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open-mindedly than his South Carolina counterpart, and he's the only one who's ever seen him.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said that when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him directly, “Did you do it?”
He was immobile, determined, categorical.”
However, Graham’s vote does not seem to change.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh and I'm going to need some explosive accusation to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blue Ford.
"And whoever has named it, he cannot confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and well-known stars, but also an equally impressive mission: the eradication of global poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are expected to flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi Bee and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international lobbying group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of those actively fighting against it.
In order to secure a free ticket at the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing someone to contact the world leader, calling or finding others.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while there are still 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert the right way to convince our fellow citizens to take action or is it just another case of so-called "clique activism", that is, when some feel that they really make a difference by signing an electronic request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen team reports that it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, promoting a number of different goals.
He says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion, which are set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the hedged funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and implementers, who have undertaken a commitment “to help children make the most of their potential”, promising to give Rwanda a pledge of $35 million from Global’s two-year fundraising fund.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracy Ullman, the 2018 ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, told the audience during the live broadcast.
The group also said that following more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called The Power of Nutrition, which targets 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
Answering the question "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?" included in the site's Frequently Asked Questions,
A member of the Global Citizen community responded: “The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But like all the great movements for human rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because united we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Sean Mendes, Cardi Bee and Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. may use the Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington could turn to its Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from being deployed to markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where it is attempting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reasons they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States has the ability, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them, to ensure that Russian energy is not marketed," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group dubbed the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a pony who knows only one trick", as it has an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration has taken on a mission to boost exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, will make Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project with a budget of 11 billion dollars, which is going to double the existing capacity of the pipelines to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s strong resistance to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak told Pyongyang's Energy Minister after a meeting with the Minister of Energy.
The U.S. stance provoked Germany’s reaction, which underscored its commitment to the project.
Germany’s top industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kebf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Prosorcie Prosorcie Merkel.
“Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for the presidency in 2020,” says the Massachusetts U.S. Senator from Massachusetts.
The Massachusetts senator, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday she would seriously consider declaring her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
At a meeting in the City Hall of Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our troubled government, and that’s why we need a woman at the top,” she told The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider the possibility of a candidacy for the Presidency."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying that "it's driving the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” he said.
Warren didn't chew on her words about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote.”
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren’s voters do not believe she should run for the presidency in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% were in favour of such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for a possible candidacy than former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other popular names by Democrats discussed in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would have made a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin referred to Trac Palin's Posttraumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump's rally
Trac Paylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“With what my son has been going through since he returned, I can understand other families living with the effects of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and the injuries our soldiers are carrying when they return home,” she told the audience at a gathering for Dondal.
Palin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said of her son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, they come back a little tougher, they come back a lot of people wondering if there's any respect for what they've done for the country, the armies.
He was arrested Monday in Wassila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering in a report of domestic violence and gun ownership while in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wassila police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the questioning of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to provide asylum to victims trying to escape gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the region submitted an amicus curiae report Friday in Washington supporting an asylum seeker to challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" were abusing her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
He had been detained in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as countries facing intense gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board (BIA) and allowed undeclared migrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Rasin, said on Friday that the new policy "misses decades of state, federal and international law."
"According to federal law, all asylum applications must be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application. Such an obstacle violates this principle", according to the report amicus curiae.
Lawyers also claimed in the report that policies denying entry to immigrants harmed the U.S. economy, proposing that they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and “become the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims who are trying to escape situations of domestic violence and gangs.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political view,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, as the number of dead doubles despite the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation continued to worsen.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma, trying to relieve her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center set up in the devastated town of Palou.
"Every minute the ambulances bring in other bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Some residents tried to return to their damaged homes and collect through the waters their belongings, trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which suffered damage from the 7.5-magnitude Richter-scale earthquake, were unable to meet the needs.
Some wounded, such as Dewey Harris, who suffered a fractured shoulder and waist, remained outside the Palou Army Hospital, where first aid was given to the countryside due to ongoing strong aftershocks.
Tears flooded his eyes as he narrated how he felt the violent earthquake rocking the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Intimidation’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper promising mutual trade benefits between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China blamed Beijing for using it.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid insert that appeared on the Des Moines Register, the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in a congressional election on Nov. 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election signaled what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While foreign governments are not prohibited from posting ads to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a escalating trade war and have imposed various tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s tariff retaliation at the beginning of the trade war was aimed at hitting exporters to states such as Iowa backed by Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former long-time governor in Iowa, a state that is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt America’s workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, “indulges in this kind of intimidation by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press.”
“In an effort to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting America’s precious tradition of free speech and free press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” he wrote.
“In contrast, in Beijing’s booths, you will find few divergent voices and no true representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economic course, given that the media is under the control of the Communist Party of China.”
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not reveal which.
Republicans alienate women voters in the run-up to midterm elections because of the fiasco with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn there will be a reaction, particularly from women, to the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions on this issue are particularly tense and most Republicans have said they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be restored," Grand Reier, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill, referring to an article published Saturday.
Reer doubts that the last-minute move by Senator Jeff Fleck (R-Arizona) to ask the FBI for an investigation will be enough to attract angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they’re not going to forget it tomorrow, and they’re definitely not going to forget it in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan "November is coming!" in the Senate hallway as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee gave the green light for Mr. Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Mi. Christ's testimony.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach record levels," Rodenberg, an unrivalled political analyst, said on the news site.
“They say it’s already high, and that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of indecisive women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old who, while disliking the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford’s public testimony in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual abuse against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts had predicted that there could be a reaction if Republicans proceed with the bill.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party," Michael Stile, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put out. It's also about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe after the depositions of Fortn and Kavanaugh, putting themselves slightly more in favour of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Fleck’s move, the FBI began investigating Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh attacked her while he was drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals while at a party when they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new pinnacle of this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on Berners Lee’s Open Solids platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “global domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all of them at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal online data storage space is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this capability “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers who worked on the project, and a community of volunteer code developers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes by overturning business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a publication in Medium released on Saturday, Berners Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners Lee has been a strong voice in the debate about Internet neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet,” added Berners Lee.
Bernard Van: A tribute to a cleric who received the Victorian Cross in World War I
The only cleric of the Anglican Church to have received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a soldier was honored in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van received the medal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had deflected the highest British military distinction.
On Saturday, a plaque was unveiled by his two grandchildren, which was accompanied by a parade in Rasden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the plaque's revelations took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Van led his regiment to the St. Kent Canal in the midst of a very dense fog and while receiving heavy fire from combat weapons and machine guns.
Later, he rushed to the front line and with "extraordinary courage" led the line forward, before hitting alone with a three-man combat weapon from the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s heroic actions were “something I know I could never reach, it’s something that makes you feel unlimited respect.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also deposited a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he "felt great honour to have participated in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he has from many people."
MMA Fans Stayed Overnight to Watch Bellator 206, But Saw Peppa the Pig
Think of the following scenario: you’ve stayed overnight to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but you’re deprived of the joy of seeing this unique sporting event.
The program in San Jose included 13 games, including six on the main card, and would be broadcast live in the UK, from Channel 5, in the night zone.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gegard Musashi and Rory McDonald were getting ready to go out in the ring, viewers in the UK were stunned when the show changed to Peppa the Pig.
Some were not happy at all, as they had stayed awake until the early hours of the morning especially for the race.
A Twitter fan described the screening of the children’s program as “some kind of sick joke.”
“According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., so the children’s program had to be screened,” said Dave Blacks, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig, yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Cocker said they were going to work on the program to include UK viewers in the future.
“If we think about the ripples, I think we can do it,” Cocker said.
“But it’s six o’clock Sunday morning there and we won’t be able to do it until our own time on Sunday, i.e. their own Monday.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change took place, a lot of messages were exchanged back and forth and they were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you that next time this will not happen.
We're going to limit it to five races instead of six, as we usually do, we've tried to offer more to the fans and we've gone too far.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Lower’ Due to Sexuality
The Diving Olympian, Tom Daley, said he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, however, this prompted him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he hadn’t realized until high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking to the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she advocated gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that since becoming a parent, he is less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the well-known radio show, was on sick leave for several months.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Dale said he felt "insufficient" compared to others when he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable for someone to like both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity have given me the strength and the will to succeed.”
He wanted to prove it was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympian is a prominent defender of the rights of the LOATKI community and has taken advantage of his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to proceed with the decriminalization of homosexuality.
He said that he decided to talk, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without consequences, and that he wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Dale married Oscar-winning actor Dustin Lance Black last year, who is 20 years his senior, but argued that the age difference was never an issue.
"When you're going through so much at such a young age" (he first competed in the Olympics at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a teenager who has similar good and bad times."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daily said he had changed "his whole outlook."
“If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal,” he said.
“But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold olympic medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they had made tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be around us to sit in the front row,’” he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was dead I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I'd been dreaming of all my life, to go diving at the Olympics in my home country, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which inspired him in his preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes him shiver.
Desert Island Discs broadcasts on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Michaelson will be on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mikkelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to improve his performance so he doesn’t remember him for the wrong reasons.
Mikkelson, who participates for the 12th time (record number) in the races held every two years, was forced by Chief Jim Furick to sit on the bench for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as is customary for the United States, the five-time winner distributed the day to cheer off the lines and “work” his game in the hopes of correcting his problematic points.
Without ever having been the most direct driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old’s game is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National, where the distant ones are often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the pitch wasn’t enough, Mikkelson, in Sunday’s ninth race, faces Francesco Molinari, the British Open champion, who is teaming up with the first-timer Tommy Flitwood to win the four races this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Michaelson’s play can be critical.
Furik expressed his confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
“He fully understood the role he’s playing today, he kindly hit me on the back, he put his hand around me and said he’d be ready for tomorrow,” he said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and he has offered a lot to these teams, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up, so we thought we should go.
He wants to go out there like everyone else.”
Michaelson will surpass Nick Fallo’s record for most Sunday games in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that did not reach the height of his individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furik said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make plates and he's excellent in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also had fun teasing him this week. It was funny to see it.
His contribution is not just in the game.”
The head of the European team, Thomas Björn, knows that the big lead can be lost soon
Thomas Björn, the head of the European team, knows from his experience that a big lead starting from last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a defeat.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 race at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Balester managed to take a five-point lead over the Americans, but only managed to cross the final line with a breaststroke, winning 141–1.
“You constantly remind yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama, we had a great lead at Brookline National, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but barely,” Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching both the 10th and the 6th generation of 2018 to win the 3rd.
So the story will show me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
We're going to be ready tomorrow to give it all away.
We'll go out there and play right.
Nothing's finished until you see the grades on the board.
We have a goal, to win this trophy, and that’s where we focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know very well that in the other team there are just as good players – the best in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: “I wouldn’t be in a hurry to anticipate the result.
Tomorrow's another beast.
Tomorrow's individual performance counts, and that's something different.
It’s great to be on the court with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, then you’re testing your golfing skills to the fullest.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, how to make the best of themselves tomorrow.
You leave your teammate behind and he has to give it all and show his best self.”
Unlike Björn, Jim Furick from the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performances than they had with their teammates, except for Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four.
Forick himself has experienced both extremes of the last day's setbacks, as he belonged to the winning team at Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every single word of him," he said when asked how Ben Crenso, the 1999 leader, had gathered his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like at Brookline, like at Medinah.
When we get this momentum, there is a lot of pressure in the intermediate races.
We decide our turn accordingly and play in the order that suits us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has taken over to lead the race and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
"I went with this team in this series because I think it covers the entire route," Björn said, explaining his choices for the singles.
New Postponement for Germany's New Warship
The new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War-era warships, but it is not expected to be delivered until next year at least, due to faulty systems and rising costs.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz frigate, the flagship of the all-new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which relies on a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems with delivery have been decisive for the fate of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
They will carry a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as it will be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years outside German ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that although warships are considered state-of-the-art, which will allow Germany to show its power abroad, until they are finally put into service, they will already be outdated, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Much information about the reasons for the return has not been made known, but German media reported a number of significant "flaws in the software and hardware" that would render the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The software problems were particularly significant; as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, only half compared to the older Bremen class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship has a much higher weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz frigate is believed to have twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the cost of the entire project (including the training of the crew) was also an issue.
It is said that it reached the illiquid amount of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion euros), while the initial budget was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems plaguing the new frigates are particularly significant as Germany’s naval power shrinks.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy "will soon have no ships for missions."
The official said the problem intensified over time because the old ships were disarmed, but there were no other ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust hides the secret life of bats
New research being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting for their food.
The findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to the design of future actions to protect the environment.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nano- and micro- bat, as well as the brown ear bat and Dobenton's myotitis in the gardens of Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special loggers will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The analysis of the sound of all recordings by specialists will determine the frequency of calls of bats, as well as what types have this behavior.
A map of the habitat and an exhibition will then be created to form a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Duar, NTS’s natural environment protection adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly since the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect the places where they roam and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting are also a danger, as are flies adhesive tapes and some chemical processes of building materials, as well as attacks by house cats.
Butterflies aren't actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their prey.
They use an advanced sound-tracking technique to detect insects and obstacles in the course of their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, considers bats very important.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct regular surveys, inspect the places where bats hatch, and sometimes save them.
The organisation has also set up Scotland’s first and only bat-only shelter on the Threave estate, in Damfris and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten bat species live.
The landlord of the estate, David Thompson, states that the estate is the ideal ground for bats.
"Here at Threave we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
“We have the old buildings, lots of big trees and an ideal habitat.
There’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to grow their populations.”
He stresses that it is important to first check for bats before any maintenance work in homes, as the destruction of a single nest with young could kill up to 400 females and young, potentially eliminating the entire local population.
Bats are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, harass them or disturb their silence, or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a member of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said: “There is a lot left to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don’t know the evolution of their population.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” saying that some “want to self-defense” by exploiting his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese national and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Katherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, he reportedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and not mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to 142 million of his followers after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said on camera.
“They want to see themselves and take advantage of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I’m happy and all is well,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations he published, which they described as "unacceptable reports of rumors touching privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Skerts said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage of a proportionate amount to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious privacy violations in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting them at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Maiorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her unnaturally, according to documents filed with the Clark County Regional Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was by "99 percent" a "good guy", but betrayed by the other "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo admits that they had sexual intercourse, but that she was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she "feared the possibility of retaliation" and was concerned about her "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she is trying to reverse the settlement as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic syndrome due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of getting transferred to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse and this summer he switched to Italian Juventus securing a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK ‘will forever regret’ the loss of automakers <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The UK will “forever regret” if it loses its reputation as a global leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily halt production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of cross-border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Burnston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production will be halted at our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's chief executive officer in Bernaston.
And other automakers in the UK have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to risks in the supply chain, according to the auto companies in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line follows just-in-time. Spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, resulting in delays and a shortage of parts according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stock beyond one day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would stop.
Clarke said Theresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is specifically trying to resolve the issue of cross-border controls."
"We want the best possible deal that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence that comes not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is imperative to ensure continuity of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how much coal it would halt production, however, warned that in the long run the additional cost would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnston for 24 years and is Unite’s union manager at the factory, said that union members are increasingly concerned: “From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they are never going to come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House said in a statement.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "delay another week" as the dispute over the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, Trump’s assistants’ connections to Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility of Trump firing the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a horn in order to record his conversations with Trump and make it possible to remove the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
However, on Monday, he moved to the White House amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to coincide with the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct filed a lawsuit against him.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh within a week, further delaying a vote by the House of Representatives.
Sarah Sanders, a spokeswoman for Trump, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set yet, maybe this week, but maybe another week of data on all the other cases in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, after all, I like to always keep the press informed."
Some journalists have refuted this claim: Sanders has been holding a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this was happening.
Sanders responded that the limited frequency of updates was not due to aversion to the “impression” movements of television journalists, although she said: “I will not disagree with the fact that they are being shown.”
He then hinted that there would be increased or direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The president is giving more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without quoting evidence: "We looked at these numbers."
There will still be updates, Sanders said, but "if the press has the ability to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's incomparably better than talking to me.
We're trying to implement it often and you've seen that we've been implementing it often in the last few weeks and it will take the place of the press release where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with official visitors.
Individual press interviews are very rare.
This week in New York the president probably proved why this is happening, with an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of gathered journalists.
Minister of Health sends letter to EU citizens working at Scotland’s National Health System amid fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU citizens employed in Scotland’s National Health System to express the country’s gratitude and to wish them to remain even after the UK’s departure from the European Union.
Gin Freeman, a Scottish MP, has sent a letter, with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applications for settled status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued and are heading towards expected decisions in the fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Cristian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
Tennessee State Tigers defender Cristion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's game, where the Tennessee State Tigers were defeated by a 31-27 score by the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time mark.
"He came to the counter and just collapsed there," Reed said.
The gymnasts and medical staff gave Abercrobe oxygen to the counter and then put him on a stretcher and transported him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV television station in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrobbie had left the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "still no evidence of the type/extension of the injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student with a limited participation status ("redshirt"), spends his first season in Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five total taklins on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching 18 total taklins for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty for the purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty to buy real estate in the UK, while the extra money will be used to provide assistance to the homeless, according to the new plans of the Tories.
The measure will offset the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on those buyers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to provide assistance to the homeless
Foreign buyers will start to pay a higher stamp duty to buy real estate in the UK, while the extra money will be used to help the homeless, as Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-wage workers.
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the UK, while the additional funds will strengthen the government’s campaign to combat the lack of housing.
The surcharge, imposed on the current stamp duty, together with the higher tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second homes and rental homes, may amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will yield up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, leading to higher prices and making it harder for first-time home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp fee so that more young people could get their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of keeping real estate prices high, but acquiring land without using it, and called on Mrs May to remove the ceilings in economic dwellings in order to restore Britain’s “housing shame.”
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms, which include rent checks and a ban on "blameless" evictions.
It also wants to give greater powers to councils in order to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime minister to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
And this implies the repair of the dismantled real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it would not be right for non-UK residents and overseas-based companies to buy homes as easily as hard-working British nationals.
For too many people the dream of owning a home has now become too distant and the unworthiness of the lack of housing remains.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach the Scottish team"
Sanderland head Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to someday become the coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is thrilled with the challenge to resurrect the North East England team, which is currently in third place in the Third Division of England (League One), three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer, having previously reinstated St Mirren to the Scottish Championships the previous season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team and that was it," Ross told the Scottish BBC on the radio show Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching the Scottish team in Hamburg all the time with my dad as a kid, and that’s something that always pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I am successful in team training.”
Among Ross's predecessors in Sanderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet and Paolo DiCanio.
The former Aloe Athletic coach says he felt no awe when he was asked to follow such established names in such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Right now, success for me will be measured by the answer to the question, 'Can I bring this team back to the Premier League?'"
Because of the structure and facilities of this team, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy job to get there, but I’ll probably consider myself successful here only if I can get the team back there.”
Ross started his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months at the Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Aloe recover from the downsizing in the third category and led St. Mirren from the edge of the downsizing to win the Championship next season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he said, recalling taking up the position of Aloa's coach.
“I really thought it was better for me to be a coach than a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, I was making decent money out of it, and I had gotten pretty high.
But playing can be hard.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.
I’m still struggling with the stress and pressure of the job, but my coach’s job fits perfectly.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I’ve felt with myself in my entire adult life.”

The summer heat boosted profits for Britain’s tried-and-tested pubs but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw sales grow by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent, as the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consulting company, which collected the data, said: "Continuous sunshine and the largest of England's expected participation in the World Cup had the result that in July, they still followed a similar pattern to the previous month, the IOC.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant revenues in June simply worsened in July.
Pubs and bars serving alcohol fared far better, with the corresponding figures of previous years having risen more than the corresponding figures of restaurants have fallen.
The pubs that serve food also suffered on sunny days, though not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, from RSM’s Recreation and Hospitality Analysts Division, said: “These results confirm the trend we’ve seen since late April.
Time and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales in the off-home market.
It’s not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8 percent drop in sales on an annual basis will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn’t have appeared at a worse time for business owners in the spotlight, and time will show whether the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a much-needed extension.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand name launches.

One in five children maintain secret accounts on social media, secretly from their parents
One in five children — even as young as 11 — maintain secret accounts on social media, secretly from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has revealed an increase in fake Insta pages on Instagram.
This news has intensified fears that sexual content is being uploaded
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account to show to their parents.
One in five children - even as young as 11 - create social media accounts, which they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta accounts – a report on Instagram’s photo sharing website.
This news intensified fears that he was posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they maintain a healthy “main” account to show to their parents, while maintaining private accounts at the same time.
A mother who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who urged others to rape her (“rape me”).
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Board of School Directors (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, while half of them admitted to keeping accounts secret.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t locate them.”
Alice Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish board of directors
Elaine Doyle was elected as a non-executive advisor to the Scottish Steering Board at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track and field athlete, and President Ian Biti has commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
"Elid enjoys infinite respect for the entire Scottish, British and global trail community and we are confident that the trail in Scotland will have a huge benefit from her entry to the board," Biden said in a statement.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal in the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, having won a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator at the BBC, has been left paralyzed after a passing spell.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if and how I will recover.
It was exhausting, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Breastfeeding advertising that compares mothers with cows divides online public opinion
A breastfeeding company has split the online public opinion with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows who breastfeed them.
In order to launch the so-called "world's first silent and portable teenage girl", consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous ad inspired by video clips to highlight the freedom it offers to breastfeeding non-smokers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay, with a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm breastfeeding myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't boobs, these are my boobs."
The choir continues, "Pump it, pump it, I feed babies, pump it, pump it, milk my ladies."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has garnered mixed reactions from viewers as many say it doesn’t take the “horror” of the dairy industry seriously.
"Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies steal it a few days after birth.”
Elvie's nurse fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Apparently traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breastfeeding for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added: "An advertisement completely out of reality."
Others defended the ad, while one woman admitted that her song seemed “joking.”
“I think it’s a very smart idea.
I'd buy a babysitter like that if I were still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I didn't sit around over-analyzing it.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a funny advertisement that targets mothers who pump breast milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women’s team reveals that they were all dancing with the discreet teats embedded in their bras.
The rationale behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump breast milk with a breastfeeding mother say they feel like cows.
The Elvie breastfeeder, however, is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even come out during pumping.
Ana Ballarin, partner and Creative Executive Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie panty is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Making a parallel between breastfeeding women and lactating cows, we wanted to focus on pumping breast milk and all the challenges it entails, while at the same time showing in a fun and correlative way the incredible feeling of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for fashion designer Marta Yakubovski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved Silently to Camp on Texas Border
The number of children in detention has risen, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder for children to be matched.
Traditionally, most of the supporters are immigrants without travel documents and are afraid to go out and ask for a child and thus endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk intensified in June when federal authorities announced that potential conservatives and other adult members of their household would have to provide fingerprints and that data would be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to support unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had a white criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of the people who are either maintainers or members of the household of the maintainers are in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these individuals," Mr. Albens said.
In order to speed up the handling of children’s cases, the authorities introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear in court within one month from the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as was previously the case.
Many will appear via video conferencing, in place of a face-to-face appearance, in order to develop their claims for granting legal status before the immigration judge in charge.
Those who are deemed not to meet the conditions for exemption will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become stressed or distressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are intensifying in larger facilities such as Tornio, where indications that a child is having difficulty are more likely not to be perceived because of the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the scene without being given enough time to prepare the children psychologically or say goodbye to their friends can aggravate the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will receive appropriate response."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions more have been torn from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "give this sacred battle until we banish all Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and inform both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Muallem said conditions are good for their return and blamed "certain Western countries" for "spreading absurd fears" that prompted refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to rebuild Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a de-militarized zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity to advance political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "extirpated".
U.N. Special Envoy Stephane de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections soon.
Mualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no interventions should be made.
Trump will also win a second term in office.
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope, the rebuke and scandals prematurely end his presidency.
Something that would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic presidential finale of all time!"
So far, there is no indication of tiredness of the viewers.
Since 2014, TV viewing numbers in the high-view zone have doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled, reaching 1.6 million on MSNBC.
The Fox News television network has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the high-view zone, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC television show “The Rachel Maddow Show” has scanned the numbers of 3.5 TV shows.
It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neil Bayer, producer of the ABC drama series “Designated Survivor” where a minister becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comic book writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked, "why?"
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovel told me.
One can have fun even with the chaos.
Of course, unlike the TV series, the scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy v. Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite and the health of the global economy.
The frequency change is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you surpass the definition of an informed citizen when you are six hours watching a group of experts discuss the use of "multiple interviews in the background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear" ("Fear"), Pol's bomber jacket.
I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way, though.
"What makes and makes you feel like a reality show is that it gives you something every night," said Brenda Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the television show "Pawn Stars," about the ever-changing actors and daily updates.
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you're left behind.
When I met Mr. Flies this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He could not get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging from a thread.
“I remember doing those crazy shows back in the day and people were like, ‘This is going to be the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Flyce told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right in the end."

Foreign money flows into the most marginal contest for the midterm elections
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional constituency is receiving a cash flow, thanks to the re-alignment of the congressional constituencies, which has put two active members of Congress candidates for the same position.
This newly redesigned suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected to another district in special elections held last spring.
Lamb's opponent is another active representative, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who represents the former Pennsylvania's 12th constituency, which largely coincides with the new 17th constituency.
The maps were redesigned following a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that ruled in January that the old regions were being manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The election contest in the new 17th constituency sparked a campaign of financial competition between the parties’ largest financial departments, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow victory in a special election contest held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional constituency, which was attended by many people.
This position was held by Republicans for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 points.
Political analysts give the Democrats a slight lead.
The United States has considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but has backed off.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, eliciting mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and maintained a hotel in Panama until the partners dismissed the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to revoke the U.S. head of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions by the U.S. Department of State to no longer recognize Taiwan," he said earlier.
But sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country, with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, as a follow-up to a corresponding gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in the progress of the negotiations.
But in mid-September, top executives made it clear that they wanted to move forward with the conference, effectively ending the thoughts of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is going to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in an indication of the great importance of the meeting for the administration, as the diplomats said.
All three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House press secretary on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultations, under the auspices of the White House.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
READ HISTORY
The next blow may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which very strong evidence has now been made public.
It is rumored that Mr. Mueller is also turning his research to the possibility of collusion between Mr. Trump’s election campaign and Russia regarding the Russian attack in our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be found accountable before this body as he prepares to reclaim the presidency in the next election and perhaps eventually before an affidavit court.
The 'if' is a lot and I do not imply that the fall of Mr Trump, nor of his bonds in Europe, is inevitable.
There are choices we must all make on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The flow of history revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable course of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a lot of these turning points.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he was written in that newspaper that last year he proposed to secretly record the president and that he considered him unsuitable for the position of president.
Mr Rosenstein said the version adopted by the Times was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite reasonable accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But because of the lesson I took in the Thing, I don't think we're going to fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Jewish Sabbath candles at that table with the swastika.

Graham Dorans of the Rangers is optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers welcomes Rapid Wien on Thursday, knowing that the win over the Austrians, after the impressive tie in Spain with Vijayarreal earlier this month, will give her plenty of chances of qualifying from Group 7 of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented the average Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until the 2-2 tie with Vijayarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for greater success.
“It was a good time for us because Vijayarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game believing we could achieve something and we came out with a degree.
Perhaps we could escape in the end, but, in general, the equilibrium was a fairly fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were a better team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another big European night.
Well having things, we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they brought a good result to their last game, but with the world on the stage, I am sure we can do our best and bring a positive result.
“Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and the changes that have been made to the team itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, the training is good.
Let’s hope that we can do our best now, let go of last season and succeed.”
Women are losing their sleep because of their fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few discussed it with their family.
Nearly half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they are discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it to their children.
“People want to be cared for by their family, but they don’t take the initiative to do the discussion,” said Holly Schneider, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Start with that.
Talk to your husband and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care for you if you don’t express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at a purchase price to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own property – as long as you have the money.
Compile your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a health care proxy to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that health care professionals will comply with your wishes in case you are unable to contact them.
Also, consider the possibility of making a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid in case you become incapacitated.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Report these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just about the finances, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure you prepare this plan.”
Man Receiving Multiple Shots With Air Gun In Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with an aerial gun as he was walking toward his home last night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon County when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the incident, which took place at 2:30 a.m. British Summer Time, as an "accidental event".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries he sustained are not life-threatening and the police are calling for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, while the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications have been disrupted, humanitarian aid forces have failed to receive information from Dongala, an area north of Palo, which is closer to the center of the 7.5-degree Richter scale earthquake.
In Palou, more than 16,000 people were removed after the outbreak of the disaster.
The following are some important facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a kingdom stretching along more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline in the southwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The re-kingdom, a level of administrative division below the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main supports of the economy of the central Sulawesi province and especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly found in Morowali, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Service.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
The tsunami also struck western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located within the seismic Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are as follows:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Atsheh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean while over half of them were found.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds killed on the island of Nia, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree Richter-scale earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6-degree Richter-scale earthquake centered near the city of Pandang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree Richter-scale earthquake struck one of the Mendawi Islands near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-frequency earthquake hit the Pindi Jaya area in Ascheh, causing disaster and panic as it brought to the world memories of the disaster sown by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that fell.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lobok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin’s first-born son has been arrested for domestic violence.
Trac Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Palin, from Wassila, Alaska, has been arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, obstruction of a domestic violence complaint, and resistance to the rule, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troops.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police to report the crimes he allegedly committed, he grabbed her phone from her hands.
Palin is being held temporarily at the Mat-Su Temporary Reservation Store, with a $500 security deposit, as reported on the KTUU television station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "certainly, innocent" when asked, as the network reports.
Palin faces charges for three Class A offences, which means he can be sentenced to up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Category A offence, punishable by one-day imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time a criminal case has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of prosecution for the criminal offence of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while in a drunken state.
His partner claimed that he shoved her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from veterans groups in 2016 when she linked her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people lost their lives after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are released from the moment of the catastrophic event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Call for Rarely Imposed Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the imposition of the death penalty on Saifulo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has been imposed on the state for confederation.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane along West Side Avenue in Lower Manhattan, luring pedestrians and cyclists who were found on his way on Oct. 31.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and caused serious bodily harm "intentionally", according to the New York Times statement of intent to impose the death penalty, filed in court.
Both of these charges entail the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Saipov face-to-face with the 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of homicide in favor of a criminal organization, a tactic often applied by federal prosecutors and prosecutors to criminal organizations.
The attack required “significant planning and thought-out,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out the attack as “disgusting, cruel and indecent.”
"Saifulo Habiboulayevich Saipov caused pain, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Anhelini, Nicolas Clives, An-Lor Decan, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Fuhr.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
It’s been a decade since the last time the New York Southern District Court prosecuted a case involving the death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed for a federal case in New York was in 1953 on the husbands Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spying in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, appeared unrepentant in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was satisfied with his act, according to the police.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack from an ISIS video he saw on his mobile, according to the indictment.
He also asked to set up the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the imposition of the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilt for life imprisonment with no possibility of release will simply prolong the trauma caused by the events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the imposition of the death penalty.
Toris MP Says NEITZEL FARATZ Should Be Negotiating Head of Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during a rally at the Toris convention.
The former head of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians should "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's MPs said he should be at the head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK “would have already come out” by now if Mr Farage was the Brexit minister in charge.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces in her effort to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was underscored by the fact that supporters of staying in the EU Toris participated in a separate rally against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the Chequers compromise plan under control amid attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of staying in the EU and the EU.
The Allies insisted on moving forward with its effort to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest rally in Solihal that he wanted to throw "the Checkers plan".
He said that Mr Farage should have been granted a title of nobility and that he should have been given powers to negotiate with Brussels.
“If we were in charge, we would have left now,” he said.
The MP from Wellington added: “I will support Brexit but we have to throw the Checkers plan away.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr Bowen rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The assumption that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.”
The pro-Brexit Toris MP Andrea Jenkins was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not have the approval of the general public, the Opposition is not going to vote for it, it does not have the approval of our party and our activists who are going down the streets and ultimately electing us.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a sharp message to Mrs. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at the rally that politicians must be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of trust between us - the people - and the order of our policies," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it if you do that.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU protested in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Few activists were waving a Toris banner against Brexit after the group's rally this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with a party application at the start of the congress.
“It’s the same people who tell us that they can put into operation the information systems and all the technological means needed for the EU-Canada Type Agreement with enrichment, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's an absolute fiasco.
“It’s not a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider the possibility of running for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for the presidency after the November election. . . .
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future plans during a rally at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is calling for her re-election in November, with Republican State Representative Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is highly anticipated that he will be able to compete with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters using the structures of the city hall since Trump’s tenure began.
One of the attendees asked her if she was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time “for women to go to Washington to build our disbanded government and that means a woman should be at the top.”
Arrest for the deadly shooting of LSU basketball player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in the deadly shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dieton Simpson at a press conference at 11 p.m. (Eastern Time Zone).
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who appeared in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was fatally shot near the site of Southern University early Friday.
"Wade Simms suffered a bullet wound to the head, which led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the 247sports website.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was found on the spot having a gun in his possession and confessed to shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any resistance and is being held in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The third-year-old Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, with 10 appearances as a key player last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is going for a world title, as his team's instructions gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Walter Boots passed ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team’s orders would play an important role in the race.
At the start, Bottas had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Fetel to attack his stable.
Fetel went first to the pits and let Hamilton run in the queue of the race, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pits a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came out ahead after a wheel-to-wheel battle, which forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior due to the risk of falling into the double-traffic violation to overcome.
Max Ferstapen started from last place and was seventh at the end of the first round on the eve of his 21st birthday.
He then remained first for much of the race as he held his tires aiming to finish quickly and pass ahead of Kimi Rykonen in fourth place.
He eventually went to the pits in the 44th lap, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, as Rykonen came fourth.
It’s a tough day because Walter was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team did very well and did one or two," Hamilton said.
The body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blaisey Ford's letter, in which she accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kava.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "compromising and unwelcome."
“The only thing that could happen is this beautiful thing that’s been happening in the last few days in the Senate, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and bad-tempered and miserable and liars,” he said.
"When you see posts and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you make the leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document-- "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked... no, we didn’t leak,” she added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received Ford's letter containing details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July and she leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak was from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to the Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep her a secret, and I kept her a secret as she asked me."
But her refusal did not seem to particularly convince the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "I'll tell you something, the body language was very bad.
He may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president hinted that Democrats are using the charges to serve their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see misery, misery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample on to take power and control," the president said, according to the news website Mediaite.
Elite League: Dandy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dandy.
Dandy Stars was acquitted of her loss to the Belfast Giants in Friday's Elite League game, winning the rematch 5-3 at Dandy on Saturday.
The Giants took an easy two-goal lead with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Frances Beauvyer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney brought the tie to the hosts before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bussar tied for Dandi and then two goals from Lucas Ludwig Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League during the season for Adam Kiff's men, who came up with a 2-1 win over Dandy at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants taking the win in the previous three games.
Dwyer opened the score in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFollow's assist, while David Rutherford gave the assist thanks to which Bowieer doubled the lead four minutes later.
In an action-packed inaugural period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward gave the assist for the draw from Kauni at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead for the Giants in the first half when he scored his second goal for the evening towards the end of the first period.
The team was reunited and Bussar tied again with a power show goal at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dandy the lead for the first time in the race towards the end of the second period and he secured the win with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their home game with Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Loses His Life To Save Hundreds Of Airplane Passengers From An Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero as he lost his life in an attempt to secure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing due to a major earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many have been trapped in debris in the city of Palou.
But even though his colleagues ran to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunauan Agung refused to leave his position at the manipulative control tower at Palu’s Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Johannes Siret, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian television network ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palou.
"We are shocked by his death," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll may be in the thousands, while the country’s disaster management service says access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Bhutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as many bodies are still under wreckage, many of which we have not been able to reach," said the agency's press spokesman, Sutopo Purgoo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six meters destroyed Palou, which will hold a mass burial ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Riza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute some ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jean Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to save survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widdo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work night and day to complete any work related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lobok, which cost the lives of more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after crashing a plane in a lake
The airline carrying out a flight that crashed in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now reports that a man is missing, while earlier it said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that since Saturday afternoon it has not been able to find traces of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track down the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it was trying to land at the airport on Tsuke Island.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon off the landing runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane had passed the landing runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane had descended too low.
"That's extremely good," said Janes.
Janes said he and others managed to move through the water that reached them as far as the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors working there nearby to improve a dock also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the ship sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in clashes with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of these conflicts involved Air Niugini.
Analyst cites the schedule of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded its pleading on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
She explained to the jury how she used cell phone records to sequence the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Roulett said he received location records from several mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, refuting his previous allegations, as reported by the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's cell phone during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sandford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "He was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone records showed that they were only known for a week.
Roulett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tiles deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is set to begin its bidding on Sunday.
The judge said he estimated that later that day the trial would be put on trial by the jury.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre, filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has escaped its roots, which were political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common experience a recent recovery in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
There's another black guy?
New York’s Nanny Sues Couple Who Fired Her After Receiving ‘Racist’ Message
A New York-based nanny is suing a couple for racist dismissal after receiving a text message from her mother that the latter complained that the nanny was "another black man."
The couple denies that they are racist, likening the treatment to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she realized that the new nanny Jizel Morris was black, as soon as the latter appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
"Eighteen-third other black man," Ms. Plasko-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and twice.
As soon as she realized her graffiti, the now awkward Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was an African-American, had not done a good job at all and was waiting in her place for a Filipina, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Morris was paid for her one day’s work and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Ms. Morris has filed a lawsuit against the couple seeking compensation for dismissal and is claiming compensation of $350 a day for the six-month-long work as an internal nanny, for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discreet treatment."
The couple refutes claims that they are racist, saying it made sense to fire Morris, as they feared they could not trust her again after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even by accident?
Your new-born baby?
Come on now."
Comparing the treatment to "extortion," Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you be chasing someone who is in this situation?
It’s not that polite,” added the banker.
While the legal case is in progress, the court of public opinion hurried to condemn the couple on social media, condemning them for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not be interested in a talking teddy bear, as a new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to replace someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the huge success of Paddington.”
She said her father, who worked as a illustrator at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a teddy bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet-pearl", as well.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn’t proud,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so true in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who does something: you’re proud of it even if it’s not really your achievement.
I think that's how he saw the success of Paddington.
Although it was a creation of his own and of his own imagination, he always paid tribute to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye from the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nand was constantly calling and telling me that it was very bad, that he didn’t have a lot of hope for it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“At one point, Nan called me to tell me he was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tassi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were slowly diminishing and were getting out of her body.
He had already died a few hours before and at that time and now everything was gone.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
“I had to stay cool.”
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, who has so far mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who ignored the ordeal she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
“I had my head down and they were crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, there was a feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women who mourn the loss of their own faces hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicides.
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys hang on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that can be called in order to receive support.
Mrs. Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a very promising chef, with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened his room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as "he was in a very bad condition".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had ended his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried there's going to be an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform the world that there are people out there who you can go and talk to, even if they are your friends.
Don't be silent - you have to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt down or sad or anything," he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had caught the bottom on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t look them in the eye.”
He said that his death caused them a huge trauma, but they have to overcome it: "It's disintegrating the family.
He's crushing us.
But we all have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what he was asking for - a limited-time, limited-object investigation - maybe we could bring some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be disbanded amid a stalemate.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their unwillingness is entirely due to the timing.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, on November 6, and if Republicans are not expected to do well, they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to achieve the election of the person they want in the country's supreme court.
George Walker Bush calls Senators, urging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is submitted?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, the vice president, to get a majority and certify his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean rebels is falling under Kim's rule.
The number of apostates from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a lawmaker from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 distances last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges on traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean apostates are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily-protected de-militarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers apostate immigrants illegal rather than refugees and often deports them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are typically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to talk about the denuclearization talks, which have been delayed.
The meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to work together to de-nuclearize the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il accused U.S. sanctions of a lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under these circumstances, we will in no way disarm our country unilaterally first,” Mr. Rim said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he's inappropriate to serve in Supreme Court
Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "mysterious" and said he was unwilling to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman behaved in this way, she would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with intense emotion, denied the accusations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blue Ford when he was both teenagers.
During his inaugural farewell, Kavanaugh was deeply moved, sometimes almost screaming and his voice trembled as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him a "monstrous and coordinated political character murder" organized by liberals who have been angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved he can't serve in the Supreme Court as he showed he's biased against Democrats.
“I think he shut himself out with these statements and the way he did it against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelozy reacted when asked if she would attempt to bring charges against Kavanaugh if his appointment was confirmed and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not suitable not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he's serving in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is a judge at the District Court of Appeals (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelozy added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or in the Roy v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings.
"Isn't it time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to go to court and wait and say, 'Isn't it wonderful?'"
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified outburst, months and years of rage are overflowing and she can't get it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a boss somewhere, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique according to which when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, 'Maybe you think I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And so it just kept going.
And I thought it was excellent."
Tears are allowed as an outburst of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of a job I did in the past, in an office dominated by men, is that I once cried with unspeakable anger and was snatched from my neck by an older woman — a cold manager whom I always feared a little bit — and with a sledgehammer.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset, and they'll be glad they broke it for you."
Patricia Schröder, then a Democratic senator from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his campaign for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and left the race humiliated, Mrs. Schröder, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason not to examine her.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he said, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone described the situation as "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had already begun a long time ago, he was back in funding and so he vowed not to enter the election race if he hadn’t raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he asked.
In her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was too intensely charged with feelings — gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to rally money and target voters for the campaign.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schröder of the press's reactions to her.
“You would think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my gravestone?
"Crying"?
How the U.S.-China trade war can do good in Beijing
The congratulatory congratulations of the trade war between the U.S. and China were staggering and while the battle has a long way to go, a rift between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese exportable products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week, with new duties being imposed on items worth US$200 million (US$150 million), essentially taxing half of all products imported into the U.S. from China.
Beijing returns fires in kind each time, while it has recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on goods worth $60 million.
China is determined to repay the U.S. fire and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to put it down anytime soon.
In order to get Washington to back down, it would have to give in to their demands, but to worship publicly in the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards correctly, U.S. pressures in the context of the trade war could turn out to be positive for China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for an economic collapse in either country is actually much more dangerous than a New York City study has admitted in the past," said Abigail Grace, a research associate with the New York Times.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country’s seven-year-old war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas that were destroyed by the terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Muallem said aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country is welcomed by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe locks the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris in France.
The American team has now been defeated 6 consecutive times on European soil and has won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took the top spot again, as the team of Danish leader Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. team star Phil Mikkelston, who fought hard for the longest time in the tournament, threw his shot into the water at par-3 16th hole, conceding victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his laps and became one of the 4 players who scored 5-0-0 since the tournament's current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spith was defeated in 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Denmark Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olsen.
The best-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, scored 2 and 1 against Ian Pulter of England, who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran eight-Cup Raider Sergio Garcia was crowned the most winning European of all time in the tournament with a total of 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold on.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's all for the team and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He gives the token to compatriot John Ram, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual game on Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride that I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his races in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and has only been surpassed by Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find a goal, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American leader Jim Farrick spoke after his team’s disappointing performance, “I’m proud of these kids, they fought it.
A few moments this morning we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We've fought hard.
Congrats to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I am proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us.”
