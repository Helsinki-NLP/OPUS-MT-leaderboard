Parliament does not support the amendment that gives Tymoshenko freedom
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine in the course of amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code rejected an attempt to cancel the article according to which the leader of the opposition, Yulia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would lead to the release of the imprisoned former prime minister, was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the mitigation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was deemed unprofitable.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will consider Tymoshenko’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko argues that the sentence is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 Members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to ratify it.
Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert. Without him, the war is over.
It is time to determine the winners.
As a rule, Islamists win in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law, which we have already heard about.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because the punishment for theft is the cutting off of the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
In Libya there will be an order that we cannot imagine, and that we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind, nor the best, and would most likely not be suitable, for example, for the population of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have received help from unbelievers.
Their only justification is that, in their opinion, NATO raids were not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after each strike.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
In light of recent sad experiences with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about the expulsion of the "cruisers".
But without the occupation, will the oil companies get Libya’s black gold for almost no price?
They probably won't, and then the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of civil rights.
Unless the Shariah followers put an end to it.
A new wave of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are now in the spotlight of investors.
A statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries released data on GDP in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stagnation, with Germany and France showing growth.
And yet the debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are already looking not only towards Italy; now they have focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the euro area countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by an expected 0.5%; France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the initial 0.1%). France reported a slight decrease, by 0.1% (original information implied stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in a state of stagnation. According to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
Key Events :
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany’s economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed growth of 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with analysts' forecasts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The yield of its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The return on both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the yield on Czech 1-year bonds remains around 4%.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor who can save the situation.
The Czech national team was selected for the EURO.
In Montenegro, they won with a score of 1:0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully completed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and the beautiful goal of Peter Yira<0xC4><0x8D>ek, they won with a score of 1: 0.
In the second half, the Czech team was fortunate to retain a significant advantage after the home rebound match, and they will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz monitored the progress of the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and good luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the team's defeat at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Yira<0xC4><0x8D>ek; won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates the start of the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanovic and Vucinic became the most unsuccessful pair of the match after missing two great opportunities.
The magnificent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech is one of the reasons why the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year. And Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
The game was very tense from the first minute.
Both teams struggled with the combinations; the game was in the middle of the field most of the time.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the host team in the first half. Long-range strikes against the defensive line were carefully intercepted by the Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred students at the university have created a living shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In doing so, they wish to express their support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday at noon following the prayers of the students before the entrance to the building followed a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They have thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country’s nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that everything indicates that Iran has not abandoned an attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran has been discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday at noon following the prayers of students before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel was followed.
In the event of an attack aimed at the maximum paralysis of Iran's nuclear program, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Feeding Obesity-Suffering Children: No Breakfast and Sausage for Dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are obese.
According to the latest study, children who are obese usually come from families that lead an unhealthy lifestyle.
We again see the importance of the environment and the patterns of behavior that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity, almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19% of obese children ate fries for dinner on the eve of a survey related to an educational event called Obesity is not a coincidence.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports. This, however, applies to the majority of families of modern schoolchildren - only 15% of children said that their parents find time for sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last academic year and involved nearly 900 primary school students across Bohemia.
The event Obesity is not an accident was held for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company V<0xC5><0xA1>eobecn<0xC3><0xA1> zdravotn<0xC3><0xAD> poji<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC5><0xAF>ovna and the company Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils of 4-8 grades have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient exercise are the main determinants of a rapidly growing number of children who are either overweight or obese.
“For example, only half of the respondents said they eat five times a day, according to the breakfast-breakfast-lunch-breakfast-dinner scheme, and this is one of the unavoidable conditions of proper nutrition,” says one of the study’s findings.
No lunch and sausage in the evenings
Experts warn that even relative details such as the constant time of a family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren have breakfast together.
In most families, breakfast is served separately.
The worst discovery was that in every tenth family, people do not eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The study found that fried food is more commonly consumed in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet refreshments every day (70%).
Although more than 40 percent of children regularly play sports, this figure is more than doubled – up to 15 percent – when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu based on the proposed products and based on their tastes and preferences.
"Preferences in food in Czech children aged 12-15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
“Special concern is the high popularity of sweet soft drinks,” the study concludes.
As the main meal, the pasta defeated a bird with a small preponderance.
However, the children showed almost no interest in beans, fish and vegetable dishes.
Striving for a healthy lifestyle
The study also found that children were willing to change their eating habits provided they were provided with relevant information.
“Many participants in the study control group demonstrated a significant shift in preferences toward healthy food when they filled out a questionnaire after the end of the lecture Obesity is not a coincidence,” the project’s findings said.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet soft drinks - more children began to prefer them just water.
In addition, as the main dish, children more often noted the bird and fish, limiting the amount of sweet dishes and pastries.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article about training for stylists, I looked at the amount of information in introductory classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in this field; tips on choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how it all works in real life.
Further - more.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, (there are no men in the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other has a boy figure without proper shapes, another weighs more than normal.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce broad shoulders, lengthen the neck, or add missing volumes.
We were given tips on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, that is, the owners of more lush breasts and thighs and a narrow waist, and not to wear them too provocative.
For example, if the difference in waist and hip volume is so large that you can not pick up a skirt or pants, it is worth having at least one thing sewn to order.
You will clearly not regret the invested funds, since perfectly seated clothes are priceless.
In a skirt sewn to order, you will feel much better than in one that constantly goes down, rolls up, strips the waist, etc.
Owners of boys figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with ruches, appliques, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I’m glad I have a whole week to realize it all.
And yet, I'm afraid, it's too much, given the homework we've been given.
Each participant of the courses had to come up with two outfits for some celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothing and the type of figure.
I'm going to wear Miranda Kerr, which you may know from Victoria's Secret's advertising campaigns.
I’m happy about myself because it’s much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguilera, who has recently improved by a ton (please keep in mind that I’m exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We must cut clothes from magazines or find them on the Internet, print and process them with graphic programs.
Mudboard - so called the result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphical component of the style.
The stylist not only dresses real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, for example, fashion bags, coats, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us.
But it was only on Sunday.
The stylist needs general knowledge.
The Saturday lecture, full of information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests - specialists in this field.
Stylist, Honza Pokorny; fashion designer, Jakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn in the usual way, on top of jeans and T-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without fasteners, like a dress.
Another option is to roll up the sleeves or lift the collar, and the whole image completely changes.
“Play with him,” he said.
Anyway, I most appreciated the following advice: "For your work you should know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them," Jacob told us.
Here I finally understood why we’re going to tame all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see something completely different.
Not to mention the fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist should have more outfit options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a ten-page fashion review (equivalent to ten outfits) I should be willing to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that the item of clothing in the picture often looks and works in combination with others is not quite the same as in reality.
We have to keep this in mind when creating an image.
Honza Pokorny confirmed that often image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn’t have an amazing vocals, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude to the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often consider it superfluous (and believe that it is enough to be an expert in something, and how they look is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us a different (less) size than the one they actually wear.
Then we turn to Google and find out if the tabloids have written anything about some celebrity being overweight/weaned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it is not enough for a stylist to understand fashion and be able to pick up outfits.
Our work mainly consists of communicating with the people we dress; therefore it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to pretend to them and to stick to your opinion.
“If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can’t throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible.”
“Find at least a few things you can praise and advise what you can wear with them,” says Mario.
He also showed us what specifically should fit the work bag.
This is a bag that you tie around your waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, a sticky roller or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylists use it when shooting some items, such as a bag or a hat), special clips for fastening the fabric on the back.
In order to distract ourselves from the lectures and gain some practical experience, we learned to do the right linings on the soles of shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged - not to mention outdoor shooting.
So we did the sticker.
You should not touch the shoes with scissors so as not to spoil them.
It requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
These skills did not appeal to me.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend courses.
I’m starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn’t that easy, no matter what they say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Responsive
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning commute to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
Ambitions have been satisfied to some extent, but it doesn’t matter, as no one clearly wanted to do the overwork.
Before the release of the new version with the subtitle "Escape" was associated with great hopes.
It was expected to move the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; the demo versions showed that the game would take a dignified place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end a lot is different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is spoiled by a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So, in reality, this is not a mistake, but a manifestation of the inexplicable laziness of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You become part of the story, whose protagonist, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
This idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes place on its own route, individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
It doesn’t feel like the same thing happens in the game all the time.
Despite the fact that the schedule is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are nice to watch.
And yet the game does not evoke strong emotions.
Although driving a car through the desert, in the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the race from time to time brings to life an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert you get into a sandstorm, significantly reducing visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to get under the avalanche.
The individual races are pretty well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that is enough.
For a while you try to outrun several opponents (essentially a regular race); then you try to improve the time (the standard race with a timer); or you compete with one opponent.
In addition, from time to time you run into the police, which further complicates your task.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
It’s just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Although surprisingly, these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (just three to be exact).
In fact, it turns out that it’s good for the game because this property isn’t annoying; given all of the above, it’s one of the things that makes the game more enjoyable.
The racing model follows in the footsteps of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it can not be considered a disadvantage.
If you’re looking for real life imitation, you’ll have to look elsewhere.
And yet this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although better options can be found in the market.
So far, it's very good.
However, after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don’t expect complex transformations and collisions from such a game, but if you have no idea before you collide with an object, how your machine will behave, something is wrong.
Usually, by overtaking or passing cars in a dense stream, you sometimes slightly touch another machine. And yet sometimes in a practically similar situation, your machine starts to spin wildly.
Or it's crashed.
This is not so important thanks to the restart system, but it is enough to spoil the fun.
Reboots are arranged so that if you crash or go far off the track, the game brings you back to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you will have to start the race from the very beginning.
This is useful if something doesn’t work out, but you can’t completely rely on it.
Sometimes reboots are not enough, and you have to learn by heart a separate section of the race.
An important drawback of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be done in a certain way, otherwise you just won’t fit in.
In other cases, you encounter civilian cars in a specific location in the same configuration regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see your rival easily pass between two cars moving in the opposite direction, while when you are there, the cars are already located so that you either need to drive around them or slow down.
It doesn’t matter when you’re next to them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have other advantages.
During the game you discover several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent overtakes you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand in front of you no matter what.
The fact is that when it drives in front of you, it worsens your visibility, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and adrenaline-filled, but it is so obvious that it quickly begins to cause irritation.
Too bad, because despite the simple model of driving, the game is fun and sometimes so full of events that you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you.
It doesn’t matter what doesn’t make you miss – a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or anything else.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You need to keep track of the refueling along the way, because it is on them that your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars - for straight sections of the highway; and exotic super-sportsmen for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain tracks.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; this is a race on individual sections that you will learn during the game.
Here you earn for your personal business both medals and points, common for challenges and story modes.
Many options are available for a higher level of driving: from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the online Autolog feature, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here’s another flaw that’s hard to understand; it’s an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (let’s assume that that’s it) where you run the tracks in the dark (let’s assume that’s it).
Your speedometer shows the figures from 150 to 200 km/h (let’s assume that this is the case) when suddenly a subway train flies behind you, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For several days, our editors have been discussing whether no one really thought for a second during the creation of the game, or whether its creators really consider us such fools.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video sequence is mostly pleasant, sometimes even astounding.
Although it is a pity that in some critical moments the quality of the recording, sometimes quite strongly, is declining.
This is especially true for incidents with a large number of participants, where a good recording wouldn’t help you either.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the amateur.
To please as wide a youth audience as possible, the soundtrack "entered compositions from different styles"; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: Escape is rather messy.
If the game had avoided obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Either way, the game leaves a feeling of infinity.
Sure, it’s good fun, but be prepared for the flaws that will blind you as an airport spotlight.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
The Czechs have a reputation for being unwilling and skeptical of the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has caused significant differences between individual organizations.”
“I didn’t expect such a brutal war.”
"It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, calms down and all players get used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milena Vicenova began her lecture at the law school.
She demonstrated how much she adheres to her motto “Clear and open about Europe” in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so simply and clearly that many lecturers from the law faculty of the CU would be envious.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, critics said he was an ordinary gray office mouse who could not perform any role; I must say, everyone was amazed at how well he handled his role."
“He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven member countries at the same time, who is great at communicating with them and who has a clear idea of which direction the EU should be moving in.”
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?"; that is, as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union's policies with regard to countries such as China or India.
No one is going to ban our cheeses.
Vicenova continued to focus on a programme that is key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech Presidency a success in the past year.
The Czechs dealt with the impending financial crisis; they overcame the crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership summit.
She said that the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Currently, Czech representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing fermentation.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget needs to be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which less; all these issues are in the forthcoming programme.
The ambassador recalled the key slogans that she brought to Brussels: "About Europe, understandable language".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
As citizens can understand, people in Brussels are not trying to sell curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese varieties.
It is also going to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organisations.
Multi-speed Europe is our future
The ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered Euro-sceptics; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that this is due to several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful Czech Presidency, she noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary and a Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what's the meeting, the Visegrad group again?' and he's not even happy about it.'
In the future, the Vicenova Union expects mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policies of the member states.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, more realistic.
“We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone.”
“We have a Schengen zone and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time, it was said that countries that want to unite, while those that don’t want to can stay apart.”
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe,” Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all participating countries, and not only those in the euro area.
Brand History:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find the word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest is likely to be “long-lasting.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company’s longevity was laid down by its first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson-senior.
He believed in his motto that many world problems can be easily solved if people want to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant unfolded (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
What’s more, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a constant move towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more,” says Samuel J. Palmizano, current CEO of the company, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complicated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care as much as Batja in the Czech Republic—IMB employees were among the first American employees to have paid leave, employer insurance, an elegant uniform, and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors.
The same is true of IBM’s long-term relationship with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company has found brilliant application to talented people. It was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Consistent with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, according to which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; currently she is Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
In the last few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorming, during which many future innovations arise.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - the company employs about half a million people.
An organization with a good reputation
The strong position of the company in the business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
“From the outset, in terms of concept, IBM was more of an organization than a technology company,” Harvard Business School professor and author of the book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, told Economist.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” adds Joe Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the “Blue Giant,” as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most versatile technology company – developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services – from servers to nanotechnologies.
It owns the largest number of patents among all U.S. technology companies, with five of its employees receiving the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode and a floppy disk.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM became the second-largest technology company this year (first place at Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Forwards
Not all of its products appealed to customers and fit the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is determined by moving forward, you can’t emotionally be tied to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That’s why IBM easily lays the foundation on multiple platforms – if they don’t work, it abandons them.
This is different, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based and experiencing the crashes on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM’s core revenues come from services, with about one-fifth of each coming from computer programs and hardware.
While in 1990, with twice the capital, it was the strongest manufacturer of equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion in low-yield assets, at the same time investing $58 billion in the acquisition of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM followed the example of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM has not harmed the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM's stock price has risen by a record 120 percent; the company's net income has steadily risen.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, we can expect that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM's history: from a cheese knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name "Computation, Tabulation, Recording Corporation" was quite complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924. Originally, it was called the brand used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future of IBM were laid by the merger of four companies, whose history begins in the 1880s.
They possessed technologies such as the legendary "table clock", i.e., a clock that records the time when employees come and go from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Runlett Flint, who also headed the board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the director of a rival company, to help him run the company.
The CEO then pushed IBM’s founder into the shadows – Watson’s ideas remain the basis of an immovable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and sale of various equipment for the business – from cheese knives and meat cutters to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson’s leadership, revenue doubled to $9 million, and the company began large-scale expansion across all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later, his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his place as CEO.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM employees and computers helped NASA control space flights — to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 — a human flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM Line System/360.
The classic PC that defined the computer standards of the time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, at the same time buying the consulting branch PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus fully concentrating on consulting and services with high added value.
Over the past three years, IBM has achieved great success with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to use technology wisely in areas where it has not yet been planned, and to improve the road situation and urban management.
In the field of commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
The tradition of IBM is strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be located simultaneously in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-class research group on speech recognition also operates.
Judged by her unfaithful husband.
Yvette, leave a fool, I don't need it anymore!
Darina Rihtarzhova (53) said that everything is over!
After her husband Josef Richtarzh (53) became a bodyguard and lover of Yveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can go home, but not as my partner," Rihtarzhova explained.
When Darina Rihtarzhova provided Bartoshova’s home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Yvette to leave R<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>an 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly confessed that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to have reconciled herself to her husband's novel; and now she finally said goodbye to him.
I don't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Rihtarzh and Bartoshov ever parted, his wife would not accept him with open arms.
“He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him out.”
"But he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as the person with whom something connects me," said Richtarzhova, adding that she has already been freed from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph has nothing to do with his wife rejecting him.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not going to change that."
“My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision.”
"Our union is still functioning; I'm responsible for repairs, gardening, home and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly normally, only we no longer share a bed," Richter told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Rihtarzhova finds a new love, he will not interfere with her.
“We don’t sleep together, and I don’t care where she goes, who she’s with, or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I've fallen in love with Yvette and I'm fully responsible," Joseph concluded.
The Worst Habits of Women: Are They Affecting You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually list them all at once.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines describing several female habits that make men angry?
Category: Shopping
Is your partner complaining that you’re going to the store all the time?
Do you need to buy at least one item every week?
Do you like to shop at large retail outlets?
If so, then your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, who of you will refuse to walk around the clothes stores in search of perfectly sitting clothes and try it (preferably, in different color options) in sample?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men, it can be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait outside...
The Eternal Discontent
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
“Are you still attracted to me?”
Do you know these phrases?
- Yeah?
Then you belong to a group of women who are confused in their appearance.
Not that you need to stop following yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to constant complaints about their partner’s appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more often such complaints occur, the more women annoy them.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Wash glass, vacuum cleaner, floor wash, dust wipe, bath cleaning - at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for stepping on a clean tile in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on a window glass in the living room that was so hard to clean?
If you suffer from this “deviance,” try to realize that falling into extremes is not good; and that order and cleanliness in your family should not be the first place.
A harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationship as well as your entire family.
Desire to command
"Throw your clothes in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels for dishes should not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if men understood this, women would not have to command them so often...
Spletni
Some women like to gossip, insult, and twist intrigues against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
From time to time, each of us must be throwing up a gossip.
Let's be honest, that's the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossips, women who often gossip and despise others. They, especially in the women's working team, pose a great danger to their environment.
Jagr and Vorachek's successful broadcasts helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL game on Monday, two successful transfers of hockey forward Jaromir Jagr helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the Carolina ice. He again became the most successful Czech player of the match.
In both cases, Claude Giroud used the experience of a thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another transmission and was declared the best player of the match.
Two successful transmissions of the match also belonged to a player in the same team with Yagr Yakub Vorachek.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he had predicted a magnificent evening for Gira.
"I told him before the game that he would score a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel things like that," explained Jagr, after whose actions Giroud scored a goal at the first opportunity given by Flyers.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a "Czech mark".
Locking Harrickains Vorachek took possession of the washer and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap with a numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second half again led the Flyers.
Especially Giroud.
After the successful submission of Jagr, he scored the third goal; in the future his shot was transformed into the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I like to play with him.”
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he definitely is in the top three," Jagr said, praising his midfielder.
“I never thought I’d play a hockey player like him at the end of my career.
“It makes me happy.”
“I want to support him.”
“All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to help me, and now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Rutu and Dwyer's penalty, shortening the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger did a great job in our area."
"He hit the washer, I accelerated, and Reed moved to the far end."
"I aimed at him and I'm glad it worked," Vorachek described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the Montreal team of the Czech Yaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pachek did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to injury to the upper body.
Together with an experienced defender, the Canadians lost their two-point lead and lost 2:3 after a penalty shootout.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanets could not score during one of their attacks.
More than the lost points, the home coach was saddened by the large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
“We ended the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people.”
“However, we can’t do anything about it, we just have to accept it,” said Jacques Martin.
“The replacement for the replacement, it was amazing and we couldn’t resist.”
“We had to simplify the game, move the washer out of our zone.”
"What was our weak side," added defender P.K. Subban
After thirty attacks, Czech goalkeeper Onja Pavelets helped Winnipeg beat Tampa Bay 5-2.
The Jets' goals, which interrupted a five-match series of defeats, were scored by five different players.
The dynamics of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was strictly limited, travel agencies of the time mainly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, on holidays Czech tourists went to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which entailed significant restrictions on the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual trips to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation from that country was necessary; otherwise, an individual trip was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered trips to the West, but it was either necessary to stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or to have "good friends" at the agency.
And that's not all.
Currency permits were required for travel to the West and were not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without currency permission it was impossible to obtain cash (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most often the Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the appearance of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit remains to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
While before 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are no longer aware of is that until 1989 we could not freely visit the most popular Croatia today, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the need for a visa to the neighbouring countries of Western Europe was abolished. This gave rise to a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovaks could not get enough of traveling to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, as their income at the time was not enough for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring your own food (canned, salads, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech koruna. Decades later, our tourists can finally freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income increased, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights operated by charter airlines. Compared to the past, flights have now become incredibly cheap thanks to the ability to order wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all the developed countries of the world except the United States. This made our travels even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000. Great demand led to the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have been delivering Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter flights from the Czech Republic will be sent to twelve exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, occurred in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. canceled the visa requirement for Czech tourists. Our country has thus joined the most developed countries of the world forever.
For the first time in history in 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for vacations abroad, including their spending at the destination.
The General Assembly should elect the president, the threat of the path is returning
For about five months, Czech football has not had a president. There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Gasek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what election rules to follow.
Without this, the vote for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Jindrich Reich, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Paczlik are eager to lead Czech football.
Gasek left his post in June. As he left, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future.
However, the Gashek era has again plunged football into a dispute between two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
It became quite obvious on September 16, when it was necessary to elect a new president.
Delegates of the general assembly arrived in vain at the National House in Prague, Smikhov, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
No agreement was reached as to who had the right to vote in the general meeting - only the legal representatives or also the officials to whom the powers had been granted.
This moment has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law that representation based on the mandates granted is impossible.
Disputes over the rules of the election, however, continue.
The Executive Board also did not help much, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it was mainly concerned with this issue.
Opinions on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: how to move to the 3rd round and avoid the duck?
"The dispute is whether to follow established norms or find another model," says one of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R vice presidents Dushan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided for by the statute, the winner of the third round is the candidate who has received a lot of support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
It is argued that Moravia agrees on a compromise - to consider the winner of the election of the candidate with the largest number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that in the overall percentage, the winner must score at least two-thirds of the votes.
"However, the two previous rounds would then have lost their meaning; this would completely reject the concept of two chambers", Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments. He says it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing rules.
Surprisingly, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Paczlik agrees with his opinion, although it is estimated that the electoral rules determined by the statute are more favourable to Pelt than to other candidates.
"I would like the elections to be held as much as possible according to the statute."
“I want to avoid all sorts of representative stupidity, as at the previous general meeting,” says owner Victoria Pilsen, who is a candidate for the first time; and in his statements he mostly contradicted Pelt.
Pelt is optimistic.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nimburg; he also hopes that in the future the candidates will cooperate constructively.
"All the emotional fermentation will calm down after today's expected release of the national team in the European Championship."
"Football will again be on a happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," says the representative of Yablonetsa. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Reichl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous."
"It's not between representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
“This could cause another breakdown in the general meeting.”
“I hope common sense wins,” Reichl said.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, individual negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was to deliver, among others, vice-presidents Dalibor Kucher and Reichl to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction. They sought an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the venue of the replay match.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which is expected on Wednesday, could be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, would like the opposition parties in the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
Many things are at stake: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV with the new directorate of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Patslik enters the presidential fight because he does not see a suitable candidate
If before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of footballers Pilsen Tomasz Paclik would see a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements for the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even claim a high position.
“If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not take part in the fight.”
"But such a man has not yet been found," Paclik told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Patzlik’s motive for entering the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Yindrich Reich is to try to prevent Pelta, the alleged favorite of the elections, from entering the FACR administration.
Moreover, Paclick emphasizes that in the event of a victory, he will remain president only until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be taken by an experienced top manager who is not too attached to football life.
“I’ve talked to a few people you could have thought of.”
“It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that they don’t even want to have anything to do with Czech football at the moment.”
“I would like to change that opinion,” he said.
Currently, the main disagreement between Paclik and Pelta is related to the relationship of the latter with Roman Berbro, the president of the regional football association in Pilsen. Berbro is a man of contradictory reputation, who behind the scenes is known as an influential lobbyist, able to influence the voices of delegates all
Patzlik, therefore, considers it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more detrimental to football," Paclick said.
He hints at the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was recorded during a phone call during a corruption investigation; Pelta managed to avoid conviction.
“I don’t know what prestige Pelta’s victory would bring to football.”
"And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclick. He now does not mention his previous statement that he "will sell the club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president".
If Paclick wins on Thursday, he could envision working with Pelta in the future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclik supported before the general meeting in September, which ended in a fiasco.
He (Pelta) would have been the first to whom I would have addressed.
"He's very capable."
"I can present him at the head of the team."
"But he can't run the association."
"I also don't shy away from what I don't understand," said Paclik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judge brigade led by Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Patslik claims that he will risk running the association.
He refers to his experience managing private companies; since last summer he has managed the team of Pilsen, which with his help celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
“I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better.”
"To limit the influence of some groups of persons who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals council, which leads to disgusting situations," said Paclik. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to Sparta's director Daniel Krzetinsky.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money for sports from lottery fees.
“This is one of the key issues that a new president should address.”
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they have to clearly state where the money will go,” he said.
Patzlik does not consider his relationship with the club Pilsen a burden, although he argues that the president of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be independent.
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, and Reichl with Prague Dukla.
“It’s not the perfect option.”
"And yet I don't see the point in the hypocritical transfer of my shares of the club Pilsen to someone else, since I'm going to be back there in six months," says Paclick.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R rules that will avoid the Electoral Path
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for the new rules of the FACR in order to avoid disputes about the rules of the election in the future.
Before the negotiations in Nimburg on Thursday, the official of Yablonec remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the election fight will significantly distract from today's expected success of our football team.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelt promised that if he wins, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general meeting. The two-month delay could thus be useful for him to uphold his ideas about football in a broader context.
“People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
“They feel it’s time for someone to head the association,” says the man, mostly associated with the Yablonec club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the association’s executive committee.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
“Unfortunately, the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June.”
“If different forms of representation had not been accepted, we would have had a president from September,” Pelta said.
He referred to the rewriting of a key civil association document as a false target for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will take personal responsibility if this attempt proves unsuccessful."
“This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist,” Pelta says.
In addition, he says that he is not trying to stand out against rivals.
In the past, he has already stated that he can present his collaboration with Yingrich Reich, whom he appreciates for his legal education; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Paclick, who constantly criticized Pelt.
"He's been in football for more than a year and he's had some success."
“In any case, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by the methods of his election campaign.”
"Even so, some of them are now doubting his true identity," Pelta said of his competitor. Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his knowledge of football to be his main weapon, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team must represent the entire football team.
“I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian case or the aftermath of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Immediately after that, I would focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for the whole football," the forty-six-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of head of football would not result in the dismissal of staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of individual employees." This was his message to Strachov, where the prolonged period of inter-agency provokes clear nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios surrounding the planned general meeting, he believes that delegates will come to Nimburg on Thursday in no uncertain terms.
“If the only controversial question is how to hold elections in the third round, we can deal with it.”
“Football needs the confidence it can get only by finally choosing its leader,” says Pelta, who remains optimistic two days before the key day of his career.
Reichl promises that under his leadership FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will begin to work actively
If at the meeting on Thursday Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl, acting vice-president, becomes the president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association, according to rumors, will be dissatisfied.
Reichl promises that if he is elected, the time of hard work will come.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make members of the executive committee responsible for individual areas of football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the Bohemians; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money into football; and to continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gasek.
“As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole.”
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national team, professional football and youth football events.”
“This is not to say that I will do everything myself,” Reichl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I am a team player and I want to allocate the powers on the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area.”
“I’m carefully allocating the tasks so that in each of these segments, football has taken big steps forward.”
“It’s probably not going to appeal to a lot of people because it’s going to mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others,” he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement presumably made him doubt his candidacy.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if this makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks in my wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
“However, a lot of people have told me I shouldn’t give up or others will come.”
“It’s a trust that I can’t give up,” he said.
What’s more, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
“A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don’t want to overwrite it all.”
“There have been processes that can bring results in a few years, and I don’t want anyone else to stop them,” he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the Association could return to what it was before Gashek.
“I believe in a systematic approach, and that’s something that Mirek Pelt is unlikely to be competent for.”
“He is surrounded by people who would play football so that he would only be available to the elect.”
"I can be blamed for many things, but certainly not for subjectivity."
“I’m trying to be objective.”
"I want to make football accessible to everyone because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority," Reichl said.
Moreover, he refutes the accusations that he will only be the president of the Czech Republic.
“Although many people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue the fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Reichl said.
While the manager of the Plze<0xC5><0x88> Tomasz Paczlik entered the presidential fight, Reichl does not dare to evaluate his chances of victory.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes," Reichl said. To his successes he attributes the savings of tens of millions of kronor to the talks on unfavorable contracts.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was "excluded from the process of returning credit to Czech football", he considers another rival, Paclik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
“No one can doubt that he has done a great job in Pilsen this year.”
“If he is elected, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Gasek started, without significant personnel changes in the committees.”
“He wouldn’t distort the facts for his own benefit,” Reichl said of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the water
Yulia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can try out the incredible water of Europe - and relax the tired body in the jacuzzi after a city tour or walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Iris Meder could not do without one thing during her research trips for the past year and a half: without her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, sailed to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored swimming pools in the Art Nouveau style.
She hurried to add every pool she liked to her notebook – with important details about the building’s construction and history.
The historian of architecture, Meder, has surveyed more than 200 swimming pools – and has now gathered the impressions in his recently published book Badefreuden, which included everything from the public pools in Munich to the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and the “functions of swimming”.
Her "journey to the most unusual bathhouses in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited bathhouses in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland - and in one city in Hov<0xC3><0xAD>k, Luks.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in the water everything is different.
The only drawback is that swimmers should tolerate blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the tempting smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
“I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so horrible,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Spass in the pool and exquisite oils in the sauna - a health factor in baths is so significant, because, in the opinion of Meder, all the feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real eye-catcher if the builders take on that kind of work. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have a water surface."
“The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building.”
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles and trampolines.
The 190-page illustrated edition of Joys of Bathing contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases - and causes you to want to jump into the water.
Meder, a collector of reservoirs, discovered several outstanding specimens during a study in Hungary.
She discovered nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (Cave bath in Mishkolts-Tapolca) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a building built in the shape of a bottle (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Term<0xC3><0xA1>lfürdö in Yasberen), as well as magnificent tea
From the many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is a breathtaking view. You can see the whole of Zurich from the rooftop swimming pool or view the snow-capped Arlberg from the outdoor pool in St. Antony. And the steam room has a window that allows you to see.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits swimmers in the Langenfeld. The aqua cathedral in Ectal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In winter, a pair of three open sinks rise from it, which seem quite small against the background of the Ectal Mountains.
Alhambra in the Schwarzwald
The pool collector Meder did not meet the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell gray. The Arpad baths in Bekeschab smell so much of oil that it can be hard for you to believe that you are in a health source.
The odor is caused by hydrocarbons in alkaline water. The water is almost black from the sludge that sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool - a wellness experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at some point in her search for beautiful places to swim. When she tried to visit the open pool of Czech baths in Luga<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she found that the territory was sealed.
The bathrooms, designed by the architect Dushan Yurkovich in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked into the glazed views of the red-white-yellow building in the Art Nouveau style, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald – the Thermal Water Palace in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already passed through three stages of construction. You will find not only neo-Romanesque elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace - the favorite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it is native to Schwarzwald.
"This is a real achievement - so masterfully combine such different architectural styles," says Meder.
Diving into the thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary occupation.
Speculation of agro-industrial products
The Deutsche Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tives
Will the Deutsche Bank cease to trade in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann gave the task force the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for the poor around the world.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg City Hall
For German citizens, the situation is clear: According to one study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world’s poorest people.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented to Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report’s author, Harald Schumann, demonstrates that betting on world commodity exchanges raises prices – and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is directed directly against Deutsche Bank head Josef Ackermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade in the same way.
Initially, commodity rates were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand – and made a profit at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism. He promised to investigate the charges and said that no trade "is worth risking the Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation is due to be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors - with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes that follow the investigation in late January.
The trade in goods may decrease or stop altogether.
Ackermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch President Tilo Bode welcomed the news, stressing his critical attitude to the financial sector. “Bets on rising food prices are a blatant example of how thoughtless banks are currently acting against common interests.”
As the chief lobbyist of the bank, Ackermann has a certain duty, according to Bode.
"The Deutsche Bank should remove from its portfolio all investments that make money rates on food prices," Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s the starving people or the Deutsche Bank’s reputation.”
The quick reaction of Ackermann is surprising at first, but in the meantime the director would like to have a flawless image just a few months before the end of his stay in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not move to the supervisory board as planned.
Abolishing the controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also practically does not have to worry about the costs - with the consequences will have to deal with his successor.
One in two would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday. The study was conducted for the Forsa Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis on November 7 and 8, and 1001 people participated.
No more than eleven percent believe that investments that place a bet on the price of food are acceptable to the Deutsche Bank.
Many bank customers would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade. According to the study, every second would withdraw deposits that ultimately lead to commodity speculation.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st century house in Vienna
The Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Vinsovski
Architectural history with rises, falls and happy ending. The Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and was abandoned.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World’s Fair in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture with its simple shapes, glass halls, bold ones that expressed faith in technical progress.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix for architecture in 1958 for its lightweight floating steel and glass construction.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
In the end, it became famous around the world in 1973 for its legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and its sister – a bowl-shaped building.
The pavilion, designed as a building for temporary exhibitions, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna's South Station, converted and opened as a 20th-century museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th Century" for this reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it did not have walls on which to hang works of art, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition is getting worse and worse.
The architect Adolf Krishanitz has to date restored the pavilion, which was called the "House of the 21st century" and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is the branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening - in every sense a joyful event.
Agnes Husslein-Arko, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to the new venture.
Husslein-Arko, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a sculptor in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, has convinced politicians and custodians to continue the reconstruction.
The new museum was to accommodate the permanent exhibition of Fritz Votruba Foundation, a cafe and a bookshop along with modern art. An office building was also to be built.
Strict control & limited budget
Krishanitz was then an ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession by Josef Albrich, and won the competition, but he also studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him to attend exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and the tasks that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose during the last redevelopment were much more serious. The building was an "energy absorber", says Krishanitz.
Window profiles on the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade were replaced, fiberglass reinforced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with high-strength safety glass.
The steel linings of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors have created space for a new use of the building, a fallen light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a practically new building, but still an elegant Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The movie theater is the same as it used to be.
All this under strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
“We often had to find material that was good, cheap and would have been approved by the museum management,” says Krishanitz, pointing to uneven floors in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite constraints, problems and transformations.
Krishanitz recently noted that the pavilion "from Brussels" was rough - a typical story of a "drop in the city".
Such architecture “is not always in its place” and yet it wants to “stimulate real awareness”.
The house of the 21st century is in the very right place, because in the planning of the city happened unexpected luck. The completely redesigned "quarter of the main station" with offices and residential real estate grows around the Swiss Garden.
The house of the 21st century can be complemented by the second building of Krishanitz - the collector Franceska von Habsburg acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city about its location in the Swiss sadu.
Deutsche Bahn plans multi-million winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has unveiled an anti-crisis plan to avoid cancelling trains in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to the internal anti-crisis plan of Deutsche Bahn, the newspaper Bild reports that investments totalling about 300 million euros are planned by 2015.
The investments are designed to improve the performance of locomotives and the railway network, even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and engaged employees involved in snow removal from roads and platforms will be halved, to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice before the start of work and 90 percent of the necessary shooters in a period of four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of train cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger transport, as it lacked reserves at a time of deteriorating weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been awaiting approval by the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays with the supply of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also had to check the axles of ICE trains much more often for many years after one of the ICE trains broke the axle at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank to pay <0xC2><0xA3>million fine in U.S.
New troubles came after the turmoil around Josef Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a fine in the United States of many millions of pounds.
Like Deutsche Bank, there were few problems at home, the past of the industrial giant in the US has now driven it. The Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to settle the disputes that arose after the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The cost of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged down credit unions.
“We are pleased that we have resolved this issue without bringing the parties to justice,” said a representative of the Deutsche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not acknowledge its guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Mattz welcomed the swift response from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for losses that emanate from billions.
This is the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and filed a lawsuit in the summer against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Dubious mortgage bonds are so-called securities that are secured by a pool of mortgage loans.
They are supported by internal loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble burst in the U.S. real estate market in 2007.
The American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life on the brink of the financial crisis in September 2008.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still battling a storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a large number of claims demanding to pay compensation or punish fraudsters.
Behind the largest wave of claims is the Federal Agency for the Financing of Housing (FHFA).
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of having purchased approximately $200 billion in pledges from US credit institutions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Deutsche Bank is also facing the threat of prosecution by the FHFA for numerous agreements totaling $14.2 billion concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator demands that the bank, which is headquartered in Frankfurt, take responsibility for “substantial losses” but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank dismissed the claims as unfounded and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett Invests $10 Billion in IBM
Finance guru Buffett is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares totaling more than ten billion dollars.
So far, Warren Buffett has always said he doesn’t invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is hard to predict.
However, IBM’s annual report changed his mind about investing in the industry.
According to Buffett, he had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investments were seen as a chivalrous act.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now received the title of "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business channel CNBC, Buffett reported that since March, he has acquired IBM shares totaling $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has become one of the largest holders of IBM shares with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM did not know anything about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management that managed to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
For a considerable time, IBM has been focused on high-yield IT services such as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, which is now more than 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He said he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in mechanical engineering.
Its Berkshire Hathaway holding holds shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly the Municher Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the most expensive companies in the world on the basis of skillful investment.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible money-making instinct earned him the nickname “Oracle of Omaha.”
The price of IBM shares rose by one percent before the opening of markets after the announcement of Buffett’s investments.
The “blue giant,” as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend.
The Imminent Danger
After the discovery of a cell in Zwickau, Turkish media began to question the rule of law in Germany.
One of the newspapers speaks of a “blood ideology” that is now once again rising to the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have become a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community in Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has brought to life long-forgotten fears. There have been no such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks since the fires in Melbourne in November 1992 and in Sollingen in May 1993.
There was never any doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network now discovered has a scale that is not yet fully realized.
"Revival of Bloody Ideology?" was the headline of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret intelligence officer, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be drawn into a right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, citing victims of racial hatred with a silent picket across from the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral labour contract at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was like a prank. "Gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the name of one of the articles on the Turkish internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriyet also did not miss the opportunity to draw this parallel.
"It starts to smell bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulakhji.
He notes that people were killed who paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful raids were sharply criticized on German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities hadn’t thought about tracking suspects in right-wing extremist circles before.
Some authors have come to a rather sharp rhetoric. "If they continue to act as unwisely, migrants will have no choice but armed self-defense."
"It will be the best self-defense."
“The world in Germany depends very much on how the whole network is opened up and on the lawfulness of punishment,” Selen writes.
The crimes of the 1990s in Melinda and Sollingen were an example of the fact that the peace in Germany was under threat.
The photograph of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply imprinted in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks living here so clearly that they are in danger, and the Germans that distrust and indifference can result in real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of Turkish unity.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time mainly condemned the failure of the German police after the attacks. Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mellon.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the fires in Sollingen, but participation in the memorial ceremony in Cologne was accepted by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech counted the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It’s as if he’s determined the value of a person by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has once again shown how the distrust of many German Turks in the current German state has deepened since then.
He has made clear what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and reassess right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
The Banking Scandal at Lake Zurich
Most of Europe’s leading banks’ risky policies are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS has almost gone bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling with one crisis and another crisis ever since.
Now it is up to the German to get him back on the right track.
Alex Webber probably didn't know he was going to get this role.
In July, after his spectacular resignation as head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would start working in a no less spectacular position – Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career path.
Alex Weber was clearly thrilled, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newfound strength, and made a few friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has managed to change for the better."
“I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel.”
But in September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
UBS trader in London bypassed the bank’s security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grubel, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS is considered sick, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take up his post?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will take over as chairman of the board in May, not in 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Webber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He suddenly found himself responsible for the bank’s strategy, which once again proved that it had long earned the title of “the biggest banking scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, very large - until recently it managed the largest assets in the world - and on the other - for years does not come out of scandals.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank does not spare anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The bank has combined the image of a secretive and sustainable, but at the same time agile asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus having more money in the management of wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
and as an investment bank entered the league of the largest banks in the world.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking, a longtime lecturer at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: “I always brought my students UBS as a model of good banking.”
Knowing what we know now, you may ask, how could I have been so wrong?
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that there was something wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffley - who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker - suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment unit of the bank tried to play on substandard securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The bank has indeed managed to find investors – but investors, the services of which many bankers would have politely refused until recently – one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so secret that even its name was not disclosed.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got a lot worse.
The bank had to announce new billions in losses, and Marcel Ospell, Switzerland’s second-highest-wage CEO in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster occurred. Due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS faced the threat of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank bought toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with mandatory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of the fact that huge banks were established in a small country.
After all, UBS’s final balance sheet in 2007 was five times larger than all of Switzerland’s production (see chart).
“We won’t be able to save UBS a second time,” says bank analyst Geiger.
The second accident occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and said it was ready to pass on data to wealthy customers who may have been taxed with the help of the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursing unwarranted business income plus a fine.
UBS, therefore, more or less acknowledged that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in the fight for rich customers – the veil of secrecy.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The money of the customers has begun.
Over the past few months, the bank has lost confidence in both main areas of its activity – investment due to failed speculation and asset management as a result of aid and tax evasion.
And just calmed down and it seemed that UBS managed to reverse the situation, as happened this disaster with the scammer-trader. A single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment department is not working yet.
“The incident with Adobe has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The CFO of one of Germany’s largest banks also has no doubts: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t have a risk control tool.”
Caution has long made Swiss bankers custodians of the world's largest assets - not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, regardless of whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine republic or not.
Swiss bank safes have become a symbol of unwavering reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize a refined taste in chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still corresponds to the image of a decent Swiss private bank, only a little more.
Its location is a classic in itself.
The head office of the bank is located in Zurich on the Bankhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, surrounded by the snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are some of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli you can find such jewelry companies as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been located here for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace and elite private banks such as Julius Barr.
The heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls there are large leather sofas. Next to the emblem of the bank there is a large sign "Safe".
UBS knows that its customers need reliability.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned Swiss notions of banking – or, as the head of one of the smaller Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He wouldn’t want to see his name in the newspaper – like all Swiss bankers, he also collaborates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big – in particular, in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there's anything, it means they've long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it its first big profits - and then a fiasco. No other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money in the jungle of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“On Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the country’s history,” wrote Lucas Hessig in his book Crash UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly in the amount of UBS.
Two of Switzerland’s three largest banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This was helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a rich but graduated bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin the all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with UBS’ growth: Peter Wolffley, CEO of UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospell, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wolffley and Ospell were a dream team,” says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
“Wolfley, an outstanding intellectual, humble and deeply understanding of models and statistics, and Ospell, with his inner instinct, has gone all the way up, starting with an intern at the bank.”
But Ospell eventually relied on Wolffly.
And Wolffly could have made a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember well the meetings of members of the board, at which Wolffly always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he headed the "turning table", where the successes of the banks were contributed.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make a part of this journey.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities trading.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot. According to the parameter, which in banking terminology is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS has had failures in U.S. mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost him his life.
Striving for growth, the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in American substandard securities.
This evolved into a large mechanism that combined securities based on U.S. mortgages and sold them onwards — continuing to carry risks on its own.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
“UBS bought until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire,” says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the rise, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to put the bank in order proved more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts at UBS have become a children’s game with chairs and remain unreliable to this day.
In front of anyone who will lead this huge bank, there is an almost impossible task.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Geiger’s banking analyst already has the idea of giving up investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting about his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not (yet) ready to go that far.
However, it is obvious that investment activities need to be significantly squeezed.
The new head of the bank Sergio Ermotti plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually only seen as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with its predecessor, Grubel.
In the past, he has been able to show his character and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, he heads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to bring the investment bank back to what it was in the mid-1990s.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a development concept.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
Axel Weber is probably asking himself these questions.
In public, he has so far only said that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe drag down U.S. stock exchange
The looming recession in Europe worsened the mood of US investors earlier this week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not have much effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has dampened hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the embryo.
The general relief following the changes of government in Rome and Athens was not reinforced.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half-full, not half-empty — but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index closed at 12,078 with a drop of 0.6 percent.
The market barometer in the course of trading ranged between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, falling by one percent.
The Nasdaq Tech Index lost 0.8 percent, trading at 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 percent, closing at 5985 points.
Industry in 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced production and is adapting to the end of growth.
Eurostat’s statistical service reported that in September, the companies produced two percent less than in the previous month.
“We’re not on the island, we’re dependent on them,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe is unlikely to quickly shake the recession and that banks are showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these fears. In an interview with CNBC, he said it was not yet clear whether Europe was strong enough to do whatever it took to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his opinion, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffett threw the decades-old principle into the trash and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM of more than ten billion dollars raised the stock price of the oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The shares closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.
Buffett said he paid an average of $170 per share and now has a stake of 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathway fell 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted into cash almost all of its remaining share of the Construction Bank of China, disbursing $6.6 billion.
The bank mainly plans to maintain its capital ratio with net profit from the sale in order to comply with stricter regulations.

The shares of 719 companies grew, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.
The shares of 630 companies ended trading with growth, a fall of 1913 and 82 remained at the same level on the Nasdaq with a turnover of 1.38 billion shares.
Clever Crows Fill Cities
Gamers are considered problem birds in many places. Experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to be driven out of cities.
Some love birds, others would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents complaining of dirt and noise are becoming more and more in many settlements.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, is far from being achieved.
At the first raven symposium in the East Frisian city of Lear, experts argued that players could no longer be driven out of cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Finding alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that the root of the problem in cities was in the migration of specially guarded toys, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction, and cutting down traditional nesting trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under guard.
In the town of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west in Jever, Dipholz, Ahime under Bremen and Lere there are large colonies, numbering more than 600 parent couples.
The ambiguous project of shooting crows in Lera caused disapproving newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described catching birds in traps and stabbing them with sticks as a particular cruelty.
“Normal movement and intimidation don’t do anything,” said architect and landscape designer Werner Claver of Lera.
Breaking down nests by a jet of water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals disperse, and large colonies divide and spread to other areas."
Intimidation is possible only in the form of exclusions near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We will have to live with them. Get rid of them is not an option."
Apart from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says the mayor of Lera Wolfgang Keller.
A combination of deterring birds from those in need of protection in residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be an option.
"Information stands instead of chainsaws" was the slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be confident in ourselves to live with this problem".
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational raven route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information about the lives of highly intelligent players is given on the information stands.
The project is already attracting tourists.
Jürgens also expressed her opinion on the complaints about the noise made by birds. "Noise conveys a lot of information. They have a lot to say to each other."
The mind and whims of these birds have become legends. Players often not only use the tools to take possession of the glimpse of the piece, but also make the tools themselves.
Behavior researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested the measure of the bird’s mind on four wheels.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that it was necessary to knock on a board to get a moth larva.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the board.
In another experiment, intelligent players had to solve a more complex problem.
The researchers put a small bucket of moth larva into a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not get the prey with a snail.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make hooks and used hooks to grab the bucket by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four players have done this since the first attempt.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to Euro 2012 <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for victory at the last minute were not long lasting.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took last place in the Euro 2012 championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the leadership of superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina with a score of 6:2 (2:1), perfecting their fifth Euro exit after 0:0 in the first leg.
Czechoslovakia had enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of the playoffs against Montenegro after a clean win in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss their chance by playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Posthiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the remaining goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvezdan Misimovic and captain Emir Spahic reduced the gap by two points thanks to a successful penalty in the 41st minute and a goal in the 65th for Bosnia.
Sena Lulich received a second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Portugal has already knocked Bosnia out of the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa.
Portugal made a great start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo took an early start, giving a free kick to the goal from about 30 meters.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-distance skills, increasing the score from a 25-meter mark to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not open the account in the first half hour, got their first chance thanks to attacking Edin Jacko.
The former Wolfsburg player from the leader of the English championship Manchester City in the 33rd minute sent the ball head to the bottom of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line.
Ira<0xC4><0x8D>ek scores for Czech Republic
Then in the spotlight was Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
Following the attack on Alder Posthig at the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was simulating, and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded the dubious penalties for playing by hand after the foul Fabiu Quentran - Misimovi<0xC4><0x87> implemented it.
After the 2004 break, the European champions tied the score with four more goals.
Peter Yira<0xC4><0x8D>ek dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The European champions of 1976 go to the European Championships for the fifth time in a row.
Success also smiled at the team of coach Michael Bilek and the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlet (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake in the very beginning that could be catastrophic.
The goalkeeper Petr Chekh in the 9th minute thanks to an instant reflex prevented the potential goal of Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Sivok.
The best chances for Montenegro were when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were on the field.
Damjanovich struck from the end of the penalty area in the 40th minute and almost scored the goal of Chekhov.
After the break of the pole, she saved the already shaken world-class goalkeeper of the Czech Republic after the forward of FC Seoul left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after a 0:3 loss in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than a 0:0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is now virtually no doubt that national coach Gus Hiddink will now clear the bench of the team, which reached third place in 2002, the Croats are in the final round of the European Championship for the fourth time.
The Turks were almost perfectly able to start in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir stadium.
The long shot of Seljuk Inan in the seventh minute hit the rack, and the attacker Kazym Kazym failed to strike the ball into the net.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly seized control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
Bundesliga legionnaires Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Mandjukic of the Wolfsburg team, who gave way to Ivan Perishich of Dortmund for the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is going to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro exit after Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team - who already looked confident in their place after winning 4-0 in the first leg - took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to the goal of Stephen Ward.
Konstantin Vasilyev from the guest team compared the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good tempo from the start, but only in the 23rd minute did Robbie Keane from Los Angeles make the first clean goal.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from bringing Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Bypassing goalkeeper Paul Londak's defense, Ward was in the right place and, dropping the ball across the line, changed the score by 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software producer, SAP, plans to invest billions and nearly double the number of its employees in China over the next few years.
The company, which is on the Dax list, said on Thursday that it is going to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
“We will create more opportunities for research and development and employ thousands of people,” said Bill McDermott, one of SAP’s executive directors, at a consumer show in Beijing.
The state of 2,500 people should grow to 4,500.
The world market leader in industrial software plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
In this country, which is experiencing an economic boom, there are about 4,000 SAP customers out of more than 176,000 worldwide.
China’s growth forecast is an important component of the company’s 2015 strategy, which is listed on the Dax list.
SAP plans to increase sales to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the company from Waldorf earned about 12.5 billion euros.
The software provider business, with 55,000 employees worldwide, looks better than ever.
SAP has been in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to change the scale of our operations,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on informatization in China.”
Mass murder is a human dimension.
An intense and very good new book by Peter Englund, Beauty and Grief: A Personal History of the First World War, begins with a long list of actors from whom the heart is dying.
Here’s a tip on how to read on: Carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund tells them, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon, when, like one of these men and women, you get off the road and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as "a work on anti-history."
It has few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, clever journalists, or discussions of tactics and combat equipment.
It's not so much a book about what it was, he explains, as a "book about what it looked like." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and the state of mind."
Beauty and Sorrow brought together 20 years of military experience of more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanical scientists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and servants.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone gets captured, loses an arm or leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives flicker here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some at this time will be extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
It is also an amendment to the notion that the First World War was only a heavy trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skilfully gives a panorama of other theaters of hostilities: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are bee hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is the cece flies.
This is an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of smokeless dust.
When a cannon is heard nearby and you are a woman and you are at home with the children, will you stay in place or run away?
Anyway, who's going?
Almost no one understands what is happening and why it is necessary to fight in this war.
“The lack of facts,” notes Mr. Englund, “is filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
Beauty and Grief traces the fate of people like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German Open Sea Fleet.
Their stories are mainly taken from memoirs, letters, and other materials already published.
The stories of their lives may be frightening or exciting, but they are most vivid thanks to the small moments and fragmentary details collected by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with it.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, Erzac everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about Erzac food in Germany.
He describes "meat of pressed rice boiled in lamb fat (and decorated with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; shoes beaten with wood".
He notes that there were “837 registered meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausage, 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories tell of honor and courage.
One American notices in himself a craving for cruelty and says about the war: "You feel that, in the end, this is what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a bestseller and claim that this show is under the ruthless and ruthless.
The British soldier, on the contrary, notes that he is likely to die and no one will notice it or be saddened.
“When a person is humbled by the thought of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen in front of the public,” he writes.
But on the contrary, it is scary to look like a "convicted man who is secretly hanged."
Other comments concern the old Europe, which is collapsing, and new kinds of fear.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war of factories.”
He notes the arrival of what he calls “the new species in the bestiary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressive and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-stitched suit who settles the slaughter while sitting at a desk.”
People act in an unforeseen way: low actions are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke of the soldiers who tried in every possible way to take venereal disease from the prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhea, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting into the hospital,” he writes.
"The very desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which often led to lifelong blindness."
Translated from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose is flexible but nebulous, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war “liberated completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich-Maria Remarque's "On the Western Front Without Change", rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this non-standard pantheon.
His book has the most stunning ending I can remember in non-artistic literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he reached out from the book to a page with a list of characters, grabbed it from your hands and burned it with a match.
After the previous error - a carefully calculated raid
The operation involved hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets.
The night time from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zukotti Park was supposed to have the least number of people at that time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few high-ranking officers, the rest of whom were initially told they were going to the drills.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the event, and his presence underscored the importance of the Department of Police.
There could not be a repetition of such episodes in recent weeks as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which contradicted the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation to free Zukotti Park protesters began.
The authorities were preparing, watching as the occupations unfolded in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on Randels Island, with Zukotti in mind.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot trainings - counter-terrorism measures that provide for the rapid movement of large numbers of police - referring to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute", - said a source familiar with the orders, in which the task was mentioned only as "training".
“The few cops I know who were summoned for the case were not told they were being sent to Zukotti Park,” said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
“The only people who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were in the highest positions in the department.”
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, the authorities wanted to clean up the park, but retreated in front of hundreds of protesters who swarmed inside before the scheduled time, having heard about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved staff from various police units, including forces from districts, a team of police officers who were usually used to control the criminal neighborhood.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and go from the park during the day, which makes 1 hour of the night a suitable time for the offensive.
“It was the right thing to do when there are the least people in the park,” he said.
Rescue machines with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pike-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drives, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The spotlights and pre-recorded announcements carried from loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When officers of administrative units entered the park in their blue windmills, many of the protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
Police said the tents did not touch until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other groups of police, according to eyewitnesses, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a spokesman for the head of the Police Department, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police were acting, and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said the cars with the cameras on Church Street, along the park's western border, could have taken the picture.
When police went west through a pile of protesters’ personal belongings, including bags, plastic mats and plastic bags, full of clothes, teams from the Sanitary Department followed her, collecting what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were pulled out, photos of which soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the kitchen of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police entered, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp clasped their hands together.
And two men tied themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
To cut the locks, rescue workers were called.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
The clean-up operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr. Brown said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “violation of public order and resistance to detention,” he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the police search department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead the operation," Mr. Brown said.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, in case you needed to get inside.
The fences were laid on Courtland Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw how from these positions the police extended the perimeter even further beyond the borders of Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, pushing people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped onto the roof of a police car, and others, according to eyewitnesses, released air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
Union of service staff of schools will sue the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, saying layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students are studying.
The trial is probably the last means available to the union of the district council 37, trying to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, coordinators of work with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their places on October 7 as a result of what the union's leaders called a political reaction to the union's budgets to give the city access to the medical fund.
City officials categorically denied the accusation.
At hearings in the City Council last month, Chancellor of Schools Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One member of the council parroted, telling him that nowhere in the budget was there any indication that the auxiliary staff of the schools would be fired.
Representatives of the 37th District Council reported that they had filed a notice of claims, warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal filing of the suit in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The plaintiffs will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Urban Education and list eight temporary dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, as well as most assistants who have lost their places.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint, which was made available to the New York Times, the union focused on a number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that the poor schools have lost more money.
He points out that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island, and there were few in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 auxiliary school workers lost seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave for Districts 8 and 9 in the South.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at 36 Free High School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill budget gaps.”
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way of calculating additional funding for every poor student who enters school.
The trade union also claims that school principals may have been misled in the language of the notice authorizing the dismissal of coordinators for work with parents.
The notification used the word "excess", although "excess" is more often said when a teacher from the school's payroll moves to the list of existing employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six coordinators for working with parents were fired,” the lawsuit says, “and not just translated.”
The mission is over, Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is due to consider a resolution tabled by Chairman John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph E. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), who commends
"The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
“This is a confirmation of the support of their democratic aspirations on the part of both parties.”
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion of Libya has been easy yet.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a significant majority of both parties and never received a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for the US operation in Libya.
This has left the American mission in a kind of legislative purge — when Congress is irritated enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not bad enough to really knock the ground out of it.
Then the events overcame the indecisiveness of Congress
In August, Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels, and on October 20 Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
The Senate may now be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "delights the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary perseverance in the pursuit of freedom" and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who have participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people and are professionally engaged in the defense of the Libyan people for their integrity.
The resolution also "affirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measures get the full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or will it split legislators like the June bill?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the Republican leader on the Committee.
Luger's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, this week’s House of Representatives is expected to vote for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for nearly every Republican and some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by House Member Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), would be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary vote of Congress on this convocation.
Other legislators have not yet succeeded in bringing their amendments to the plenary session, but not because they have not tried.
The Gudlat Amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that address a wide range of issues that have been introduced in this call.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the Balanced Budget Amendments in the House of Representatives alone, and more on “control over federal spending.”
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors – mostly newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their resumes – the opportunity to boast that they have “proposed” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote for the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of members of Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives Jose Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to abolish the two-term limit for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as has another one prohibiting the burning of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states object to them.
As much as members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are moving forward no faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislature proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th it made 66.
This rate is dim compared to the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment that was passed - the 27th - was approved in 1992, but introduced to Congress it was actually in 1789.
“Beaten but not defeated,” Giffords says in his first television interview after the assassination attempt
Ten months after an armed man shot at her in focus at a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) on Monday evening appeared on the federal channel and said that the song from the Broadway sho.
Having appeared on the 20/20 BBC News with Diane Sawyer, Giffords had a hard time formulating suggestions and needed help walking.
The program showed her a difficult path of recovery after a bullet wound that shredded the skull and pierced the left side of the brain, passing from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the bill on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview after a January shooting that killed six and wounded 13 people, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang—and called her recovery “difficult.”
When asked how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords replied, “Very well.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly special "20/20", which was shown on the eve of the release of the new book by the spouses "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope".
The special issue talked about the restoration of Giffords after the shooting on January 8.
In a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is lying on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair and physiotherapists teaching her how to perform simple actions.
Nod your head.
Get your lips out.
And then her first word: "What."
A few days later, Giffords uttered a second word - "toast", a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by the BBC shows that music played a central role in Giffords’ recovery: we see the congressman singing along with the doctors of “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” by Cindy Loper and “Free Fall” by Tom Petty.
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she doesn’t remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband told her that he was reading a Giffords article in the newspaper about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed then.
Suspected assailant Jerdy Lee Lafner is held in a Missouri prison and undergoes forced treatment pending trial.
“A lot of people have been killed,” Giffords Sawyer said.
"Heavy, heavy, heavy."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, “I’m defeated.”
"And I said, 'Gabby, you're not defeated,'" Kelly said.
You're just beaten.
And you'll go through it, you'll recover and come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a holiday on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment, and loss.
On the signal several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines lined up around him.
The audience in their tuxedos applauded him standing.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Salzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, who was also the then Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were treated like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
Completely opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has established itself between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public.
Soldiers are being praised for their sacrifices.
But praise has its price, say the soldiers.
The public increasingly behaves as if they are feeling pity for people in shape.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon leaving for Afghanistan.
“But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us like the unfortunate.”
It’s a sensitive topic for military leaders who don’t want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger faced by returning troops in the recent years of the Vietnam War has been far worse.
As a result, most of the talk about pity is quiet and only between combat veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat in the Marine Corps, retired colonel Mark Canshne warned them that the non-army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration because they thundered the rebels and went to exotic places.
Others will wonder if there is "a cruel evil veteran under the guise of hiding," said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and, on his return, held a senior government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he says, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could withstand the stress of responsible work in Washington immediately after the campaign.
Kenshn recalls how he told his sons, “When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect.”
The awkwardness experienced by the military partly stems from the American indifference to wars.
Victories on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that is little familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism the way it used to be in World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Bernow, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public mainly focuses on the depth of the soldier's suffering.
Troops are estimated by the number of expeditions they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost, or by the scale of losses.
The army is facing increasing pressure from proponents of the fight against rape
This week's historic court hearings will decide whether to accept a lawsuit against the army of 28 men and women on the charge of non-counterfeiting rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the following.
Elizabeth Lyman, a straight first-class woman, aged 25 and 11 weeks pregnant, was allegedly raped by her coworker at night.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after a dinner with a friend and met a male coworker carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could come to her room for a drink.
“It was a red flag,” Lyman says.
But the Texas native has taken away her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
“I’m sorry I didn’t follow my instincts.”
A few minutes after they entered Lyman’s room, a man approached her from behind, knocked her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be eagerly awaiting the court’s decision at a historic hearing that will be held in Arlington, Virginia, and will decide whether to go to court before a lawsuit they filed against his former defense minister Robert Gault.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld were unable to cope with widespread violence in the military in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit filed in February by lawyer Susan Burke from Washington, D.C., initially included 17 plaintiffs, but rose to 28 for the following months - 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or threatened with sexual violence by a co-worker, and that the arm
Burke says she targeted the top ranks of the army because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Burke also says she has been contacted by about 400 other victims since February, many of whom may be involved in future searches.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak - she will open a lot of things if needed to maintain pressure.
A defense team from the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to terminate the case.
Judicial documents obtained by Newsweek reveal a defense strategy – mainly that former or current soldiers cannot make claims to the army for damages suffered in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine mentioned in the 1950 Supreme Court ruling by the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons serving in the military.
"The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs," the documents said.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the story.
Since the 1950s, the situation has changed.
Although women are still officially forbidden to participate in the battle, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldier teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the combat zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers were killed between the two wars, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the military to become modern, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her lawsuit, three others are being prepared.
At Yale Law School, a Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a hateful atmosphere for women.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Vietnam is preparing a lawsuit against an army centered on diagnoses of “personality changes” that are put on victims of violence to remove them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the women’s rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Office of Veterans Affairs in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices to consider applications for pensions from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual violence during service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence Service of the Ministry of Trafficking, 3,158 attempted rapes were reported.
But, as you know, attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure is about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases reached the court - twice as many as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case call the attacks on them only the first in a series of other injuries.
In Lyman’s case, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell details of the rape 11 times separately to the fiancée of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive characterization to the accused, who was ultimately acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” says Lyman.
"I thought I was giving birth right now - I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember my commander saying, 'It wasn't a trial for him, it was a trial for me.'"
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with an unfavourable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Lyman and her fellow plaintiffs is a complex question, says John Terley, a professor of law at George Washington University’s law school.
However, he notes: “In my opinion, they are in a position to move forward.”
Between them and the verdict stands the doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I have been criticizing the Feres Doctrine all my life.
The army has lagged behind for decades because it lacks the incentives and deterrents it imposes on responsibility.
He adds: “Chances are very much against them ... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight with the army on this issue until there is reform,” she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens sooner.
The Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breivik was an ordinary guy exposing his anti-immigration views online.
Breivik, who confessed to committing a mass murder in Norway in July that claimed the lives of 77 people, appeared at his first open court hearing on Monday.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was far from alone on the web: he spent a lot of time preparing for an attack on his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
It's easy - you just have to go to Facebook.
“We realized that it’s not hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European cyber-populism at the British DEMOS Research Centre.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use the site’s advertising tool to single out the necessary demographic with scientific accuracy — that marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then pitched them an ad, but instead of showing a new group or a diet product, the ad offered the user a survey that asked questions about their education level, attitudes to violence, and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 members of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – even without leaving the office.
“It’s a completely new way of doing research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not so striking: online supporters of right-wing groups - most often young men, dissatisfied with immigration.
But unexpectedly, “those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who just hide behind a monitor.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything in the world – from health issues to social trends that are expressed in Likes, wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook’s “super-actual information” is causing a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles titled the site by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it provides an opportunity to study people who can’t be approached on the street with a notebook.
“In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to join the party and they would never have accepted you,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook eliminates all of this – you address them directly.”
Others say that through this site it would be possible to identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunk exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who remained silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students’ peers, such as their dormitory mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drunk statuses.
“You can’t solve the problem without identifying it,” said Dimitri Christokis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
"We have found a way to identify children from a risk group that we would not have otherwise detected."
Facebook also constantly retrieves various types of data about its users.
The data processing team of the site processed the statistics of the status of relations and Valentine's Day, the turnout of voters in the middle of the term in 2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (using mainly information that only they have access to - the champions of cyber freedom have long insisted on the generalization of the data).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrubble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined norms for conducting offline research, online data is publicly available.
“I don’t think a lot of users have even thought about the fact that a researcher can monitor their profiles,” says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a study he conducted in 2006 using public student pages on Facebook.
“As far as they could tell, it was just between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that the object of the study is extremely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how much information in the profile and on the user’s page is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selvin says.
That’s why, despite years of work in technology research, Selvin thinks notebook and pen are still the best research tools out of those that can be used.
“Nothing can replace going out into the real world and communicating with real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social, and most of the social research is still happening offline.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Bering Breivik will appear in public for the first time
Anders Bering Breivik, a man who confessed to organising a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance fighter” during his first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway," he said in front of 500 people in the courtroom.
“I object to the court because you got your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I admit the actions, but I don’t admit the guilt.”
Judge Torkel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech with him, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, barred him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept under lockdown.
They all came to find answers to their questions.
“I thought he looked cold and inhumane,” one of the survivors told Norwegian channel NRK.
“It was uncomfortable, but I personally felt a little lighter after I saw and heard the suspect.”
Breivik, dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, maintained calm and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange idea that he was part of a large “resistance” movement, the judge ruled he was not insane and said there was no evidence that he had acted with accomplices.
Some may reassure that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation is now feeling.
“I would like him to look like a monster, but that’s not the case,” said a relative of one of the victims.
“It would have been much easier if it had been that way.”
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs' Missing Interview Shown in Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans may consider the biggest discovery in a recently-discovered interview that they remembered in anticipation of preliminary shows in major markets this week is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a keen organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from “the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea is a great deal of work and a great product is separated from a huge amount of work.”
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the television series Triumph of the Nerds about the advent of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique lengthy conversation.
By that time, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was kicked out of Apple, and he had already worked at his new computer company NeXT in anticipation of the massive development of the Internet.
While a small portion of Kringly’s interview was used in the Nerds, he says the originals of the interview were missing during transportation.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a complete VHS copy was found in the director’s garage.
This footage, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which airs at Landmark Theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusually willing to lay out his technology philosophy and business strategy here.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different moments during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers - reflections of 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say the exact same thing.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by Kringle’s questions, causing him to move faster to questions or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar era, the iPods and iPhones Lost interview is something sinisterly prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about the posthumous assessments of Jobs' work, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, an alarming dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he said it all here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All the time in business, I've been asking, 'Why are you doing this?' And the answers you always get are, 'Oh, that's just how it's done.'
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks in business very deeply.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to streamline reporting at Apple.
Disturbed by the way of recording expenses, often starting with “standard expenses” that were taken off the ceiling and then adjusted using “add-on”, he created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business expenses down to the smallest detail.
A joke about the Pope:
Jobs details the “blue box” he made with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and call long distances for free.
A lot has been written about the device before, but Jobs’ euphoria here when describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a phone machine, ordering a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until as many stations as possible were connected.
“We’ve covered the globe half a dozen times and you’ve been yelling at the phone machine, and it broke into the neighboring phone machine a minute later,” Jobs says with a smile.
“We were young, and all we learned was that we could fabricate something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us knew a little bit, but we could craft a little thing that could control a big thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple could ever have appeared without it.
Jobs goes on to describe in detail one famous invention, which he and Wozniak practically managed by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope to call, trying his best to copy Henry Kissinger.
When different members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was picked up to answer the phone.
On the love of technology (and the cold name of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to assemble the frequency meter, he found Bill Hulett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees visiting the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the very first desktop computer.”
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an electron beam tube, and I fell in love with him.
I often went to HP when I was a teenager and I circled around that car and wrote programs for it.
About Improvised Innovation:
In several interviews, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of mounting plates, one buyer asked him to assemble an entire computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think about assembling and delivering ready-made devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced while developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the furious arguments ... they were screaming at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300] and I was full of it and I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
The big companies that are losing energy:
Long before he headed Apple’s renaissance, Jobs accurately predicted how many industry leaders were mistaken in seeing the situation and would lose control of their market share.
“Suppose you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copy or printer, and what?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who eventually come to lead companies, and the people who make the product are pushed out of the decision-making platform.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is being pushed out by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products – the skill required.
This is what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
It could have been 10 times bigger, it could have been Microsoft in the 90s.
They were defeated by victory.
Innovation as an art form:
“A great idea is separated from a great product by a huge amount of skill ... when you spin a great idea, it changes and grows.”
You will learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises you need to make – some things you won’t be able to make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head – these concepts – connecting them all together.
Ultimately, it all boils down to taste — it all boils down to trying to express yourself in the best that people have ever produced, and later — trying to bring that to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to become the best IT specialists in the world.
If it weren’t for information technology, they’d be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with opponents of the health care law while the court examines the case
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically contentious issue of whether he would listen to President Obama’s health care bill deferred, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were honored for a lunch sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case.
The case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions submitted for consideration.
One of the issues on the agenda was a petition backed by 26 states challenging the urgent health review passed by Congress last year, a law that united conservative activists across the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the trial; in fact, a 5-and-a-half-hour turnaround is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an impediment to the presidential race, which will be at its height by the time the verdict is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the health care law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was the deputy attorney general during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual luncheon of the Society of Federalists, a long-standing group that consistently upholds conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
The lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court’s hearing.
Among others, Mitch McConnell, a Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the health care law, was present.
Honorary guests for dinner, Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the events of the Society of Federalists for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical norms.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they had obeyed, they might have fallen under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “A judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a speaker, honorary guest, or mentioned in the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia and Thomas’s apparent closeness to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
“This stunning violation of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains true to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the General Court.
“The judges drank and dine at an official fundraising event with lawyers whose cases are now being tried in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for the event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to confuse the cases of the court with groups like the Society of Federalists.
And Thomas's wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that it is judge Elena Kagan who raises an ethical question, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal officer in the Obama administration when the first injunctions against the law were filed at the first inquest court level.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan hasn't shown anything she's going to do.
Boeing Receives a Record $18 Billion Order for Aircraft
Emirates is ordering 50 wide-body Boeing 777s and may be ordering 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal - more than $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft builder, and the price tag for all these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
Equally important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
This weekend, Boeing announced its largest order in the dollar equivalent for commercial aircraft - 50 two-way Boeing 777 aircraft.
An incredible order came from the airline Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft that will raise the total price tag to $26 billion, Boeing said at the Dubai Airshow in 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing said, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliners, which boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The price tag for six planes will be more than $1 billion.
“It’s really very good for Boeing,” said Morningstar analyst Neil Diora.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but also the rising fuel prices, which usually hurt airlines, as this is one of their biggest spending items, are not so devastating because the country makes money on high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel the order of the planes when prices rise, Diora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps prevent rival Airbus SAS from invading its dominance with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the airshow came four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which rivals just the 777-300ER.
He postponed his debut to increase the axial load after buyers demanded an increase in lifting capacity and flight range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently, lost in the elections in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n claims that the drug dealers helped the opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister seems to have failed to make her bid for governor Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n’s place during the fierce state elections, and she said on Monday that drug dealers helped tip the race in favor of one of her adversaries.
According to preliminary results, the leader of the race for the post of governor of the western state is called Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
"The interference of organized crime during the entire election process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for the whole country," Maria Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n said in a radio interview the day after Sunday's vote.
“They intimidated our candidates, our workers in the election... They grabbed the ballot boxes, set up obstacles... and made people vote” for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
It is preparing for a return, and the victory at Mitshoakan is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only slightly overtaken Calderon, who led the ratings until election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or PND, led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DPR, which now holds the governor’s seat, came third – a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital Morelia, denied ties to drug dealers and urged other candidates to acknowledge the results.
In Michoacan, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines had long been dominant.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence continues to this day.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the election when he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and several candidates left the local election race out of fear.
For the IRP, however, no matter how horrible the elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n look, victory will give the party a driving impetus.
The man who should represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very inspiring in the run-up to next year."
ADB Persuades Asia to Help Save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has obligated India and China to be willing to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term downturn that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB office in Manila, said the two fastest-growing major economies should “do everything they can” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRICS countries looked at Europe’s difficulties “unbiasedly” and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
“It concerns all of us.”
“Therefore, anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable.”
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing funds have risen threateningly, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The unfolding debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could once again drive the world economy into recession, and has led to calls from leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any Asian assistance would be delivered through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial assistance fund bonds, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provides enormous strength in the negotiations with Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decrease in foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and uneasy,” he said.
“We have grandiose goals and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a possible option, it’s a prerequisite, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our boys and girls.”
Others argue that it makes no sense for emerging economies like India to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshni, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to provide assistance to Europe for India’s 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point, they will learn that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and going on holidays to the sea, and that will not be taken well," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, loss-making enterprises such as the railways.
Mr. Neg said the eurozone crisis threatens “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
The ADB’s forecast of 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 now faces “lower risk” due to a threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to come up with “emergency plans” to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon’s alarming warnings about potential reductions in defense spending
Defense Minister Leon Panetta instigated the situation on Monday in Congress, warning that expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to a $450 billion cut in the coming decade, but now fears that additional cuts of $600 billion or more could be unavoidable if Congress fails to agree on spending.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating to the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Republican Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to adopt a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequester will initiate a general reduction of 23% and the cessation of many new projects.
"Such a sharp reduction, applied so recklessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unfeasible -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building -- and will seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote.
“We will also have to lay off many of our staff, and since the cut will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to lay off staff to achieve our goals.”
“These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and cause serious damage to our readiness.”
The reductions will ultimately affect military units, Panetta said.
"Although military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious breakdown in major budgets," Panetta warned.
“The contract staff will be reduced, which will end in the cancellation of the contracts and the supervision contract that the troops support.”
“State personnel will be reduced, which will lead to delays with payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defense.
“The consequence of sequestration in the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as a leading world military power.”
“We stand steadfastly against these draconian actions,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday evening as they released Panetta’s letter.
“It’s not the way we can live, and it’s not the way we have to force ourselves.”
"Sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen."
Whether the Panetta letter or recent senatorial warnings will lead to a budget compromise or intensify calls for the Pentagon’s release from cuts, we’ll see later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about possible cuts, although he came to work in the Pentagon leadership after years of conducting budget reviews in Congress and the White House and realizing that he was facing a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister drew a dull picture of what could come next -- troops with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"This is a squad without bullets."
"It's a wing of an aircraft without enough trained pilots."
“This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” Panetta said in his introductory remarks to the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, poor readiness and incapable of fighting potential enemies.”
“In fact, it encourages aggression.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta voiced new details of how the reductions "generate significant operational risks: slowing down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limiting our ability to be the first to deploy and respond anywhere in the world."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects may face hurdles, including those that have already passed tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 strike fighter, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone battleship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marine Corps need to replace the hammer.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its proponents say it is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to Catch a Lie
A quick look at the latest headlines shows just how serious and pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential nominee Herman Kane is busy challenging allegations of sexual harassment by several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania has been charged with false testimony as they allegedly concealed that the retired football coach had raped the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar while the microphone was on.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner has made a fool of himself by denying his credentials, which was quickly denied by incontestable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with financial fraud during a campaign to cover up extramarital affairs.
And again, none of those living at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was convicted of lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of cheating on exams in school and college are commonplace.
There were cases when teachers gave students the answers to the tests to have a good evaluation of the results of their own activities.
Mentors who have to teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
Within a day, research shows, you can be lied to 10 to 200 times.
Now it is assumed that a significant part of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of dating each other.
Detection of a lie or reproof of a lie is a necessary skill for everyone, both for personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game, similar to, say, a charade, where you need to shout “Get it!”, the detection of lies is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been debunked.
The liars look into the eyes.
They don’t always get stuck, stuttered, reddish or vanish.
It is not necessary to conclude from this that liars are difficult to notice and difficult to expose.
An experienced lie-discoverer can get to the truth by observing the structure of statements, mimics, structure of questions, and temporal characteristics.
I have spent several years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of the knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the detection of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps to navigate in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, and more.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel relaxed, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more about others, usually to protect someone’s feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried ones (but the lie they tell is most often blunt).
We also know that if you are perceived as a cheat, others will feel less guilty about cheating on you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called “determination of the initial state.”
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing the changes further.
Observe the posture, laughter, voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person is constantly tapping his feet in a normal state, then you will not make unfair accusations when you see a tapping of his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
Cheaters can fix the upper part of their body when they try to remember their story, they can put their feet towards the door, lean towards the exit, change their posture in a certain way, or show “relief after the interview” — this exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture when all is difficult.
Investigators often falsify the end-of-interview signal to simply look at this relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to the speech of your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson stepped back and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her searches across the country.
Vaping people can also use distancing in speeches: “I haven’t had a sexual relationship with this woman...Miss Lewinsky” or repeat a complex question altogether.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely catchable.
Someone may use “qualifying language” when answering a difficult question: “Well...in truth...as far as I know...as far as I know.”
This makes the response more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to detect a lie, but it is possible to master the skill of detecting deception.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not becoming a victim of skilled scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan for the construction of the oil pipeline needs to be revised after the U.S. threat to postpone its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- prompting unions' anger but reassuring environmentalists -- the company that is going to build the pipeline is reassuring that it is reluctant to re-open the pipeline.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it will remove the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Sand Hills area in Nebraska and is confident that the project will still receive approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the state of Nebraska.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the State Department said last week that it would postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills area and the Ohalala aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
“This is a real step forward,” said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department is likely to delay the decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although authorities have denied that the decision was politically involved.
In a written statement last week, Obama called the decision a call from the State Department, and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It is expected to transport 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to oil refineries in Texas.
To do this, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by trade unions, which hope for about 20,000 jobs related to the oil pipeline.
But lawmakers in Nebraska, opposed to the plan, are considering a bill to speed up movement from the Sand Hills area and the Ohallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study by the State Department on environmental impacts showed that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source in the energy industry said that the Department's auditor had ordered a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other was whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate as it was related to TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle was sued for allegedly causing her child to feel sick from fear.
The New York family claims that disco diva Patty LaBelle began roaring in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scaring their teenage daughter to the point that she shook with fear.
"Lady Marmalade's tyranny scared 18-month-old Geneva Monk so much that she endured 'personality change, sleep disorder' and 'strong fear of strangers,'" her family said in a statement.
It happened on November 10 last year, when the working scene of Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk descended into the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle made an apology to a pregnant woman.
“She said aggressively, ‘You shouldn’t have left your daughter at the door,’” Rosanna Monk said.
“I told her, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’”
She became furious and began to use insults -- the word in C and the word in F -- in raised tones ...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had a hysteria.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” the mother said.
LaBelle rushed to her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her companions had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The baby was crying so hard that she was snorting, she added.
The family later sent LaBelle an apology note, but received no response.
Lawyers and LaBelle representatives do not answer calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took up the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it receives to charity for children with cancer.
“The goal is to make Patty LaBelle accountable for her actions,” Davis said.
“Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially with regard to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms.”
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez’s rule in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labor market increased, foreign financing decreased and the economy weakened.
2011 is the year that will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as related to the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, also called the year of change, which generated great hopes for the development of the economy, but given the unfavorable climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but there was a decline in the main development.
The low temperatures of February not only led to losses of millions for the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth opportunities of the state economy, causing a decrease in economic activity overall by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical economic fall of 31.16 percent in the agricultural sector.
According to a report from the Mexico Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were affected in full and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected. The main damaged crops were vegetables, corn and
The rate of economic activity has increased by more than 18000, the rate of unemployment in the state has increased by 6.19, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, for the first three quarters there has been an accelerated increase in unemployment, from January to March, the rate of unemployment of the population of Sinaloa was by 55.053.
Reduced liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is discussed by many factors, for economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions that have been taken in public policy.
“What we’re seeing now is an increase in unemployment that is associated with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market in order to limit the resources imposed by the law that was passed in Congress to fight money laundering, as people who illegally own dollars are told it’s not easy to work with them,” he said.
Stopped Immigration (disambiguation)
Lopez Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the growth of unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad in the U.S. has been limited, primarily because of difficulties with entry, and secondly - since once they enter, they are already faced with a lot of difficulties in finding work, so a group of people stay and require jobs here in the state," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The labor market analysis of Sinaloa is getting worse if you pay attention to the large number of violations that predominate in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the active population of the state works without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and formal violations, another reminder of working in the state is low wages; the state has the lowest wages in the country, according to records from the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Department of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos until September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July, the state FDI was 630,697 dollars during the period, which shows a fall of 87.74 percent compared with 5.14
For its part, the state government’s Ministry of Economic Development recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which mainly fell on services companies.
Debt (disambiguation)
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the state government asked in July during the state congress for approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, at the local level, only 2,600 million pesos were approved by the shugu sector, and until November, no more.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez demonstrates a lack of government capabilities.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of Processing Industries, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, there is a lot of work to do to restore the positions lost this year, in 2012 we must double our efforts, we have not been able to agree on the efforts of everyone and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we said - it will be much better next year," he said.
Slowing the economy
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Loredo said events such as the early freezes this year halted the state’s economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“Low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not becoming fast enough to create economic dynamics that allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we are closing it below our expectations,” he said.
Revision of direction
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said the state needs to continue its most dynamic production activity.
“Overall, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Upcoming work
President Coparmex emphasized the importance of defining the future direction in order to better direct the efforts of the government.
“Overall, I would say that the government is trying to be successful in various areas, in terms of economic development there is little progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program,” he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own way of public policy.
“There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that there is much more that needs to be done,” he said.
He was sentenced to eight kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine in the amount of income for 100 days - such a sentence was handed down to citizen Navolato for the storage of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office said that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valensuela Sandoval, convicted of an anti-health crime, in this case, the storage of marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valencia Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on June 7, 2010, while patrolling the street of Cypriano Valdes, in front of post No. 80 in the city of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was behind the wheel of a white pickup truck, in which he carried a black bag in a box in the car, and a small backpack on the passenger seat, where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was transferred to the Second District Court, and the accused continues to be a prisoner in the Crime Legal Impact Support Center.
You need to make contributions to work.
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Saving Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk remaining unfinished or delayed due to lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that although the work programmes have been developed so far, they are in jeopardy as the state government is unable to make the corresponding contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State should contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided the resources to work, so it is still possible to delay their completion.
“They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us a penny when they were supposed to give us a share since the beginning of July,” he said, “so as not to delay, we’ve started work and they’ve made a lot of progress, but we need the money.”
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions that he had to make, so at the beginning of the term of office the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the state administration.
“It happened to us in the previous administration because the state had no financial opportunity to participate and programs continued to evolve, and this year to access those programs, we need to find the resources to cover what the state owes,” he explained.
Although the state authorities have an obligation to deliver these resources, he says that the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to increase efforts so that the interest on them comes as soon as possible.
“They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us a penny.”
Court approves ‘transition to digital television’ in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court rejected constitutional claims filed by the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which postpones the so-called “transition to digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes were not collected necessary for its annulment.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n had not exceeded his powers by issuing a decree detailing actions for the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims asserted by the Senate were rejected due to the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television program is a right enshrined in the law of the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, and Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting it was also decided to reject the demand of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the prime minister said he disagreed with the project's arguments in the sense that the federal executive cannot determine by common rules the measures to be prepared by the state administration.
“I also do not believe that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” and recalled that planning public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive authority, which has a constitutional mandate, state governance.
Replacing analog signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years, leading to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Delaying the transition, he said, would mean deferring the benefits of transforming into a digital form that includes meeting societal needs that have not only a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These issues, he said, "require the work of the whole system, formed on the principle of state economic management, includes a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into state executive power."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and have done so with the help of the executive, despite the availability of highly specialized technical institutions.
From this it cannot be concluded that the Government, in adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competences of Congress, ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data transmitted in the PRTR, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes, accounting for 879 out of the total number of 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of counting "vote-by-vote" is real, as far as this year's election process in Michoacan is concerned, where, according to data obtained from the Preliminary Election Results Program (PRPP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor's elections is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes of 8.
In light of this, the Chairman of the General Council of the Michoacan Electoral Institute (IMI), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral corps approved a package of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As it should be recalled, Michoacan did not pass the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law Act, as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal date of their entry into force in this electoral process and the governor of the province, Leonel Year Rangel, has stated that the law did not include its publication in the deadline, o
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJJ) ruled on a constitutional claim filed by the local legislature and called the vote of the state representative on constitutional reform “invalid and illegal” because he has no right to “allow or support them.”
In an interview on the possibility of “vote by vote”, Maria de los Angeles Lianderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council of the IWM, it would be possible to present a partial or full count of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, a partial recount of one or more ballot boxes may be made on the condition that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no voting and document counting protocol in the ballot box or it is not with the Chair; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, a total recount of the votes at all polling stations may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged candidate-winner of the elections in question and those who received the second place in the vote is less than or equal to one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from a candidate from a representative of the party and/or coalition, which you
A general recount of votes will also be made if at the end of the usual count it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than or equal to one percent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate took the second place, in the event that part of the ballot box, which has been drawn.
It is worth noting that in this situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the EPP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even without counting 129 votes out of the total number of 923 in the protocol.
His Last Will
Its dust will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortes arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday evening; on Monday, an inquest and a serene mass were held.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last will was to have his ashes scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama.
After accepting condolences along with other people who died in the crash, the family of Basio Cortes returned to the capital of Coauila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people to the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel’s dust arrived in the chapel located on Nazario Ortis Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he underwent an examination at the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during his high school education.
“His desire was to return to Saltillo, and for his dust to be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama, he always told his family and friends,” said Sandra Cortez Basio, the pilot’s sister.
In her opinion, the colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, son and loving brother, devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortes Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the College of Aviation in Sapporo, Calisco.
Some didn’t believe him, they said that he had a spinning head even in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo".
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapporo for a ceremony of handing over the diplomas of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in his life: driving a plane.
They lead him on the last path.
Shots from the guns were fired in honor of the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force 1985, Felipe Cortez Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, people from the village and the state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, Tequila, and the Mexican Air Force.
Basio Cortez was killed recently when the helicopter he was driving crashed, along with the Secretary of the Provincial Government, Jose Francisco Blake Moray, and six others, all representatives of this ministry.
At 18:05 the remains of Basio Cortez (creamy), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral bureau members of the Mexican Air Force headed by Major James Martinez, on the esplanade of the training school where his brother and his mother, his daughter Aman, were already waiting for him.
Three bodies found dumped on Kaderata's farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a control shot on an abandoned farm in the municipality of Caderaita Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was found on the 1.5-kilometre Caderaite Highway towards Santiago, on an elevation in a commune known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed by noticed that in a village house, the wall of which is painted in beige and brown, the gate was open.
Looking inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately let the relevant authorities know.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow T-shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
Nearly one meter was the body of another person, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere, as there were no shells at the site.
On the fence of the village house there are signs addressed to one organized criminal group another, also in it and in the gate there are several holes from bullets.
11 captured in Kaderet
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadreita, and who are accused of kidnappings, murders, "fraud" and secret burials.
According to published information, eight people were initially detained in the Los Alveros colony on November 11, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another event happened on November 12 at 06:00 in the morning, military personnel made a patrol drive in the village of Old Rancho in Caderaite, when he saw a car without license plates with two men in the cabin.
Stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 cartridges.
Later, after these statements, on November 13, at 14:00, one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Pravda, who, after seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Terran, Hina and Cadreita.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present a new government that will face the crisis that has put the country on the verge of economic disaster.
Italy’s appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and hurt the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive body will take its position.
Monti said he would present the results of his negotiations with political parties to the president in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
“The structure is well-designed now,” he said.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that brought the size of their debt to a critical level.
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
Based on pressure on Monti to hurry, volatile markets set Italy’s 10-year BTP bond yields at more than 7 percent, a level that Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this government is Italy’s last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monti’s chances of success were largely based on the support of LDP’s Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts should lead to a good outcome,” Angelino Alfano, the secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
Support for the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the governmental majority, consisting of technocrats, which forms Monti.
Parliamentary backing
The new Monti government should have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and destructive attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has stepped up pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
On Monday, Monty began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations.
He will finish his meeting on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italy’s debt cost has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy with a government debt of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 billion would be too much for modern euro zone financial defenders.
Monty said his government would exist until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread projections that politicians would only give him time to reform before appointing a new election.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist that it should only be made up of technical experts, a testimony to their dissatisfaction with the fact that the process is affected by the financial situation.
Political sources said the mutual distrust and disagreement of the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The Spaniards have more gaming experience than Ticos
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
From the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 matches.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, compared to the 22 players brought by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, have a whole list of qualifying games of class A, Tricolor has only defender Michael Umana as the only one who has held 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the stadium named after Rommel Fernandez.
Spanish footballers playing in the All-Star League and the strong clubs of the Premier League of England were very active in the league and in local cup competitions during this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and Champions League.
To this it is worth adding the experience of the Spanish Fury in a difficult qualification in the Euro or World Cup.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in an area like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the leader of the list in the Spanish national team goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of ex-goalkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, a Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Javi were recognized as the best last week by UEFA along with another player of the Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and Shalke bomber Raul Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez with 102.
Almost approaching a hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Sesc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rican side next to Michael Umana, left-sided Junior Diaz with 48 games and bomber Brian Ruiz - with 45.
Then, only five crossed the line in 30 games: Caillor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
Remainder.
More than 30 matches in Spain were played by Gerardo Picquet (37), Sergio Buskets (36), Santiago Sant<0xC3><0xAD> Casorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiola (31).
In the national team with less than 30 starts on the field there is Roy Miller with 26 games, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murry with 23.
The others didn’t even make it to 20.
While Nacho Morales has only four games, and Horda Alba has two, in Costa Rica, Victor Bolivar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet made their debut.
Spain's leading player David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who scored twice as many points as Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three times as many as Roy Murray and Parks.
The quintet included the country in the tour in honor of the twentieth anniversary of his career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band says it’s also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
This was the claim of bassist and founder Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is on the territory of South America as part of a tour in honor of the twentieth anniversary of the work and on Sunday, the 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Los Angeles X team and the local Las Robertas group.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full decryption of which is available online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans it’s a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once - on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
We are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask about it because there is some loyalty to the band; the fans live in tension in the days before the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, in anticipation of your concert, regard it as the biggest show of the year.
Does it add a little tension to your visit?
“Some of the biggest shows we’ve played in the past 21 years have taken place over the last two weeks.
We have had some great shows in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo and we hope this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you learn about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfing friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, these are great places for surfing, this is how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, we can say that you have done a great show with a lot of songs.
What do you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with a wide variety of songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a great variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven’t played for a while, it keeps us in tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
This tour marks 20 years of your career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us could ever have imagined that we would be in a rock band and the fact that we’ve been doing this for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We are very happy with our success and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We are happy to travel to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
Everything is going very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the blossoming of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We are good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and it’s unusual.
From time to time, one group appears from the same city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle band.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with all of them and for us the honor to be part of the Seattle sound that turned out.
It is also very strange that a band like yours stays together and in the same composition for so long.
Yes, the four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, musical paths have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other’s music and everything could not have been better.
Your attitude to the word fame was not easy; but thanks to your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We take care not to be on tour too long, because it’s easy to get into this game with large crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what it has done without deciding to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we write really good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and didn’t release a single album until the death of Andy (Andy Woods).
There was a lot of disappointment because it lasted so long, and the most important thing is that we are still close friends with Bruce (Fervazer) and Greg (Gilmore), who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photo of me, I think of the incredible person who was behind Andy, and I think of the amazing person who is behind me.
He was a wonderful man and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you’re familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose her to open up?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video offers, and it was the band we liked the most, so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live, and it should be very exciting.
Why do you constantly change the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question to Ed (Eddie Vedder) so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
So many of them.
Among the first to come to mind are Heather Butler, John Entwissle, C.J. Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the grunge, despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of him, he reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone that came along at the same time, and if that’s important now, I think it’s great because it’s the music that’s worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are making music better now than ever.
At first your music was darker, and now it has become more positive.
How would you explain this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a few songs on the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very gloomy, although they may sound a bit positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very gloomy.
I think when you grow up and you’ve had some kind of trauma in your life and you’ve lost a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that to me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fuchimori was hospitalized at a state hospital on Tuesday for an examination for the loss of muscle strength seen in the legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his tenure (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told N television that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that, in his opinion, Fujimori should be a candidate for pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said he did not want it because he knows he was innocent.
He underwent four surgeries for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms of weight, plus other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with blood circulation in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Police Office of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the army's destruction squad, which operated secretly in the early years of his reign.
Muhika travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will arrive on Tuesday to visit Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on the region’s political issues.
Muhika will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the most important point of an extensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "favorable for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations," the South American leadership said on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking Calderon’s support for Uruguay in the incident with France, which happened when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that prompted protests from Uruguay and a withdrawal for the consultations of his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group made up of the most developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, a tax information exchange agreement with the South American country since January this year to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements in order to leave the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s “grey list” of countries that do not use international standards for tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which increased trade between the two countries.
The sluggish plumber will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser’s evil paws, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in “Super Mario 3D Land,” he will fight for a girl’s love in stereoscopic technology.
The release, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell how stereoscopy will work without glasses," said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvares, head of the Nintendo press service in Spain, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specifically designed for this platform" because hitherto successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations of existing games.
Nintendo said that, despite its existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go "by the second round" to the levels of the game, which this time are more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that affects only the depth of action, but that needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome a variety of obstacles and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional Super Mario invasion also marks the hero's return to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo blinks fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, a plumber with a mustache needs to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new moves, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the "player" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the process of Alfonso Portillo’s extradition had begun for him to answer in the United States for a $70 million laundering plot.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to a request by a northern country that demanded the extradition of Portillo to be tried there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was linked to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he did not “handle” legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures he had ever known about.
Along with Portillo, Sergio Rouano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for selling drugs.
What Kolom has done shows the enforcement process after all legitimate and constitutional courts have been exhausted in order to prosecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of wasting $120 million in the Department of Defense during his presidency, a process that preceded his extradition, but the Department of Public Affairs filed an appeal and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 at-risk young people
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove’s social support organization are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social isolation have helped overcome difficult situations during this quarter of a century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the results of the ceremony held in the premises of the old factory Fabra I Coats, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove was born next to the Trinity Villa in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with a lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or vulnerable to marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association in these 25 years.
The different political views during the elections showed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Mass, and his predecessor, Hordy Puchol, attended the ceremony by former consultant to the Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and former Lieutenant Mayor and current eco-socialist, a member of the municipal council, Richard Goma.
Fabra I Coats also featured current Social Welfare and Family Consultant Josep Lewis Claris and La Caixa Social Work CEO Haume Lanaspa.
He said Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The Chairperson cited Trinijove as an example of combating bad circumstances and instilling hope in people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not new to the organization and the work done to it,” he said.
The captured building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated
Invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupants left the building yesterday at noon without a fight
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living in the house 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they had illegally occupied at noon yesterday, where they had mass parties that irritated neighbors, by a court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
“From now on, there will be bandwidth control here,” the manager said.
The squatters, who captured 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest inhabited, appropriated all the electricity and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially the cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a platform for mass parties that lasted up to two days and annoyed the owners.
Right behind the building is the nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the building dragged her into an unfair competition, as they were selling drinks for three euros, while in the club for 10.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to complaints of neighbors about noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by the visitors of the club, but by residents of the squat and, above all, by those who attended parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which has increased, as they said, with the separation.
The owner of the club said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now, he has been "forgiving" her the payment of the rent.
The city police also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, councillor Alberto Fernand Diaz, called last week for "immediate evacuation of the building to address the problems of coexistence and the common spirit that have emerged from neighbors and degradation in this area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months squatters have invaded all floors and virtually every room and that some of them were hacked.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to resist with perseverance the culturelessness that is taking place in the building."
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building in No Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police drove off to Montral Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four of them were arrested immediately.
A park or a mountain?
The architects agree with the possibility of a competition after the controversies about the contributions
The municipal competition for 16 doors resumed the debate about the role of Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now extinct Barcelona Capital Corporation (SCB), this administration printed promotional leaflets for Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in the capital city of Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of SCB, in 1987 the park again took a place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that is oriented not north-south, but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The positioning of Colserola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as the Yogi Bear.
This was the case until, in September, the council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 competitions for many other goals in Colserol.
Under the gate is the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that, or someone wants to put a gate in the field.
The question is one: Colserola? Park or mountain?
Competitions, and their organizational side, and their influence on the city, are a topic for discussion by all architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most repetitive topic discussed when two members of this clan of elected people get to know each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads to just one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present say.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes “necessary” to discuss the “front side of the mountain” when Ildefon Cerda’s proposal, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
“We have to admit that the biggest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent accessibility.
Colserola is more complex,” says the architect, for whom the title “Colserola Gate” contains a “word trap”: we should not think of them “as entering the park, but as limiting some areas where we have to act.”
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayon with experience in urban construction, called the proposal an "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
Risks arising due to the "uncertainty of predicting public space" after the experience of the 80s, which ended on the Forum's platform with "his swan song".
The first fear is actually limiting the boundaries where you can build.
“The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step,” I mean the transition.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools because the current [as far as the General Capital Plan (GSP) is concerned] can lead to real trouble.”
Closer to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, and not" as a purely topographical issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside of Calcerola, which "is not to be missed", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers to his profession, to join this project "from the beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter into debates, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should be led by interdisciplinary teams ("success", he claims), which should have created: "Only architects should be".
Bayonne hints that the answer to the question that asks the name of this part is complex, since the rules of the contest lack a general view of Colserola: "It was announced 16 intersecting competitions, - he says - in the sense of sea-mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading here to see and understand the area."
This forces, at least in his case, to decide to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one gate can intersect according to the program and definition with the project of the architect for the neighboring gate.
From your point of view, the advice is to ensure that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, a Red Casino representative pardoned the mayor's brother Monterrey in a lawsuit against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legal representative of Red Casino granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting an extortion trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garcia published a series of photos and videos where allegedly Manuel Jonas demanded he pay an economic contribution to the Monterrey authorities to allow a secret operation in the gambling den.
After a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He remained in that place for 49 days, following the requirements of the second order on the prohibition of movement after the prosecutor ruled out crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyt for allegedly extorting half a million pesos from the owner of the Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours there in prison with an average degree of solitary confinement because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his stay at the municipal prison in San Nicolas in Garza.
On October 25, the arrest warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Janez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, evidence of Jonas’s guilt, such as charging 1.5 million pesos from bookmakers in exchange for the transaction’s permission, was quite obvious.
On Monday, Red Casino’s legal representative, Victor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Gomez, appeared before Judge Jose Luis Pesina to ask for pardons for the region’s mayor’s brother, so he could be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the state prosecutor at the court, asked Garcia Gomez if he had compensated the damage and which of the partners of the gambling house is granting a pardon, although the lawyer tried not to give the name.
Based on record 197/2011, a lawful pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabala, and after that no statements could be made about the trial that had been planned against him; nor would any reparation or punishment be required.
After the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 15:50, it was ordered to immediately release Larrasabal Breton.
A court official, Jorge Janés, went to the San Nicolas municipality prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He shall also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionisio Peres Hacome talks about the details of the disaster that killed the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results obtained by an accident in which Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died, showed that the helicopter hit the ground in a state of complete integrity, without any attempts.
During the press conference, Dionisio Peres Hacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft climbed up, the pilot found out that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements that appear to show that the ship had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters, where the vehicle lost flux."
He also reported that the ship was intended for 19 people, respectively, it met the necessary requirements for the transport of people.
He also said that studies carried out in the area of the impact do not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"The study reports that elsewhere there are no components of the ship, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
“The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the corresponding requirements of transporting passengers.
The ground in this place has a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
By this point, the secretary said, the main thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even one year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, CEO of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said the president’s helicopter was operating at cruising speed during the strike and that it was on soft rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of the usual flight maneuver at the time of the impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of SCT, Peres Hakome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the rules of aviation, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the team must have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports identified suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft headed for the border area between the city of Mexico and the state of Mexico, where low-altitude cloud layers were observed.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to cloud conditions, the team was looking for a zone of lower altitude and greater visibility in the Kuernavaka valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record from the radar of the aircraft coincide, probably, before the impact there was no loss of control or change of direction of flight.
Scattering of debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the strike occurred on the front and side lines.
The scattered debris suggests that the helicopter collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No obvious signs of a fire or explosion were found:
In the area of the disaster remains unfounded evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies suggest that there may have been multiple contact with the earth.
While working on the site were found pieces of aircraft at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough investigation in a larger area than the designated area near the site of the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the strike occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Obesity Gene Search Program
Social protection leads a study to find the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by specialists from IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, which has been dubbed the “Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence” protocol, which will provide a count of signs associated with overweight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz Lopez, head of the Department of Medical Research in Biochemistry at the National Medical Center of the 21st Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been assembled.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students of the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (whether prescribed or not) is invited to participate by going to the MSSI sports centers participating in the study, in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday, from 8:00 am, tests with children will be conducted.
He emphasized that the protocol began to be conducted at the sports center in Queuetoque (western state of Mexico), and from October 8 the events are held at the sports center in Nessaualcoyotl (eastern state of Mexico).
Once the target of attracting 500 to 600 children has been reached, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (Southern Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (Northern Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study is to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day will be celebrated, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 years with the permission of their parents and under their supervision to fill out individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to the onset of diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist circumference), measurement of blood pressure and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity) will be carried out.
Cruz Lopez said the study reflects health care professionals’ concern about worrying weight gain among children.
In medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006, there was an increase in just 6 years: in the case of boys, 77 per cent suffered from obesity, in the case of girls, 47 per cent; as for excess weight, there was also a significant increase, "said the MSSI expert.
He said that the rationale for searching for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican is 65 percent descended from American Indians, 30 percent from Europeans, and five percent from Africans, and this condition has affected the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, basically, the consequence of obesity genetics is the body’s inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and it is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that a direct benefit to participants is a comprehensive assessment of children, which can identify whether they have any degree of excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark wrinkles on the neck (acants) and forearms means the likelihood of a metabolic disorder and even prediabetes.
The information is treated with complete confidentiality, the doctors pass it on in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the dimensions and lifestyle changes that must be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main causes of overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the TV, and using transportation at short distances instead.
This is also due to the high calorie intake, that is, the increase in the consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tamala, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic predisposition analyzed in this program.
Asphalt UNAM can avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, has developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a blend of the best quality, resistant to environmental and temperature exposure.
If the signals sent by the road surface were paid attention, then it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM chemical faculty, and adds that if the process of construction and construction
In his lecture, The Technological Look at Wells, read within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and, therefore, to counteract the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of which are high molecular weight, called asphalts, and others of which are low molecular weight, called malts, which together give the road surface its characteristic viscosity.
The viscous behavior of bitumen is the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, bitumen becomes clumpy.
This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not constant, but changes during the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, said the specialist in chemical engineering.
A chimfaq scientist noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible coating, which consists of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the topmost layers is bitumen, made up of small stones, dropped into bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is submerged in bitumen.
When moving vehicles and exerting effort, it helps the forces to be very well distributed along the road surface.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt coating, he added, the last layer, which is called the wear layer, is made of fine stone, in fact the sand is also submerged in the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will come into contact with the wheels of the transport, it should have more resistance than the asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute these efforts, the wear layer also requires an appropriate thickness and it is necessary to take into account the material from which it is made.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the state of the asphalt.
When the soil is raw, the water penetrates the coating and it is difficult for it to get out of there, it causes the softening of all layers of the coating and, therefore, the formation of pits.
When forming pits, he said, the first layer of wear wears out and only then it affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur immediately, it is a process that should be paid attention to at the first signs under the programs of current repair.
Also, a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of coating should always be associated with the transport load and it is necessary to ensure that this requirement is met to prevent the frequent appearance of holes.
Rafael Herrera said that with regard to bitumen, much still needs to be studied and done, for example, bitumen emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and even help to repair pits with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serna Melina Ramirez from obtaining the crown of Miss Colombia.
A representative of Vallee won the title of princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was left only to wish to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with getting on the podium with a silver crown and ribbon proclaiming her the new Princess of Colombia.
With regard to the result achieved by Alejandro Alejandro (Alejandro Alejandro) (198), Alejandro Alejandro (Alejandro Alejandro), Alejandro Alejandro (Alejandro Alejandro Alejandro), Alejandro Alejandro Alejandro (Alejandro Alejandro Alejandro), Alejandro Alejandro (Alejandro Alejandro), Alejandro Alejandro (Alejandro Alejandro), Alejandro (Alejandro Alejandro Alejandro) (19Alejandro Alejandro Alejandro) (19Alejandro Alejandro Alejandro), Alejandro) (19Alejandro Alejandro Alejandro Alejandro Alej
The question that many are asking now:
What was not enough? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the performances demonstrated that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not just so she was chosen by the Queen Police and the most beautiful face according to the version of the Vogue. The titles of the Varvara, Mila, are the titles that were possessed by Koroleva
The first factor that played a role in the jury’s decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to convincingly answer the question “Which book characterizes you and why?” asked by Martin Murilla Gomez of the literary society Let’s Read.
She replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a form of culture, and I definitely think the book that characterizes my childhood – The Little Prince – is a pretty deep book.
Today I read Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; also at the moment I am reading the book of Irina Nemirovska, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Heat of Blood.
The answer, which the jury did not like because of the term "cultivation" and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the cited books characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and satisfied with her result: "the universe is wise, what is going to happen".
And all of you, please read at least a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the voiced hypotheses – Valle burned from favoritism.
A reporter from Bogota suggested that, as she was preferred, she was met with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (the culinary competition of Ostera, the spectator's vote for the best national costume, and the Queen-Mother's sculptor), "which aroused the jealousy of other candidates.
And this was noted during her first swimsuit appearance at Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy demonstrated by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on RCN’s How to Live, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess “means that the candidate who wins more awards during the contest does not become a queen.”
In addition, the representative of Valle has recently avoided contact with the press and this was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle has failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the election, Lucy Dotti, an international jury member, said she was looking for a woman who was committed to her country’s social needs.
“One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we need to look not only at the appearance, but also focus on the public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they already have to be involved in the projects,” she said.
There is also a suggestion that the representative of Valle was wrong about the defects on her buttocks and the fibrosis that was seen on her stomach, but this is controversial, as the jury especially noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens consultant Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orosco notes that Melina did not have the best body, which was even better, "but the problems of abdominal fibrosis, which were not very noticeable to me, made her lose glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Oyos from the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she had undergone surgery.
"Operations are good, but the representative of Valé doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was first presented by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, the cruel prediction came true last night, saying that it was a duel that Raimundo gave Melina as compensation for losing her pleasure in getting the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that today Melina begins a year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions indicated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the competition in Cartagena, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of the man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A forensic scientist from Cali has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI forensic scientist Kali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of FARC chief Alfonso Cano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working at the CTI, this week it was time to “guard” Elizaro Gonzalez, a Puerto Rican man who spent 21 years in the field of criminal investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzales worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to travel more than five days through the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valais and after completing the corresponding courses, he became a specialist in forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. palms and stumps.
During the week of Elizar’s operation to identify a person known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was approaching.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Caucasus to Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten photographs of the prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research group at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it by its appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and significantly thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, a shovel and a flashlight, Elizar compared the body's fingerprints to those in the pictures.
His eyes were not deceived: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defense Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the RVSC.
Searching for Fingerprints
The recognition received by President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar Gonzalez at a press conference on the operation against Canoe is particularly significant for a specialist in the field of fingerprinting of the Sijin branch of Cali.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a rigorous science, without errors, it can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to the identification of bodies, fingerprinting specialists take part in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and establish the identity of the detainees.
When detained, many criminals have false IDs or no documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in case of theft he had to carry a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief leaned his hands to master a safe full of jewels and money.
“It’s hard to work with walls because they’re not convenient surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a full-sized shot and identify the criminal who was involved in several thefts,” he said.
The prints also help rule out or establish the involvement of suspects in murder-related cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with bottles of liquor around him.
In the course of the investigation, it was established that a relative may have been suspected of committing the crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A CTI fingerprinting specialist explained that a chemical or physical reagent is applied to places where there are fingerprints.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the database of criminals, or are entered in the registry.
“The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the TV program about CSI.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not all that you touch leaves footprints.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
‘Angry People’ Challenge New York Authorities
Hundreds of protesters camped in front of Zukkotti Square.
Some of the protesters heard a court decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park next door.
Members of the Wall Street Movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square under the protection of a court order, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to seize another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters rallied at Zukotti Square, where they wanted to get to thanks to a court order that allowed “angry people” to smash a camp in the square, while the other part of the movement responded to the rallies by seizing a park in the north of the city where further arrests were carried out.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to smash the camp in the square, we’ll smash the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zucotti and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations,” said one of the representatives of the Wall Street Campaign.
Bray explained that the response of “angry people” to the evacuation of the tent town, which was personally ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a ruling banning forced evacuation from the square and allowing the evacuation.
In addition, the "angry people" began to seize a new park, located on the site of the merging of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned the arrival of the Church of the Trinity.
At least an hour they could take the place, but then the police arrived and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not give the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The organization claims that several hundred people were tented in the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to show support to members of the movement, trying to act as a mediator in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zukotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, which will consider the legality of this morning’s crackdown on protesters.
Some of the protesters headed there carried and distributed copies of that court order at the same time and even gave those copies to police guards, leading to “some small clashes,” said Bray, who said some policemen beat protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of the Wall Street Movement and forcing them to “enforce laws that were issued after the start of the capture, or prohibiting demonstrators from re-entering the park with stores and other property previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court’s ruling, the city suspended the opening of public space and protesters were informed about it, but local laws do not allow them to reopen tent shops and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of the protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made, and a decision was made because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg said he had ordered the area to be cleared as it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people," as "some businesses received threats" and neighbors feared "the quality of life would deteriorate."
The evacuation this morning was disgusting and shows Bloomberg’s deepest interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” said a spokesman for the movement, which denounces the mayor for “disrespecting freedom of speech.”
Wall Street activists also said they planned to stage “grand events” on Thursday in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions to commemorate the last two months of protests that began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bubble and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on Russell Peters’ Christmas TV show on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Big Repair", rescuer in "Saviors of Malibu", Bannie in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the crown prince (a ballad performer) Michael Bubble and other prominent Canadians, will appear in the television program "Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1, as a very special Maria.
CTV today unveiled footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for a widespread home-made pornographic video on the Internet, where she appears alongside her then-husband, Tommy Lee’s “Mötley Crüe” drummer, dressed up as the Virgin Mary, holding a stool.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently performed as the host of Charlie Sheen’s My Cruel Torpedo of Truth tour, appears in the role of Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a special CTV Christmas show is attended by Canadian singer Buble, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires to Argentine model Luisiano Lopilato and who also knows the meaning of scandals.
Buble recently called American Kim Kardashian a “slut” during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Resurrected After the Earthquake
GDP grew 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and put an end to the downturn that began in March
Since March last year, Japan’s economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has resulted in a nuclear crisis, the most terrible disaster suffered by the Land of the Rising Sun since World War II.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo government, the material losses amounted to $ 300,000 million - a blow that, despite the dire global situation, seems to be underway.
After three lossy quarters in a row, gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% year-on-year.
Recorded in the second quarter, for the Japanese, the financial year begins in March 2012 and also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The revival may be partly due to the revival of the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% versus a 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real break in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for the use of the crisis to strengthen — or restructure — the infrastructure, using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up, mainly due to the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This figure increased by 1% due to an increase in the cost of cars, travel and recreation.
Yen's stamp
Tokyo gave the domestic market when the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “refugee currencies” chosen by investors who want to get rid of the euro zone debt crisis and negative U.S. forecasts, a privilege that is squeezing like a stone into the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic rate is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for its low performance from July to September.
As markets continue to squander the EU’s periphery, the Esihiko Noda government is not reducing vigilance.
We need to be vigilant about continuing risks such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flooding in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, Economic Policy Minister Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts disruptions in the global economy, has shown that the underlying forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone even fell below the average, which is at 100 points, after it fell eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens once again gives grounds for doubt.
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign any written commitment.
With periphery rewards for risk and uncertainty reigning in the parks, Greece continues to wander the labyrinth that leads to a way out of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consent” of Greece’s new transitional government has been imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred-day period agreed upon when he was appointed may not be enough for their application, the leader of the conservative party "New Democracy" of the New Economy, Antonis Samaras, assured the new leaders that he will not support the new
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on October 26, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will be crowned tomorrow with a vote of confidence by the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase the employment of the population, reforms of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras' message does not clarify any doubts about his position: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything."
The Conservative leader has taken one step further in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, the organizations that are supposed to unfreeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has explained that he will not give his approval to any letter of consent to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect of the Papandreou-style referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unequivocal: it will not resume aid unless the new government and the leaders of Greece’s main parties sign a possible “written agreement without it.”
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafay said the troika's inspectors could "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what needs to be done to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been set.
In the Greek club enough threads for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen underlined Spain’s “main” position on this type of finance
Spain "has taken a prominent place in the world in the field of microfinance."
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades the country has become the second largest donor in terms of instruments of cooperation, whose "essence", she said, is that it is "an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all mankind, based on the faith of people."
The Queen opened the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such actions are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and "absolutely more so than the people, especially with the goal of
Spain is "still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on this task with all "responsibility", says Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements that have emerged during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "provide these women with special abilities and better opportunities for the poorest."
There are “many achievements” and “many difficulties we face.”
The microcredit summit is becoming not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that contributes to the "two main goals".
Thus, Her Majesty has explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will benefit from these financial services and 100 million of these households will get out of the poverty into which they are plunged.
The impetus for the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and around the world "went along the path begun years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Ms. Sofia, as "an act of justice and recognition".
And she described the instrument’s father as “a staggering idealist in the universal cause of poverty,” whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy on the spot.
This experience was taken over a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I've seen continuous development everywhere," said Her Majesty, whose ties to this project led her to the title of "head of seven" yesterday.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech, urging those present to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
“The Ethical Imperative”
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity is an "ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries with the times of the economic boom, as it is a “permanent commitment”.
Himenes concluded that microcredit implies a “serious and firm course to eradicate poverty” and that now “more than ever” developed country governments must work in solidarity and not allow it to fall victim to cost cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main areas of cooperation for development".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, highly appreciated the "success" in giving "confidence" to people "disabled, before whom all the doors are closed", and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier de la Riva, greeted the two who "welcome all the present".
CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program, but arose in the autumn itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that the government’s policy is far from being as strict as it should be, today with regard to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with regard to Italy.
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, tabled for discussion by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovations, which lasted a few minutes, which were deserved by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, Europhile and Finance Minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “it’s time for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This may mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty that make it possible to strengthen the European Union’s control over the financial policies of the euro area countries, but it could also affect the elections of the President of the European Commission by a general vote, “to give Europe a face”.
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree to this decision; the UK is opposed to it, and CDU leaders believe Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed to it.
But the soil is prepared.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member country on the board of the European Central Bank according to the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wishing to calm the situation in her party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty, which like to criticize "high-minded" Germany.
Although a whole paragraph in the draft resolution on Europe is devoted to the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just bypassing.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is a hospital bill fraud?
Following the bailouts, the UMP and the government launched an assault on hospital records.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefit Fund and give a speech on this issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on the fight against social benefit fraud.
And to help this offensive, which arose from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also part of the right-wing campaign for re-election to the presidency, the majority wants to focus on the hospital sheets.
First of all, in view of budget savings, the government intends to impose on employees of private companies the fourth day of unpaid leave before the payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employer, the sick worker will lose his salary in four days, equal to a minimum of 15% of his/her monthly income.
The measure, which threatens to generate a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will lead to savings of 280 million euros.
And that will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely imposing on public servants one day without the payment of sickness benefit (public servants have not yet had to wait for the payment of the benefit, in contrast to the three-day expectation of private sector workers).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority are also re-referring to the topic of fraud, with a view to abuse in the issuance of hospital records.
Control will become tougher and if you are caught, you will have to return all illegal payments you have received," Xavier Bertrand warned on RTL on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital records.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subject to constant control and political attacks that bear fruit.
People in France are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
First, let’s look at the figures for the country.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economic Research and Documentation, daily compensation expenditures of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion in 2008 amounted to 5% of total health expenditures.
Of this amount, 46% were related to maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% to sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 thousand million euros.
And, therefore, they accounted for 2.5% of health-related expenditures.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic, which hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the career management website Monster.com, found that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single day of hospitalization.
Another study, this time on health insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of hospitals lasted less than 8 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
If you compare these figures with the figures of European neighbours, you can see that French workers are no more likely to take hospitalized than workers in any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001, the overall share of absenteeism in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10% and 11%, compared to 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital leaves is very low compared to “gray” employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 led to a systematic review of hospitals lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term disease findings were "unjustified" or too long, or 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital sheets for more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unreasonable", equal to 132,000.
In total, 169,000 cases were “unreasonable” for several million workers who received hospital records.
Figures that show very few cases compared, for example, with figures of "gray" employment.
According to UMP MP Dominick Tiana, author of the report on this issue in June, they amount to 9 to 15 billion euros of unearned budget revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than the losses from fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow a new plan for settlement
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
This was stated in parliament on Monday 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition government were not enough to carry out this task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” said the head of the government, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 should be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's presence in the eurozone is "put on the map", he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos predicts a reduction in the country’s budget deficit “to about 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Left rejects the new government's measures
On Monday, Antonios Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the tasks of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that hinders the recovery of the economy.
Ollie Renou, the European commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid, says the Committee of Experts
Canadians refused to die, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
As for palliative medicine, the committee argues that the government, health institutions and doctors are working together to provide the best palliative care, not counting cancer cases.
Canadians are not allowed to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee proposes that the Government amend the penal code to allow for suicide with outside assistance and euthanasia where such a choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient may be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, the experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that “medicalization of death in Canada has given birth to a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Because of medicalization or not, but 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and foreign-assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that it contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and foreign-assisted suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse of application, that is, euthanasia or suicide with foreign assistance against people who cannot or do not want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference that the majority of such cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Foreign-assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, Jocelyn Downey explains.
Canadians for euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians advocate euthanasia because, according to Angus Reid’s 2010 survey, they believe it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not be a signal that the lives of older people or people with disabilities have less value.
With regard to people who assisted in suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Criminal Code should establish that a legally legitimate termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for refusing end-of-life care without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the committee calls on the government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to alleviate physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some experts in the field of health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschan, an expert on health legislation, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme" because, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to fatal cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says meter Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place personality independence above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that “there are warning signs and prohibitions in society.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expresses “a categorical disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called a “manifest for euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, in particular, the data of the report concerning abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to cede power
Damascus condemns 'conspiracy'
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a demonstration in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria by Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, is resisting him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country, has intensified.
Two days after Syria’s suspension of membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria’s neighbors Turkey and Jordan called for President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to cede power in Syria, where about 40 more civilians and members of the regime’s armed forces were killed.
“If Bashar were to have expensive interests in his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new stage of political life,” Jordan’s neighboring king told the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey’s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, were not successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, hinting at Syria, a neighbouring country towards which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “expanding consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries like Turkey are taking a tougher course against repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the regime’s armed forces were killed in the Deraa area in southern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed in gunfire and heavy machine guns in Jobara in the besieged town of Homs, according to the NGO.
During the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Muallem said that the country is nearing the end of the crisis.
In addition, he reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which, he said, is a "dangerous step".
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this plot against Syria will fail.
After its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires the entry into the country of 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also spoke out in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he said fell into "paranoia".
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan to exit the crisis, adopted on 2 November, which includes, inter alia, the withdrawal of armed forces from cities where fighting is going on and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League's decision "incorrect" on Thursday, while China urged Syria to implement a plan to exit the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.

Monti takes time from markets and victims from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and execute a program that will require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s reign.
The former European commissioner took part in a discussion with political parties yesterday ahead of today’s meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrats who are not members of parliament.
Monti spoke about the importance of the program, which involves many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participate in the discussions after meeting with the candidate for prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament to vote in confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monti presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday’s nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them for time.
“Democracy needs time to prepare the government and the program,” he said, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understandable.
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but the concern resurfaced, particularly after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include "politicians."
The new government will have to act until 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of confidence from the parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti guaranteed that once he took office, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important player in Europe.
The representative of the European Commissioner Ollie Ren stressed that "despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed".
The European Union, convinced that Rome will not implement the planned budget for 2013, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, has demanded, in particular, new strict measures.
Italian boss Emma Marchegalia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters."
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as a European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents the "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism", "professor", symbolizing the "challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the authors of the Predovics.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid early elections, as by April 2012, Italy must make payments on government debts amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200,000 million.
Russian Scientist Helped Iran’s Nuclear Program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, a U.S. agency specializing in nuclear danger confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the UN agency to establish the identity of this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, relying largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, "since the sixties, at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds explosion methods".
In 1989 or 1991 he left the center to create a company producing "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
His company’s financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, until returning to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA said there were “clear signs that Iran’s development of the nuclear detonator system was facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well, but who also told the agency that he had been working most of his career on this technology as part of his home country’s military nuclear program.”
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to the FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined or did not change over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is an increase of 49%, compared with an increase of 13% in cases of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4% in attacks on Jews and an overall increase of 14% in the number of crimes on religious grounds.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After the decline in 2009, there is concern that the number of these crimes is increasing again, Human Rights First said, “the increase in cases of violence against Muslims is particularly significant,” the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered as serious human rights violations,” said Paul Legrand, one of the leaders of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to address these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reporting on hate crimes.”
“Hatred crimes” in federal law are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, skin color, religion, nationality and sexual orientation today.
Twitter is changing its platform and becoming similar to Facebook.
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to its platform’s presentation, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, which makes the service similar to Facebook.
The new “Activity” tab and other “names” make it easier and more direct to track the activity of other “Twitters”, Internet users whose messages (“Twitters”) you follow, and those who follow yours.
This makes it possible to know if they will publish messages, if they will subscribe to new accounts, if they will have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before it went on wide use across the network on Monday, AFP spokeswoman Caroline Penner said.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively quite incomprehensible and as using rather vague terms (RT for posturing someone else’s profile, #followfriday for recommending to track other users), is basically bringing pleasure to more experienced users by Google, thus opening itself up to a wider audience.
On the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of "tweets" on the Internet.
“It’s useless, obsessive, and overly reminiscent of Facebook.”
Functional activity will help me better follow certain elements of my Twitter stream, <0x40>dannykronstrom wrote.
Austro-Hungarian
Introduction of the “golden rule” budget into the constitution
The leadership of a large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to enshrine a budget “golden rule” in the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade by state credit rating agencies (Austria).
Chancellor Werner Faymann personally announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers meeting, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, which is significantly higher than the upper threshold of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the public debt of countries such as Italy.
If Austria’s solvency had fallen by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,000 million more each year, the Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister of the Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger argued.
Thus, Austria meets the demand of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; the heads of state and government have called for the reduction of budget deficits by the end of 2012 and the return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The ruling adopted by the Austrian government is reminiscent of the "German model" since Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced every year by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and from 2017 the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and the land, like the municipalities, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to make the public debt fall below the 60% mark set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esihiko Noda
threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Eshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would carry out new interventions in the foreign exchange market if the value of the yen continues to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of the yen, explained Mr. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose almost to the historic mark that prompted Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On this day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which set a new record for power since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown steadily, driven by the purchases of investors who perceive it as a “refugee” in these turbulent times of the global downturn and Europe’s debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the latest intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar cost about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converting into the national currency.
"Japan is fighting to recover itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), Mr. Noda said, fearing that this yen growth would kill a fragile recovery germ.
The world's third-largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to growth in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect “Japan’s fundamental economic indicators.”
Finance Minister Jun Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But Hirohide Yamaguchi, the deputy managing director of the institution, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate steps" by making it clear that no further mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47 thousand million euros), raising to 55,000 thousand million yen (519 thousand euros) the ceiling of the amounts it allocates to purchase various financial instruments to saturate the market.
Eurozone
rates are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating
The risk of a debt crisis is undermining European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in volatile countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro zone, European exchanges left on Tuesday, November 15, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4% and ended trading at 3,064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
Due to the new difficulties with the payment of loans by euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Concerned investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop under new market participants’ doubts about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has set its sights on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in a corridor of narrow change until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return to concern about the future of the euro zone is beating the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest point in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency had cost $1.3570, falling by 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after the congress of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party on Monday, which adopted a resolution that provides, in particular, the possibility for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly higher than 6%
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a high level of concern.
This morning on Tuesday, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and the yield of Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel participants’ fears.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the time exchanges to restore the situation in Italy, which is at risk of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain was under fire from markets ahead of parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between interest rates on Germany’s and Spain’s 10-year debt obligations has reached a new historic high.
Waiting for growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, despite this, revised in the direction of a decline in the second quarter, with a fall in 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire euro area is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
The Energy Policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be made after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings are becoming an occasion to reflect on the share and place occupied by nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options have been studied.
France must build its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
With 7 billion people on the planet, demographic development will double the need for electricity by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to compensate for the growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue the production of electricity continuously, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalance - a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who are resolutely continuing their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one plant to its set, resuming the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident on Tri-Mill Island.
Although Germany’s model based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the rise in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will already be noticeable.
Consider the example of Denmark.
The European champion in the construction of turbines, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, it is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; due to which the emissions of carbon dioxide and electricity prices are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the average in Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy the price of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of service of industrial equipment on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will lead to a great increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this kind of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country's energy policy has made it possible to create an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect ones.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole host of specialized international trade small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France decided to give up nuclear power, it would have to donate a large number of these enterprises and lose <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrical engineer would order an EPR, designed to work for sixty years, if it was planned to close its manufacturer?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must recognize that there are no divine or devilish sources of energy production.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the interoperability of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of security for nuclear energy is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same obsession with safety.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mill Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any consequences for humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the device of the reactor and the unforgivable human error led to the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it has drawn from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the security authorities, the operators and the French and German designers, EPR, presents a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all the energy experts who want to build the reactor, stopping its construction in Flamenville will be a great gift to competitors Areva and EDF, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased maneuvers to prevail in a dispute that is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a good for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various sides – the overload of police, judicial and administrative services subordinate to the policy of numbers and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a “human rights state”.
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which got into the news releases when the Minister of the Interior (Liberation of May 23) said that France "does not need foreign talents, stonemasons and waiters".
However, it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The left and right agree on a lot of things.
Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 declared that “900,000 unemployed people will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers”, and Michel Rocar on the left, who explained in 1990 that France “cannot accept the poor from all over the world”.
The difference is only in the level of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invasion of the country by the Polish hordes of plumbers was felt by both the left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they allow to show to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande confined himself to banality, saying that “joint work will solve our immigration problem.”
This notion of immigration as both a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but economically it is very expensive.
As we are reminded by economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron in a recent book, which summarized the latest data on immigration (Special people: How migration shaped our world and will determine our future, May 2011, the publisher of Princeton University Growth, 352 c.), there is a broad consensus among experts.
Restriction of immigration leads to weakened growth and reduced employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the notion that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled ones, provoking lower wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants supplement much more than they replace the local workforce, performing jobs for which the local workforce is lacking.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, and the most skilled - in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity existing between locals and immigrants leads to the fact that the arrival of immigrants positively affects the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in the migration flow leads to an increase of 0.6-0.9% in real long-term wages.
And this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (among the American Nobel laureates, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also bring net profits to social security systems, giving an average of 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, in Germany, an immigrant, arriving at the age of 30, will bring the state budget a net profit (income minus expenses) of an average of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 in his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy at the beginning of his term was going to cling to the missing growth points with his "toothes".
The aforementioned teeth, which were used to scare off immigrants, gave exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to understand European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but at the same time it is fragile.
The European continent must remember that, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it was enough to arrange a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since the time of Napoleon the "Little" it is known that this comes from the superficiality of thinking.
Universal voting, while a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient prerequisite for it and may even become a “tool of oppression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Washro once said.
No, democracy requires much more – public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but first and foremost it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinody of a false-true Greek referendum will have a double debunking effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious change in policy and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted and, according to many, Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We will gain nothing by demanding a series of national referendums, organised as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Card-blanche" for an absolute European monarch or jump with tied legs into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we are not dreaming of a guillotine blade, but of a common, clear and continuous implementation of choice and democracy, this time at a pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - the crisis of Europe.
Europe as a whole is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to restore the management of the European project to the sovereignty of the people.
Because only by working together, Europeans will be able to reduce everyone’s debt burden, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
Getting out of the crisis will require decisions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the Socialists and Jacques Delores are now all demanding a European economic government.
Let's go.
But to imagine it without stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has come into being, is another madness and a new impasse.
We need to start a new phase of European integration.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains in force.
We must build a Europe that is united at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a real people’s European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are spreading more and more.
The world chip-card exhibition opens on Tuesday in Wilpente near Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with 11% growth in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 billion units.
The most important is the contactless technology sector, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases by simply mapping the reader device.
This year, 460 million contactless cards will be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will make up almost 10% of the world chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of contactless payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest position: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are in circulation.
But the big stores are growing at a faster pace.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards.
To move to a higher speed, banks need to supply their customers with equipment.
“Two large organisations in France have pledged to systematically distribute contactless credit cards to their customers in the future,” said Gerard Nebouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the development of the future means of payment, that is, a mobile phone.
At the moment, only a few devices are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary for such transactions.
“They were postponed.
“But they really have to fly away next year.”
“We expect worldwide sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June of the following year in Cannes.
The iPhone devices of about 200 customers and employees will be provided with cases that provide contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch an offer that allows its customers to pay via mobile phones.
Terrorist Front Spreads from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-awaited links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algerians are now confident.
“The way these two organizations use and the intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without going into detail.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January revealed two links.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocure and Vincent Delori were apparently killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone sim cards belonging to the terrorists.
Here's the terror
The analysis of the calls indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we certainly need to wait for more reliable evidence before we talk about the operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect receives financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly apparent from the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of lethal and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community, led by Washington, is now putting pressure on Abuja to focus on the problems that Boko Haram is creating.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as an uninteresting community of educated people.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri under the mosque, school and imam fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is a sin" - preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict adherence to Sharia law, and its activists have begun a fight against the wicked central government.
It is aimed mainly at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalized and will go beyond its northern shepherds.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Jose, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram organized the first suicide bomber attack on a fortified police headquarters in Abuja.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a matter of concern to all security experts.
Today, with the Aqmi fortified in Mali and Niger and the Somalis from al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan Allen Juppe warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed readiness to share all available information.
The world as seen by Republican presidential candidates
With respect to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world with simple, or rather simplistic ideas?
If you listen to presidential candidates from Republicans, voters could believe it.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying out loud, but devoid of details, statements on foreign policy, which have traditionally been the strong side of Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and aid to Israel are often mixed with each other.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being promoted from the “Old Good Party,” has threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of “manipulating their currency is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries of its industry to Asia.
“It’s even worse if it leads to a trade war,” he said.
John Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a complex foreign policy background, was unable to overcome an emotional stance.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who remains at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard of.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb.”
He also pledged to strengthen military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to deliver on promises made to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, second in the ranking of candidates, has demonstrated a discouraging ignorance of the matter.
He recently called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power – obviously not knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
To resort to torture of suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 are also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight of foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to reduce his tone in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the “boys” from Iraq, his tricks in Libya, which brought him a reputation as a weak politician.
But the offensive is not that easy.
The population considers a positive balance of national security under Obama, who eliminated Ben-Ladin.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are tied in the sand.
And claiming that America needs to be economically restructured to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
The North Stream, a new gateway for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The North Stream pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea has been launched.
It is designed to supply the equivalent of 30 million households with gas.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between the orchestra’s performance and exquisite snacks, in the opening of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch colleague, Mart Rutte, together turned the symbolic valve controlling the inflow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
Under the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of gas will be supplied to Western Europe each year via the first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The second pipeline is expected to be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas equivalent to all of France’s consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream will indeed deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: it will be harder for them to influence Russia, threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Stream with the new "German-Soviet Pact", hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin with the aim of occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is striving for greater security of supply.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, which consume large volumes of gas and whose own reserves are already at an end.
“This gas pipeline is part of the cooperation with Russia, it’s a new artery that organically connects us,” said Francois Fillon, opening the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel enclosed in concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left from the Second World War.
“A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
There was also a need to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metallic snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, without breaks along its entire length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not thrilled that the Russian state-owned company would settle off its shores forever.
“In the event of an accident, we will cut off the flow of gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
So, in case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But this seems unlikely to the designers who designed the seams designed to leak only once every 100,000 years.
Control over the state of the gas pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot, which pulls the ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigar-shaped apparatus is introduced into the pipeline with a diameter of 1 meter and pushed forward by the flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it gives accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is carried out only at the expense of its pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Dutch Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies set up a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was commissioned to build and operate the pipeline.
Its headquarters are located in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Then Gazprom leased this company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
“Gasprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas is actually being transported,” says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and by 70% bank loans.
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand million euros for two pipelines.
The investment of GDF Suez will be around 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay for their costs, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The pipeline exits from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to a sandy shore planted with conifers.
The valves 4.5 meters high form the gas outlet terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine brand notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company fifteen years ago, will return the taste of the letter.
It has the scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notepad is easy to recognize by the rectangular black cover, the rubber band, the yellowish-white pages, as if yellowed over time.
However, Moleskine’s notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to launch the design notebooks for sale.
Maria Sebregondi, the then consultant of the company, took responsibility for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique, moleskin - lacquered cotton fabric, used, for example, to cover the bedsheets.
It is claimed that this type of notebook is highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought into line with today’s taste the old and forgotten thing that was a cult for avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the managing director of Modo Modo.
Success is here.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% to reach 12.7 million units.
We have gone far from the production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed the borders of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Setting up a typical buyer profile is difficult, because the notebook equally attracts a businessman, a student, and a freelancer.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in the centers of small towns and has been able to gain widespread fame.
“We have followed the spirit of time and this new need in the letter, despite the advent of email,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural trait accompanies the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized the exhibition "The Round Path", where architects and artists showed their own notebooks.
In August, he also released leopard-painted covers for the Locarno Film Festival.
Using its successes and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags. The brand includes all kinds of support.
Success that gave rise to envy: in the fall of 2006 Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which made a new page in Moleskine history.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for disabled people begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the rate of unemployment among persons with disabilities is still twice the average, 19 per cent versus 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Dissatisfied?
“No,” says Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for people with disabilities.
"Serious progress has been made in 15 years."
"At that time, the share of unemployed was not 2, but 3 times more."
“There is still a lot of work ahead.”
I have to say that there is still a lot of obstacles for the disabled in employment.
Among them, more seniors: 37% over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a rather low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor’s degree, and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85% for people with disabilities versus 38% on average.
In short, all of these are criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are the essence of the problem,” said Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that is changing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association on behalf of Cité found that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and "imagined solid people in wheelchairs either mentally or mentally disabled."
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from having the goal of having 6% of disabled workers set out in the law adopted in 1987.
The last known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
“Today we are about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxable" organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased in 2007-2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which raised taxes, put a lot of pressure on the company,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects an increase in awareness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with the number of employees from 20 to 49 have disabled employees compared to 82% of organizations with the number of employees from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before battling the Blues on Tuesday evening (8:45 p.m.), Eden Azar and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the arena of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after the departure of his striker in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
“I am very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he is Belgian.”
“I want to go further,” says Lilly’s player.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the national team, it is one whole, - he justifies.
“I’ve been in Lille all year and not in Belgium.”
“I have to earn points.”
Leaving in reserve, in anticipation of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar arrived in Saint-Denis to finally "blink".
Not forgetting, however, the concept of "pleasure".
He has supported the Blues since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always supported them,” he says.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this game.
And especially the fact that on the other side there are Mathieu (Debushi), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
“Our roads just crossed.”
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly recalled the "pride".
"Pride" to play in a "party match."
"Pride" also claims as a "neighbor" that France "has become a very high-level team again" just a year after the injury at Nijmegen.
"Laurent Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, a technical athlete will fly in a blue-guided plane... to Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll see that in future matches, including this one against France."
Portugal is very confident in itself.
Portugal’s Paulo Bento starts his rematch against Bosnia (22.00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
“By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paul Bent is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the national team, which he has led since September 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to be played and there is a Bosnia to be won.
With 0-0 on Friday in Zenica's hell, it's clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the cherished goal that would have reassured it.
“It’s a good result, which, however, carries a certain risk.”
But at their brightly lit de la Luz stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be thrilled, although the match will be very tense,” said optimistic but reasonable Bentu.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012," said the successor of Carlos Keiros.
Nobody on Friday in the match against Bosnia demands a victory from the Portuguese.
No one could have beaten the Bosnians.
"It's a good result, but there's some risk," Bent said.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical merits and players who have a lot of individual merits," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning, "not give them time to think".
It's a good idea, just to make it realistic this time.
