In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that researchers used it as a starting point and compared the three other treatments up against it.

This confirmed, not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that this animal's feather suit was chestnut brown on the upper with a pale or carotenoid-colored lower part.
The finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers when it comes to birds.
Since the dinosaur feather does not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other properties of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers assumed that rachis was most likely a later evolutionary development than these other properties.
The feathers' structure assumed that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers assumed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show adult feather suit and not down from a young bird.
Scientists assume that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show adult plumage and not down from a young bird.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of tidal force between the galaxy and the Milky Way's dark material.
In the same way that the moon exerts a pull force on Earth that causes tidal waves, the Milky Way exerts a pull force on the galaxy Sagittarius.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affected other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of glorie, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed paper seat indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot form.
French electoral law codifies treatment relatively strictly.
Since 1988, voice boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes there at the beginning of the voice procedure and that no envelopes are added except those from carefully numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to follow each part of the process. In the evening, the voices are counted by volunteers under close observation and by following specific procedures.

The weapon of the week failed while aiming at a fifth man's head. Schneider has ongoing pain, blindness in one eye, missing parts of the skull and a face that has been reconstructed by titanium.
Schneider testified through a video link from the U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
After Wednesday's event, Carpanedo has competed in two individual laps in the championships.
Her first was a slalom where she received an 'unfinished' in her first round. 36 of 116 competitors had the same result in that round.
In her second lap, grand slalom, she came in tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than winner Claudia Loesch, from Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth place Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to complete their ride, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in grand slalom failed to rank in the run.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant police inspector general D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who chose the Swiss woman and have found her laptop and mobile phone."
The defendants are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki has said that the accused had appeared in court with their face covered.
Although three people were on the inside of the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver of the car suffered serious head injuries.
The road where she crashed was temporarily closed while nude state services freed the driver from the rough Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was moved to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with murdering her son in Edinburgh's Court of Appeals.
She is in custody pending trial and trial, but evidence from eyewitnesses may be manipulated as images of her have been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's legal system seems different and the court has considered the publication of images as possibly prejudiced.
Professor at the University of Dundee, Pamela Ferguson, said "journalists seem to take a dangerous direction if they publish photos and the like of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Authority, which has the collective responsibility for prosecutors, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be given at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Pakistan wishes based on the pre-Middle East War 1967 borders.
Other topics covered, according to reports, include the future of the State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the conflict over the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed while the Palestinian authorities have only agreed on such a presence for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control trial project were to be closely monitored by weighers while the effectiveness of the trial project was assessed and monitored.
In a partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sports Shooter Organization of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited to the Sports Shooter Organization's hunting program.
According to the Acting Director of Park Protection and Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the first four selected shooters of the first shooter operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly sworn in a new Provisional Election Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional council election in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to hire the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to a widespread anti-regime protest that began in October.
The sometimes elective protest was triggered when no elections had been held, some dating back to 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods that have been overheated have been reported, which has led to a total of six fires and that four people have experienced minor burns.
The Department of Economics of Japan, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Commerce and Industry Department announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more cases of overheating that the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "particularly regrettable".
The earthquake framed Marianne at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Department, no injuries to the community were reported.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former police officer from the Philippines took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza used an M16 gun as he shot the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, but it has been confirmed that at least six people have died so far.
Six hostages, the children and the elders, were released at an early stage, and so were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it could prompt the maturation of the lungs of the fetus.
Xinhua reported Wednesday that government investigators had found the two ‘black boxes' with the plane's audio recordings.
Other athletes also hailed Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on a night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong Woman."
Dustin "Golden Dust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as me...maybe even more...loves her and will slow her down...hopefully she's in a better place."
Based on a poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, it emerged that the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 campaign for the federal election that she believed Australia should be a republic outside of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those participating in the opinion poll shared this view and wished Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Asutralia.
At most, 29 percent of those polled thought Australia should be a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent thought Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim in 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but as a result of his complaints, question marks have been seen at his form.
He has not been able to take the necessary medications to overcome the pain, as they are illegal in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Thursday.
Comets may have been a source of water supplies to Earth, along with organic material that can shape proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets take shape, especially how Earth took shape since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his position as governor earlier this month and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumor as "political talk and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the U.S. Aviation Control claims can allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground radar-based technology to allow aviation controllers to locate aircraft with better precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport facilities have been put in place and trains over the ground will not stop at Wembley, as well as parking and parking with transport is not available on site.
Fears of lack of transport have raised the possibility that the matches will take place behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported a formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Gal<0xC3><0xA1>pagos Islands.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new bird species was developed after only two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, as a result of breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, the mid-earth spruce, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostis.
Gold can be prepared for any formation. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be spun into thin threads that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered and rolled out into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it can sometimes be used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator by using jus of red cabbage.
The cabbage candle changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The PH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H's in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir the two dry powders together to then squeeze them together into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo had a flush toilet in almost every single house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of the sewage system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were present together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles awake you use a satellite.
The satellite that is in space receives the call so as to reflect it down again, almost bypassing.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space when the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our sight.
It requires a large rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster possibilities for transportation.
It has given us the train, the car and many other transport devices.
Among them there are more medium-sized cats as a medium-sized prey, ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) as a much more varied selection of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special job every cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live together in large groups called flocks.
Groups are formed by one to three adult male lions, along with as many as thirty lioness and their young.
The lionesses are usually related to each other, and are a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave very similar to a wolf herd or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a particularly flexible athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not so well), swim, run long distances and draw by five times the power of a strong human being.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as the roar of lions, but more like a sentence of roaring, gauling words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They like to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than these.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (exchange) using smells, they turn upside down to wherever they have been on the ground.
They have a night vision that allows them to see very well at night, and also move very smoothly. Ozelots hunt by camouflage themselves in the environment while wondering about their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) are separated from the main population they came from (such as if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that it is difficult for them to return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they came from.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors which means that the new population will need other characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor, than those they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all taken, they need to continue the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population has begun to adapt to their new environment, causing them to become more and more different from the other population.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process of species formation, which means the formation of new species. Species formation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen as human spirits, and they take in carbon dioxide as human spirits out (in other words, exhalation).
Plants make their food from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plantar. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was a top consumer at the time, so he feared nothing – except for other Mosasaurs.
The long jaw of males was surrounded by more than 70 sharp teeth, and with an extra set in the cheek. In other words, there was no way out for those who crossed the road.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a split tongue. The diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs. He may even have been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that landed in the water – even giant dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus rex, were no matter to him.
However, while most of their food would be known to us, the Romans had some unusual rights to their feast meals, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called sjusovar.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting, the rich men enjoyed having banquets together while lying on their side when eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe or America from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa and no Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods which was considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to take care of the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and an inner sanctuary to which only priests had access.
Sometimes separate pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not particularly important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family passed outside.
The women did the cooking in the courtyard; shops were only open disks aimed at the street. Stones were used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In the Norse blessings it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Although he made this discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at this time.
Although each of the countries was ‘Scandinavian’, there were great differences between people, kings, customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film The National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not correct. Even if there is something written on the back, there is no tax map.
Writing on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one can say for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (it measures 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches times 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) early in its lifetime was rolled together for storage.
So it is likely that the listing was simply added as a tag.
The D-day landings and you the following battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the French Vichy regime; these were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and independent French forces had liberated the southern part of France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization one is a single culture shared by a group of people of a significant size living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, or means civil, related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizens, and civitas, meaning city or city state, and in a way also defines the size of society.
City states are the drivers of nations. A civilized culture insinuates the dissemination of knowledge across several generations, a tarnished cultural imprint, and fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and failure to be known as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the decisions of the Confederacy.
Congress lacked any power to introduce taxes, and as there was no executive or judiciary, it relied on government authorities, which were often uncooperative then, to enforce all of its decisions.
Nor did it have authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The decisions required unanimous consent from all states before they could be changed, and the states took so lightly on the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team are the second most successful football teams in the world, and were FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in the international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
As a result of the clusters/groups of islands Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geological perspective, as an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan goes all the way back to the 15th century when European sailors who passed registered the name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which set in motion a transformation of the indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces from the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which conferred sovereignty over Taiwan on Japan, which ruled the country until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple, and the Space with the three windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like initially.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed and the conversion process continued to the present day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog era.
It is still produced today, but even more important is that its side conditions have been inherited by digital cameras' sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actual, slightly confusing, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided into twelve to obtain the simplest complete ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats for example) are similar to, or about the same, as this aspect ratio.
The much criticized and often ridiculed rule that thirds are a simple guideline that creates dynamics while keeping a measure of order in images.
It says that the most effective location for the main topics is at the intersection of the lines, which divides images into three parts vertically and horizontally (see examples).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, fell under investigation.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound together European states, despite differences in languages and customs.
It had an all-embracing power that affected everyone from king to ordinary citizen.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church are there for precisely this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was met.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective when it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade broke with the generally accepted international laws, codified by several small international agreements over the past two decades.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent all ships from sailing into the entire sea area and inflicted damage on even neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most residents were pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the brutality and heartbreak of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents for his name, a book of poetry, and a certificate from Charles Batchelor (his former manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each step of China and each family in power became a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty there was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the three kingdoms epoch that took place for 60 years, between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was outrageous warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China's history, thousands of people died while fighting to sit on the highest seat of the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism and republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions were also open to all male seekers, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military when ranking was now based on skills rather than class, as they had been before.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people, from oppressed working classes in other countries, to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters outside of his everyday life. He often used a mine known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to grub.
The mine itself, which survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual decay.
The mine sits on top of the mountains north of the Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all taken, even if you know it exists. When you are on the inside of the mine, you are completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen but clear, beautiful clouds above, and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the mine.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, and is one of the many pyramid structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau or "Giza necropolis" in the Egyptian valley of the dead contains several pyramids (hence the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was designed to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" mark looks like a V and "down-bow" mark as if a pin or square is missing at the bottom of it.
Up means you should start at the top and push the book, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the book) and drag the book.
An up-bow usually makes a softer sound, while down-bow is stronger and more determined.
Make your own labels, but remember that the labels are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
They terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789, by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob of humans forced the king and queen to have the windows of the carriage completely open.
At one point, a member of the mob held up the head of a royal guard, who was killed in Versailles, in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines, were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cost a large portion of the expenses, and the interest in bonds embarrassed in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking system.
The superprofit derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would, of course, constitute the basic achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templars, one must understand the context that facilitated the formation of the order.
The era when these events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages came after the early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technology promotion or the technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific law and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technology's development itself follows a path far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology again has "effects" on society that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you can say that the motor car will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable to serve only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
General car ownership also leads to higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the health care system discovering new techniques for treating injured people.
Romance had a great element of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, which were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation for being an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
This status was reduced during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of fashion capital, from Constantinople to Paris, took place.
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, dress was highly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
Due to slow communication channels, the styles of the West could hang on by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. one of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusaders, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture for livelihood is agriculture that is practiced for the production of enough food to only meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Agriculture for life support is a simple, often organic system that uses stored seeds coming from the eco-region combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for subsistence and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals, who feel neglected by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to highlight the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or mistreatment intentionally, were not socialized by adults when they grew up.
Such children are called "wild" or offsized. Some wild children have been constrained by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this surrender was by children as a result of their parents' rejection of a child's serious, intellectual or physical difficulties.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or trauma, before being surrendered or escaped.
Others have been claimed to be bred by animals; some have been meant to have lived alone in the open.
When fully reared by non-human animals, children exhibit wild behavior (within physical limitations) almost entirely similar to the current care animals, such as fear of or indifference to humankind.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, constructivist design learning takes a step further.
Constructive design is not a learning method, but rather a tool that makes support for individuals who are engaged in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Stillas can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but the same is the little binder man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software and are intended to put question marks at, lead, and figure out procedures that could have been too demanding for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of causes ranging from neglect, to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We look at the Child Protection Regulations as a safety zone for these children.
Our Child Welfare Regulations are intended to provide safe homes, loving caregivers and stable education, as well as reliable health care.
Foster homes a designed to cover all the needs that were lacking in the home they were taken away from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet led to several dimensions in terms of the approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations for online use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects of Eighmey and McCord (1998) when examining audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, movements in the face lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting the micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his dissertation The President's speech, indicated how a person who is unable to understand the speech as a result of brain injury, however, is able to assess free speech correctly.
He even suggests that such skills for interpreting human behavior may be shared by domestic animals such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two stocks of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the stock of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination move the variation back and forth between the two stores with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system as human beings to meet their need for amino acid from the available plant resources.
Moreover, it has serious consequences if one fails with this: growth depression, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
The most available panther resources would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, not only animal food (ants, termites, eggs) are digestible, but they make a high number of proteins containing all the necessary amino acids.
Given all this, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as the chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of waking up intentionally during your normal sleep period and falling asleep again shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a silent alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find that you are resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up from the bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, known hydrogenating fluids) before sleep, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person sits inside with hanging opposite the amount of tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute calmness and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana way of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path to all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is god-yoga. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. At the end of the war, they led the conflicting systems, processes and culture to the fact that the countries did not go together.
With two years of the end of the war, the two allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and was fought on real, by detachment forces, on battlefields from America to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along Romanian bridgeheads.
However, these plans were obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace, the Soviet-Polish Multi-Aggressive Pact and other international tracts.
Using ships to transport goods is clearly the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the seas.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move human and good, while at the same time, preventing your enemy's ability to move their human and good.
One of the most recent examples worth noting was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move men and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have managed to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have become domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in Iran's Zagros Mountains.
Animal husbandry was started in ancient cultures to have easy access to milk, hair, meat and leather.
Domesticated goats were normally kept in herds that graze on high-altitude fields or other pastures, often guessed by shepherds who were often children or young – a form of herdsmen. These methods of grazing are still used today.
Railroads of wood were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these rails consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they made it possible for the horses pulling the wagons, to achieve higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat coarser roads that were at the time.
Sviler was introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place, but little by little it was realized that the rails became more effective if they were allowed to puncture a little iron on top.
This thus became common, but the iron caused greater wear on the tricycles of the wagons.
Finally, the tricycles were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made exclusively of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of transport is walking. Man, that is, Homo erectus (<0x3D> the resurrected man), began walking upright two million years ago.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not regularly walk upright.
Two-legged specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to become more kind to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce upcoming burdens to some extent.
This is in many cases the same as treating symptoms. But if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and in that way solve them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind. And problems have become greater due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles in humans.
After Congress passed the declaration on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in front of Independence Hall on 8 July.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who uploaded the document to New York troops on 9 July. On 10 August a copy arrived in London.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides" we know still exist, are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and live today. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But the birds have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have feet with shells and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on the two hind legs just like a T-Rex.
So to say all computers that are in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always easy to detect. Symptoms (such as vomiting) can be so diffuse that it is not possible to give a diagnosis immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning is an open pill box or toxic household chemicals that appear.
Examine the label to find out what kind of first aid you should provide for the substance in question.
In the formal sense, entomologists use the term "insect" for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient knowledge of wall animals, which are insects that are very well adapted to be parasites on humans.
Both predators and wall animals are nidicolae animals, which are adapted to live in nests or the house of the host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, that is, the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
According to research, women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not the best for them, or the best for the child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to adopt the baby away.
Upon adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, allowing another couple to become parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works, through the scientific method. This method serves as a guideline for most of the scientific research.
But not only this. Experimentation is also used. An experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Bible, in Latin.
Aristotle's view of everything that had to do with science was what was accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the West was torn away from the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and the production of these through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, are documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillation generators that will continue with periods where they go in free cycles, even when no external signals are present.
The Hershey and Chase experiments were one of the leading theories that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are kimbane cells.
Only mutations in kimbane cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to see the beautiful landscape, including plant and wildlife.
Examples of activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people take the car and leave small suburbs to travel to work, while others pass them on their way to work at the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport again and again, everyone is in a way connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Research now suggests that this massive CO2 economy has disrupted the biosphere from the stable state that has supported man's evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In in-country countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more basic behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interplay between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow as driver behaviour cannot be predicted one hundred percent surely.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably stable range, so traffic flows are often fairly stable and can be represented roughly mathematically.
A relationship has been established between the three main characteristics in order to represent traffic flow better: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are useful when planning, designing, and using road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly made them easier to avoid enemies, and they found faster food and mate.
Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings back along the body.
This allows them to have several small places to choose from when to hide from predators.
The only insects today that can't bend their wings are eye-catchers and 24-hour flies.
Many thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some believed in him, but many believed it was quite the opposite, that it was the solar system that moved around the Earth, including the sun (and all other stars).
It's not that strange, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world and has more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, some places 9.5 km wide.
As much as 20 percent of all the water that flows out of all the earth's rivers and into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The main year of the Amazon River is 6387 km long, which collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one was able to surpass the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and the forward-looking technical execution.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom wondered at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City State has a population of about 800 and is the smallest independent state in the world with the lowest population.
The Vatican State uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language used by most working in the state, while Latin is often used during religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of the Vatican State are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, as all of these are found in natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Although he also created a theory that they change into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. And of course we also have the metals silver and gold.
You can also have alloys consisting of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so extremely small that there is room for many trillions of them at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was therefore a good friend to many when it was invented.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been downgraded to lower status and less used as newer writing methods have been introduced.
People now write messages on computer screens and never need a pencil sharpener.
After all, we can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When you split the core up again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they like to separate it from each other with little or no influence.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the mares (the dark areas) and thicker under the light areas.
There may be several marshes on the nearest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding out what motivates people, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as we grow up.
Theories look at what it is with certain people who make them want the things they want, and what it is in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of need hierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur when leaders start hiring colleagues with whom they were previously at the same level. At one end of the spectrum you have the leader trying to keep being "one of the gang".
This type of leader has problems making unpopular decisions, correcting employees, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum you have the leader who becomes a person you don't recognize, and who feels that he or she has to change everything the group has been doing, and make it his or her own.
After all, it is the seventh and last leader who is responsible for both ups and downs in the group.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups hold the same superior standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual group members often serve as a point of contact for the nearest physical group.
They often manage themselves more on their own than conventional group members because their groups tend to meet after varying time zones, which may not be met with understanding of the local leadership.
The fact that the group is really "invisible" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109), is also a unique component of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" is the leadership group to which each of the members reports. The invisible group sets the standards for each individual member.
Why should an organization go through such a time-consuming process as establishing a learning organization? One of the goals you will achieve by putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and creativity can flourish.
One result of this process with an organization collaborating to tackle an obstacle is that it leads to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performances.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The field of research is thus narrowed and much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the researchers in the research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that can help us understand processes in the brain.
Although "science fiction" provides powerful associations to artificial intelligence (AI), AI constitutes a very important part of computer science when it comes to maneuvering by means, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research within AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this can be control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from customers as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now commonly used in finance, medicine, engineering, and the military and is embedded in several PC apps and video game apps.
Excursions are a big part of all teaching. It is quite often a teacher could imagine taking the students to places you can not travel by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum objects, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about the trip to the largest city in the state. Each year they build the site, but keep old versions online as a kind of clipping book.
Blogs can also help students get better at writing. Although students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, it usually changes when they get an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to make his writing better to avoid criticism.
Blogging also causes "students to be forced to understand the world around them better". The need to satisfy the audience inspires students to become smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn something beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to material on the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada where they speak two languages. Here you will also find a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and present time.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part houses the untapped and scenic Muskoka.
All this and more highlights Ontario as what foreigners see as the most typical Canadian.
Large areas further north have fairly scattered settlements, and some areas are closest to the audible wilderness.
Here is a comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are residents in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent of its own when it comes to animal and plant life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are linked to France, and known as luxury resorts with beautiful beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it had a great influence on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the regions are linked by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would see as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, taken in the arm, etc.
Be determined when you reject men, and don't be afraid to stand on your own (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the city was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop throughout Morocco.
Around the ancient medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, including tagine, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades, but everything is for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Congo located far east of the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the city streets, especially in the city centre, were covered by lava.
It is relatively safe in Goma, but if you want to travel outside Goma, you must carefully investigate the situation in the province of North Kivu with regard to the ongoing conflict there.
The city is also used as a base camp for those going up to the Nyiragongo volcano, and it is also the starting point for those wishing to take one of the most reasonable trips in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is <0x7E>500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relatively difficult availability, "Timbuktu" is commonly used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a city with a lot of poverty, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the city was added to the World Heritage List of places in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the major stops in Henry Louis Gates' program, Wonders of the African World, which ran on the PBS channel.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities of the rest of the country, since it is more Arabic than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east and Zimbabwe in the north, and to the south it is the Crocodile River that forms the border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with different animal and plant life.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa, and it is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park has nature management fees and entrance fees.
It may also be a good idea to buy a Wild Card, which gives free entry to either selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists view as the main destination of the visit.
The parade of buildings constituting the silhouette of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering column diagram that is revealed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
You get the best view of Hong Kong if you leave the island and take the trip to the Kowloon beach line on the other side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on marshes along the northern coastline.
This was the place the British colonizers took as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest swamp belt in the world, stretching 80 km inland in Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps; they include some of the last remaining populations of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, and about a third is covered with water/moor area.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been an animal and plant reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axe yorks in the area.
Buses run from the bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, run between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since these buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts have small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and solid.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a sloping bridge that extends across the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, the bridge is 378 metres long and has two files that are 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD>s were the most important group of people living in what is now called Eastern Paraguay, where they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed for livelihoods.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous groups such as guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and payagu<0xC3><0xA1> were also found, which survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of Indies", emerged as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted for three hundred years.
Since Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of the distinctiveness and identity of the indigenous people.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place on the Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas polo courts in December.
At other times of the year you can watch tournaments and matches on a smaller scale.
Contact the Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Argentina de Polo to find out more about tournaments and where you can buy tickets to polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) with a fixed exchange rate with the British Pound (GBP).
You can exchange money in the only bank on the islands, in Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West store.
British pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Please contact the owners in advance to find out what is an approved payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange falconry pounds outside the islands, so you should do this before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and in the summer months it is common with temperatures above +30 °C.
Winter can be misleadingly cold. Temperatures rarely go below the freezing point, but the combination of wind and high humidity makes it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no special "rainy" or "dry" seasons. There is about as much rain throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild, and you should not feed or disturb the animals.
The park service asks you to stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how compliant they may look, both bison, deer, elk, bear and the vast majority of large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they have not kept a good enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them the space they need.
In addition, you must be aware that odors attract bears and other animals, so you should avoid taking them with you or making food that smells, and the camp must be kept clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a special situation arose at the port, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave it.
All ships sank, with the exception of a British sailing warship. Nearly 200 American and German human lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the murder of its leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to the fact that Auckland stretches between two ports, there are many beaches there. The most popular are located in three areas.
North Coastal beaches (in the North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe conditions for swimming, and most also have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. Symjing is safe.
The local beer is called "Number One" and is not a complex beer, but good and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to obtain, but New Zealand and Australian wines will probably be a better choice.
Water from the tap is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to get if you want to be on the safe side.
A "flat white" will be remote for an Australian. A small black coffee is espresso, a cappuccino is served with lots of cream whistle (not milk foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate tends to keep the Belgian standard. Fruit jussas are expensive, but good.
Many trips to the reef are arranged throughout the year, and it is rare that damage to the reef occurs as a result.
However, it is advisable to follow the advice of the authorities and follow all signs and warnings.
Cube manatees can be found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of the small town of 1770. Occasionally they can also be found at other times of the year.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, travelers can be sure that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as at a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer package tours that include breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes combined flight and hotel packages.
It is also possible to keep the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or arrange other documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants choose to camp at the festival, and most participants believe this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to what's happening, you need to come early to get tent space near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stage has ended, there may be other places at the festival where music is played until late at night.
Some festivals have their own camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, you should check where the cabin is. Some people will hear it extra well when the vessel passes through the ice. It is very noisy.
A cruise to St. Petersburg gives you some time in the city. There is no requirement for a visa for cruise passengers (check the conditions).
Casinos do what they can to make guests spend as much time and money as possible there. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to figure out the way out.
There are often special prices for food, drinks, and entertainment for guests to keep their spirits up and stay.
Some places spend free drinks with alcohol, but rubbish as known weakens judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who is going to run at higher latitudes or over mountain passes, must know that you can meet on snow, ice or cold degrees.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you can't run in the same way as on bar asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can come in a short time that you can drive yourself stuck.
The sighting can also get worse due to the snow falling or windshields on the route, or when it dogges or forms ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, frigid and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest travel attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In popular use, the term safari refers to traveling on land to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to walk near the cars, and standard equipment will provide good views.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes a little cloudy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A hiking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") involves hiking that can last for a few hours or for several days.
Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in different parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as they also hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the games were postponed, it can be difficult.
The rules for cancellations vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation rules based on the coronavirus do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2500 JPY and 130,000 JPY, with the most common tickets costing around 7,000 JPY.
Moist clothes can get drier if you iron them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards on loan, although you won’t always find them in your room.
If you can't borrow an iron, or if you don't want to use ironed socks, you may want to try using a hair dryer.
Be careful not to get the substance too hot (something that can cause the substance to shrink or, at worst, make burn marks in it).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it keeps the water boiling for one minute, while in others, it must be boiled for several minutes.
Filter efficiency varies, and if you don't feel completely safe, consider buying bottled water with seal from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from home.
Pests can destroy food, be to irritation or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans by force, normally do not qualify as pests.
In customs- and duty-free trade, you can buy goods exempt from customs and duties in certain places.
Travelers who are on their way to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont offers very challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, and one often has to drive through arid forest areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your head cold when you encounter steep climbs, narrow road lanes and sharp turns, which are typical of this stretch.
The speed limits are noticeably lower than previous and later road sections, usually 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph), and it is even more important than otherwise to follow these.
Remarkably, mobile coverage is much better here than at many other stretches along the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, just as with its southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, in which apples are added to pastries year-round, while cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. For such popular cakes it is usually well suited with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but powerful pastry, try what, depending on the area you are in, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Career dishes are based on herbs and spices mixed with either meat or vegetables.
A career can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of fluid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in careers. In southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella approach covering a range of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if used without additional identifiers, the term usually means food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago and can offer a variety of simple spicy dishes. The most dominant flavors that the Javanese like best are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stairbells provide support to the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but this can be a safety risk, because the feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is tossed by a horse, but his foot is stuck in the climbing bend, he can be pulled after the horse runs off guard. A number of safety measures can ensure to minimize this risk.
First, most riders use riding boots with heels and a smooth and quite narrow sun.
Some halls, especially English halls, also have a safety mechanism that allows a riser to release from the hall if pulled backwards by a horseman who is about to fall off.
The Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley – the main climbing destination in Chile, known as Yosemite in South America, with many large granite walls and cliffs.
The summits offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from large parts of the world continuously create new routes in the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Cross-country skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where you slide down snowy terrain on skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "skiboms", who plan the entire holiday trip around skiing in a particular place.
The idea behind skiing/running is very old. Hole paintings illustrating skiers are dated back to 5000 BC!
Slalom as a sport goes all the way back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This is also called wilderness skiing, cross-country skiing or mountain skiing.
The activity is related to, but usually does not involve randonee skiing on the high mountains or peak hikes in steep terrain, requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the skiing you are going through as if it were a long walk on foot.
Under good conditions, you will be able to leave greater distances behind than if you walk, but only very rarely it goes as fast as on cross-country skiing in prepared trails without a heavy bag on your back.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but has many independent states. Usually when traveling through several countries, you have to go through visa applications and passport checks several times.
But the Schengen area functions almost as one country in this context.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through multiple passport checks.
If you have a Schengen visa, this works the same way. You do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, thus saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years, as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, and the age limit may be lower in e.g. North America compared to Europe.
Household products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the common people, and the culture surrounding the enterprise is also important for many with other professions.
Traditionally, not all sams have been involved in reindeer herding on a large scale, but lived by fishing, hunting, and the like, and they have mostly used reindeer as migratory animals.
Today many Sami work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in S<0xC3><0xA1>pmi, i.e. Sameland.
Although widely used, especially by others than the Romani people, the word "gypsy" is often seen as noisy due to the association of negative stereotypes and misconceptions of the Romani people.
If travel advice has been created for the country you are going to visit, this can affect your health insurance or cancellation insurance.
It may also be a good idea to check what advice lies outside of authorities other than your own, but remember that their advice is intended for their residents.
For example, U.S. citizens of the Middle East may come up with situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
The councils are only a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
What is presented here is often clear, general and simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious societal consequences, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Heavy winds, hail, extreme rainfall and fire are forms and effects of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloud pumps, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include heavy snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers should also stay informed of the risk of bad weather affecting the area, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
With a search on the Internet for "Hostile environment course" or "conflict management course", you will probably find the address of a local company.
A course normally covers the situations discussed here, in more detail, and usually with practical exercises.
A course usually lasts for 2–5 days and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes gun training.
There are several books and magazines on how to survive in the wilderness, but there are few publications on war zones.
Travelers who plan to carry out sex-corrigible operations abroad must ensure that they carry valid documents for their home trip.
It varies how willing the authorities are to issue passports without specifying gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender.
In addition, it varies how willing authorities abroad are to accept these documents.
Searches in security checks have also become far more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Probably, before the operation, transgender people cannot expect to get through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Outgoing streams are streams of water from waves that have broken towards the beach, and that retreat, often by reefs and the like.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper corridors, and here a rapid flow out towards deeper water can form.
Most people die as a result of fatigue while trying to swim back towards the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, it's not harder to swim back than normal.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught by the power again. Alternatively, depending on what you do, and if someone has caught your eye, it might be a good idea to wait for someone to rescue you.
Reverse culture shock can come faster than culture shock (less wheat bread days), and this can last longer and be more powerful.
Those who have been out and about, and who have had an easy time adapting to the new culture, may have had the extra burden of adapting to their own culture again.
When they return home after living abroad, they have adapted to the new culture and lost some of their previous habits.
When traveling abroad, people were probably patient and welcoming at first, since it takes some time for reluctantly to adapt in a new country.
Everyone may not be as patient and welcoming when the travelers return home, but this is probably as important.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is some of the most exciting in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the stills before the show starts.
Usually you hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The history of the sound and the light is like a history book.
The Sphinx forms a backdrop and stands as the narrator of a long history.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations. They have the most stations, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The largest of the islands is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular and natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on this side of the peninsula merge into the plateau, but reappear later to form a 360 km long mountain range in the form of the Ellsworth Mountains, where the Minnesota Glacier occurs between.
The northern part, the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which has a peak that rises 4892 meters above sea level.
In remote locations where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a good replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have free visibility to the satellite in order to call.
The service is often used in shipping, including recreational vessels, and during expeditions that require external data and voice services.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among school students who have completed a course of study and can take a year off before starting university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, a course abroad in the free year can give you better chances of taking higher education in your home country.
Usually, you will have to pay a tuition fee to enroll in such educational programs.
Finland is a great boat destination. "The Land of the Thousand Seas" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak for a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. the number in the Netherlands is one to forty).
Most regular cruises in the Baltic have a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two whole days, but that you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only land when taking part in excursions arranged on the trip, you do not need a separate visa (starting in 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany, in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be scary for people of all ages and with different backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
There is nothing to be ashamed of. There is not so much dissimilar fear and dislike of other things, as very many people have.
For some, understanding more about how airplanes work, and what happens during a flight, can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or on having no control.
A courier company is well paid to deliver things quickly. Time often means a lot when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, the big companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies this was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, on some routes it could have taken several days of unloading and customs.
The only thing that worked to get them through faster was to send those who checked baggage. The airline's regulations do not allow to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you get in.
Just cough up a bunch of settlers (or preferably get your company to do it for you) if you want to fly first class or business class.
This is not cheap, and as a rule of thumb you can expect to have to pay up to four times more than normal economy class price for business class, and eleven times more for first class.
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for cheap business class or first class tickets on direct routes from A to B by plane.
Airlines know that there is a particular group of airline passengers who are willing to pay very much to be able to travel somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic where there have been many ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova was created with its own government and its own currency, but this is not recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic cooperation has been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million. The city has the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna, is now a modern, developed and busy commercial city center that surrounds a large bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, glass buildings and modern shopping centers have traditional red roof tiles, a 18th-century square and ancient mosques and churches, although the atmosphere of the city is more marked by Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsv<0xC3><0xAD>k overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
On the churchyard you can see interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some tombstones.
It is worth strolling around the captivating village for half an hour.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and fascinating village of Sintra, which became known to foreigners when Lord Byron so brilliantly conveyed how magnificent it was here.
Scotturb bus No. 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, you can visit the Great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (sacred place), where Mary repeatedly revealed herself, stories that are known all over the world.
Remember that you simply visit a mass grave and a place that means infinitely much to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who live today and survived the time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked their lives here, both Jews and others.
The place deserves to be shown dignity, awe and respect. Did not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not destroy the site by drawing or writing on the construction works.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, because according to the law it is the official first language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in connection with public transport and other services.
Regular messages on the subway are said only in Catalan, while unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a number of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Although it is often a misperceived stereotype, the best way to do it in Paris is to behave in the best possible way, as one who is "bien levé" (well-behaved), and then it will be much easier to get around.
A seemingly brittle exterior quickly disappears in the Parisians if you are fundamentally polite.
Plitvice Lakes National Park contains a lot of forests, mainly beech, spruce and conifers, and has a mixture of alpine vegetation and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a particularly wide selection of plant communities due to the spectrum of microclimate, different soils and varying altitude levels.
In the area there is also an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Here you will find rare faunas such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lip, wild cat and tiur, along with many more common species.
Women visiting the convents must wear skirts that cover their knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most of the monasteries lend shawls to women who have not thought of this. But if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
This is also possible to borrow from the collection at the entrance, but the clothes will not be washed after each user, so it is not likely that you will feel comfortable using them. The sizes are suitable for all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, as in similar areas of the Mediterranean, uses a lot of bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) as well as olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli. This is bread with olive oil, tomato and available flavorings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns in addition to the word Sie (De) always start with capital letters, even if it is in the middle of a sentence.
In this way, it is easier to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated because you need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in noun form.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The most important letters to follow are c and g, since the pronunciation varies based on the vowel that follows.
Also be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: Caro means dear, while caro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, this introduction to grammar can teach you a lot about Persian grammar and how to understand sentences better.
If you know a Romance language, of course it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But it's easy for those who know a bit of Spanish, quickly conclude that Portuguese is equal enough that you don't need to study it outside.
Observatory built before modern times is largely obsolete today and remains as a museum or teaching building.
Since light pollution was not a problem at the time, we usually find them in cities or in university areas where they are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Today’s modern research telescopes are often huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 7th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum flowers were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first celebrations of the cherry blossom string were arranged by the emperor, and they were only for him and other members of the aristocracy of the emperor's court.
Plants look best when in a natural environment, so don't fall for the temptation to "just take one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formal garden facility, taking "one copy" is guaranteed to be reason to show you off.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, and it is easy to get around. You will also get almost anything after you arrive.
However, when you live in a tropical climate just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with both heat (continuous) and strong sun (when it is cloudless, which is more rare).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional cemetery of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes all the way to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Waterways in the inland can be nice to base your holiday trip on.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhin Valley, you can take a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also a starting point for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have embraced many of the traditions of the holiday season.
It is a tradition to be awake on Easter night and see the sunrise outdoors.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may as well be a spring and fertility ritual that has roots to pre-Christian times.
More traditional churches often hold a Easter Sunday night on Easter weekend, where the congregation often breaks into the celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally came to the islands, came swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, the mammals were unable to carry out the journey, making the giant turtle the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, several mammals have arrived, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, where the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Then there are good conditions to be able to see the Northern Lights, since the sky is dark more or less all day.
As the population is spread beyond the areas and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to see the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to.
Dresses are standard business outfits, and employees appeal to each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, and emphasis is placed on group effort rather than praise for individual achievements.
Employees often need to get approval from their superiors for any decisions to be made, and they are expected to follow instructions from their superiors without asking questions.
