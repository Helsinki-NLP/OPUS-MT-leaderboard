Inflation in Europe has skyrocketed due to food
The acceleration of inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the constant increase in food prices.
Price growth in November in the 13 countries of the euro area was higher than expected, with annual inflation of 3.1 per cent after 2.6 per cent in October, the Luxembourg statistical office of the Union announced.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, according to Bloomberg.
Unlike the U.S., U.K. and Canadian issuing banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the base interest rate, with the downturn leading to an inflationary spiral, coupled with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment.
The ECB would like to keep its inflation rate below 2%, but close to it.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it has to "defuse" inflation so that it does not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation is a record 15 years old at 3.3 per cent, and in Spain it rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has skyrocketed due to sharply rising food and energy prices.
Term wheat prices rose by 88 percent, and soybean prices also reached their highest since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil in world markets rose by 52 percent this year, and last month it already cost one barrel of black gold almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but will drop to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation in the next 3-4 months will remain at around 3 percent, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to double its interest rates in 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement after a prolonged stagnation at the beginning of December has increased significantly, and so now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Socialists, the Gallup Institute has never measured such low - 13% support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference would be more than two-thirds (71 per cent) of the MEPs’ support, due to the greater determination of opposition voters.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for entry into parliament: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among some voters of the party, supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has also deteriorated with the previous low - never before has the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad, so high - 41 percent, while according to the other 46 percent the situation is quite bad.
Families are now again more pessimistic about the change in their material situation after the spring and summer more promising prospects.
As for next year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, the Gallup Institute’s most polled to date, judged that the prime minister is doing his job more badly than well.
Ferenci Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny is believed or very much believed by 13 percent of respondents, while Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n's supporters share is 38 percent.
Fifty-four percent don’t trust the prime minister, and 27 percent don’t trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be solved without a change of government.
While after last October’s unrest, the government’s and prime minister’s permanence was seen as a desirable 35 percent, this share is currently only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in writing new elections.
For the sake of a referendum, it is characteristic that 60 percent of respondents answered a question about their possible participation, that they would certainly come to the referendum, and another 20 percent said that they would probably come.
For comparison, "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly be attended by only 55 percent and another 15 percent consider their participation to be probable. The success of the referendum would be unquestionable based on current intentions.
The school would say no to 74, 79 to doctor fees and 84 percent to hospital stay fees.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people who are sure to promise their participation, then the introduction of tuition fees, doctor fees and hospital fees would reject 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth irritated Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budapest business triangle maintained last year’s, on average, 16% price level growth, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
Newspaper article Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g
The usual Christmas consumption basket of the newspaper Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g in the Buda-Oerse business triangle increased by an average of 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets there was an increase in the price of not more than a thousand forints.
As prices in supermarkets "flighted" as early as December, the percentage did not show as drastic an increase due to the previous high base.
However, it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that what they could have bought last year at a price below nine thousand forints will not be available for ten thousand.
The Daily Economy’s consumer basket in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but they greatly irritated the cruel breasts, nuts and also poppy.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product under 200 forints.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola in a return bottle was below 200 forints, so even with a backup, the product cost only 257 forints.
However, this year, according to the consumer basket of the newspaper Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g Auchan appeared as the most expensive, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices in the consumer basket of the newspaper Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g rose by 15 percent compared to prices last year on Christmas Cora, while Tesco and Auchan rose by about 18 percent.
When comparing last year’s highest and this year’s lowest consumption basket values, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest was 21 percent.
In the Forints there was an increase of an average of 1,480.
The average price increase last year came to 1,206 forints, with prices last year on Christmas being affected by VAT increases.
It was this process that brought the trade to a standstill, and the retailers were clearly unable to decide how large the price range would be for each product, as they could not predict the impact of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader schedules the rate of circulation of a given product poorly, a significant profit may be lost due to the price range adjusted to the intensity of the circulation.)
Due to VAT, the rise in the price of the consumer basket of Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g newspaper last year was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest one made a price difference of 844 forints everywhere.
This year there was no extreme difference, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest one raised 1,284 forints.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was revealed, in less than 20 months, the goods undercut daily consumption in hypermarkets by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, is not absolutely confirmed by the Central Statistical Office: it measured price increases of more than 30 percent in the 12 months of several staple foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the consumer basket of the Daily Economy, this seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, already quite expensive in the last year, showed a price growth of barely more than 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Meal suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they have managed to enforce drastic price increases in international chains as well.
Hypermarkets in the commercial golden triangle do not complain, they still report a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything quantum, durable foods take after salaries.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets formed long queues at the cash registers, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, the turnover in rural areas is lower, more international chains are complaining to research companies that sales are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places it saves on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection were registered in hospitals, mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff to stop the infection do not help, says the mayor of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, it also saves on disinfectants.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of St. John’s Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been found in a man who arrived at the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after that he had to return with an MRSA infection and due to the bacteria found in his body, one important operation could not be carried out.
As of 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1>, Mayor of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacilin-resistant golden staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by a third of people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be well treated.
However, if antibiotics are administered excessively or inappropriately, it will develop from a bacterium that responds well to antibiotics, a bacterium that is highly resistant to antibiotics and that spreads rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of temporary or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with weakened body, low body weight or in patients in years can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the chief doctor of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections belong to daily practice in hospitals.
"Infection must not be confused with an epidemic, MRSA is not just there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the disease-causing agent is not investigated."
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the staff treats them in rubber gloves and masks, and we have antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined if MRSA is present in their body, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions in domestic hospitals are not favorable for preventing the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs symptomatically in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor patients admitted and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these examinations also plays a role in this.
Most cases are thus revealed if a patient suffers from a noticeable MRSA infection, said the primary epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Efforts need to be made to target antibiotic therapy, or microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but even hospitals do not comply in all cases.
The collection of microbiological samples is even rarer in the primary and outpatient treatment of patients, Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
It saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most commonly spread among patients through medical personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in washing hands and wearing gloves and masks, but there are also serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and by touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients in the conditions of home hospitals.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
As Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1> noted, unfortunately, we can also find that in hospitals, which are in an unfavorable material situation, there are savings on disinfectants, there are few nurses and there are a lot of patients, thus increasing the chances of infection.
According to Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1>, where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are demonstrably less or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is fought against everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written a program to prevent MRSA, or reduce its occurrence.
The program appears to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England show a decreasing trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) places prevention of multi-resistent pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these pathogens among its priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion in the case of the police captain of the XXII. district, who caused the fatal accident, is finished.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who has since resigned from his post, was driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, the spokesman of the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital Attila Morvai informed on Friday of this case after the investigation was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which already stated that the former police captain did not drink alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The then director of the police department of the XXII district collided on Tuesday in Lajose Kossuth Street in the XXII district with his own personal car while turning off a fifty-five-year-old man who entered before him as he crossed the road outside the marked crossing.
(The last mentioned fact that the pedestrian passed outside the zebra, by the way, according to the rules of road traffic is not a relief, the detouring car must still give preference.)
After being transported to the hospital, the walker died.
Due to these events, the district police director resigned and asked for a transfer to the service, according to police reports, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been collaborating with prosecutors conducting the investigation from the beginning.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million loan frameworks to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed on Friday in Budapest by Minister of Finance J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for Hungary’s budget financing of transport and environmental projects supported by the Cohesion Fund, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, now signed with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan agreement is also used for the budgetary financing of projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract, which will be used primarily for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk of the 4th subway route.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has negotiated with the EU the details of the financing of the metro, it will return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nose Verese, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary since 1990, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year standby period and without a commitment commission shall be at the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astounding - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the EU’s still cheapest, but rapidly rising market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought after East European destination for real estate purchases is undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
The mountains are mostly in the area of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vito<0xC5><0xA1>a, on the sea coast Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties in the area of Kavarna and Bal<0xC4><0x8D>ik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later investors will also be interested in the central part of the country - for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more interested people are also shopping in the vicinity of the very cheap city of Ruse.
Also, the capital city of Sofia is a promise of attractive options, business and office premises promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, becoming a sought-after travel destination alongside the summer and winter seasons in the next two seasons.
Foreseeable investors are already buying in bulk, for example around Bansk<0xC3><0xA1> Bystrica.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyle.
Most of the customers come from England, but buyers also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors present, while there are traditionally many Russian customers in the Black Sea and in the skiing paradises.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgiy Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Squatting people buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or ruined old houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication options, it is important for them the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor.
The second category is chat buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of rising value in the medium- or long-term.
The real estate prices in the capital are constant, as the demand is increasing.
While Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, they have risen by 21 per cent annually over the past five years.
The rise in property prices significantly outpaces wage growth.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to the information of the Minister of Environment and Water Management G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, the meeting of experts will end on Tuesday and after the official opening on Wednesday, the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue with the negotiations of the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are negotiating the Bali Travel Map, which addresses efforts following the Kyoto emission reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there is a turbulent debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not want to negotiate precise figures now, although it is in favour of an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to the state in 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries, in addition to reducing emissions, will also undertake to provide both material and technological assistance to the countries that are referred to it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member management board, probably under the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in the magazine Piac és Profit.
6 percent of Hungarians
The Minister of Environment and Water on behalf of Hungary, G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leadership role in its efforts to protect the global climate and help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 from the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the adoption of the "after 2012 agreement", and is ready to commit to a reduction of up to 30 per cent in the event that their potential is increased by other developed countries and regions of the world, respectively.
Gabor Fodor pointed out that the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set themselves a target of a reduction of 5.2 per cent, with the then 15 EU Member States committing to 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will meet. - recalls in a press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
In Bali, this is a lot, because within two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force would be postponed with certainty until 2012. In such a case, the commitments to reduce established by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately result in its new system of reduction of emissions.
This would lead to a delay in emissions reductions and an inevitable increase in the Earth’s average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruitment on YouTube
British military forces are posting on a video-sharing server footage of events in Iraq and Afghanistan that they are popularizing themselves with.
At first, YouTube was favored by the British Air Force (RAF): special forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Command in the Kandahar area and then sent to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is unavoidable.
In this form, 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have been made available on the Internet and more than 75,000 people have already viewed their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 as a "defense headquarter" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
According to the Ministry of Defense, the air forces have released the videos according to their original intention for recruitment, and they are also good to familiarize the general public with the real purpose of the army's presence abroad.
"Propagation published in this form against traditional television recruitment ads costs almost nothing," said defence expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it necessarily also carries a certain political message, as it confirms in a special form the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government."
The Americans made a game.
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also received on the server, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in some hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers talk about losses at the most, but they will not get killed.
By the way, many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during the sharp deployment, have already been accessed on the Internet, but the British army has only now come to them.
The Americans perform the recruitment a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can through a more or less faithful simulation get right into the skin of the soldiers.
At the ministries will be Christmas with a tombola and pagans
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Lamperth<0xC3><0xB3>v<0xC3><0xA1> is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will organize a final working meeting for her colleagues, where pagans and coffee will say goodbye to 2007.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, elsewhere will enchant officials with a Christmas atmosphere with a toast and a toast.
A party, a Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - that's how the powerful have fun.
Government agencies are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it does not expect its employees to attend it.
On Christmas Orphans, the children of fallen soldiers receive gifts, during the Mission Christmas guests of family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but they also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort dedicates 25 million to the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will throw themselves out of the bucket compared to the other agencies.
The GKM party is held in the center of Jöv<0xC5><0x91> H<0xC3><0xA1>za, behind a total of 4,320,000 forints and about three hundred and fifty guests are expected from the six hundred employees of the ministry.
At its celebration, the resort will adhere to Christmas traditions, but there will also be various performances and also a raffle.
Christmas NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Council of Justice (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
The rental of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
It seems that one department of the NFÜ is invited to the next Christmas celebration: the company that organizes the tenders, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
For this purpose they rented the building of the V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z Theatre.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information, as we were unable to reach the person concerned.
No need for a suit
The OIT building was not only hosted by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which instead of Christmas hosted the St. Lucia Ball on 7 December.
However, the OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The party began with the minister of health, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball, there were no obligatory evening dresses or suits at all.
The Puritan party is being prepared by health, work and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Lamperth does not even officially invite employees to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
There are a hundred and eighty guests who, according to the press department, will only get coffee and pagans, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Local Government Minister Gordon Bajnai and his collaborators will simply have a drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting, at which 436 employees are expected, in its own large hall.
For the Christmas party, it dedicates 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and a toast.
Since being Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be lacking, the officiality is enhanced not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The agriculture resort holds a New Year's reception on January 20, Ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place in Vajdahunyadv<0xC3><0xA1>r Castle in the City Halls and according to the Ministry's announcement, 1,000 forints per person are allocated for 100 guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief ministerial reception and end with a small reception.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold Christmas parties at all, the relevant press departments told the [origo] portal.
The price of the Christmas celebrations of the environmental resort in the press department could not be announced.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Art Museum.
He's heading for a giant strike.
On Friday, the League of Trade Unions and the National Union of Workers’ Councils (MOSZ) will form their strike committee to coordinate Monday’s unlimited strike.
A protest public meeting is taking place on Saturday, and on Monday - the day of the final vote on the health insurance law - work will be stopped.
The event will surely cause a serious disruption of transport, as railway transport will almost completely stop and within 13 hours employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Association will share with the National Union of Workers’ Councils the details of the jointly organised Monday strike.
The strike commission LIGA - MOSZ will also be formed, which will coordinate Monday's event.
A public protest rally is taking place on Saturday, and from Monday, unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for ending the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament fails to pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the legislation is voted on, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to the agenda of the Parliament's meeting on Monday, it is also possible that the law on health insurance will be voted on only in the late evening, or at night.
Due to the start of the strike on Monday, it is possible to expect serious traffic disruptions: work on the railway will be stopped indefinitely, part of Budapest's public transport and more than half of the Volan companies can stop in the morning.
At the same time, half of the lane will be closed in many parts of the country.
Numerous trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the call for strikes, the list of which is constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some organizations have announced a strike indefinitely, others have announced a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV) and the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not agree on sufficient services, while more and more people travel on the railway at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to the current announcements, the strike will be held at BKV from the beginning of operation until 1 pm, from 7 am to 9 am at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organized by the Trade Unions of Workers in the Energy Industry LIGA, to the 2-, respectively 2-8-hour stoppage of work by the Trade Union of Teachers and Democrats.
The Union of Hungarian Physicians will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), part of the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by League associations is for the government to withdraw the health insurance reform proposal and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions, valid from next year, be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, the possibility of early retirement for the sectors concerned to be included in the scheme before 2010 should be ensured.
The fourth reason for the event is that the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), which falls under the League trade union association, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding railway branches, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases Country Risk
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, immediately increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole region in several respects.
The company's "risk warning" states: "In the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "by exacerbating the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma populations of Hungary, violent ethnic clashes can occur in a short period of time."
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to provoke such an event - adds the research institute.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the greatest negligences of Hungarian political leaders: "public discussion on the Roma issue was left by representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could have built a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian contradiction."
This deepens the problem, impedes normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
Moreover, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media "has greatly distorted the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the belief in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which has been gaining increasing publicity and vehemence since the fall of 2006, is that several organizations have been created in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which themselves call themselves "national self-defense".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civic associations, while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the event of natural disasters, attacking the homeland, disturbing the order), in addition to pointing out the inability of the state to police, the army or
It further notes: all this is done in a way that seeks to wrap the various political efforts built on society’s resistance to politics and the parties in civilian clothes.
Thus, in the case of these groups, the emphasis on civility and the form of the association serves not only to avoid the legal loopholes of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk-increasing factor in terms of neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been pointed out in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, and the ultra-nationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries want to apologize for their own anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this can affect the political stability of the region," he adds.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so the political risks to the region as a whole have increased.
For example, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard stands mass Romani riots, which erupted in one of the Sofia neighborhoods (Krasna Poljana).
It was used by BNU to establish a guard with the aim of the organization being "national self-defense".
In the past 17 years, according to her, there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, recalls the Institute of Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a turbulent debate among the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they will create their own guard in the wake of resistance.
Since the current activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma will react to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own defence, we can read in the warning on the risks developed by the Institute of Political Capital.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, research director of the Political Capital Institute, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis every year and if they find something that could affect the change in risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are precisely stipulated by law and it has already become common practice to move working days around the holidays, which is expected to happen less often in the next year.
In the European Union and in America, holidays are not unified.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and days of rest.
The days of work rest are usually associated with church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a work holiday - for the New Year already so that people can rest after New Year.
During the year we have a total of eleven free holidays.
The national holiday is March 15th to celebrate the Revolution of 1848 and October 23rd, the commemorative day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1st the work, on November 1st and 2nd we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, there are two-day holidays of Easter, Summer and Christmas.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on weekends according to the calendar, it has become a practice to move the working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price for the extended weekend is that the previous Saturdays we stay in the workplace and in the school.
The day which immediately precedes or follows the holiday is worked out by the Minister of Labour in a special decree for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and workers employed by them, to public servants and to persons in the public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or with regard to their destination, even on days of working rest.
This year, the work order will change only around the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because according to the experience so far, most people "work" the days between Christmas and New Year in advance or thus take advantage of the saved holiday.
Next year, a few of our holidays fall into the middle, respectively, at the end of the week, so there will be less workday shifts than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around the holiday so that the workers can then stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday 26th of April will be a working day, so that Friday 2nd of May can be a day of rest.
Another move is related to the holiday of October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, work will be done instead of Friday, October 24th.
At the end of the year, however, next year will be able to take place completely in the name of holidays, because from December 24 they will have a non-stop holiday almost everywhere, even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
6 scary little things you can do to piss off your colleagues
The e-mails we forget to send, the voice messages we never receive, the innocent lies we almost never notice: all of this "boosts" everyday life in the workplace.
The question is whether you will get used to these little inconveniences, or put on gloves and vague situations that can make others angry, you will intentionally avoid them.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague tells you.
That's why you missed the meeting?
In the best case, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or he will call the marketing department and say that he forgot to forward the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, the matter is solved by an apology.
Before there is an embarrassing apology, it is good to think about what you could do to prepare colleagues for unpleasant moments, and consciously try to prevent it.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more inconvenient than stretching for some type of writing, office supplies, or for your phone, and they’re not there.
You remember you put a stapler on your desk last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you find your pen on the desk of one of your colleagues that you thought was lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will be rightly angry at you for bothering them in things.
Don’t take envelopes or sticky papers out of the office, as it can be uncomfortable when they come out prematurely, and you’ll need them right away.
Rumors about the private lives of colleagues?
There is no good way to stop spreading gossip.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not tell everyone your news (suggestions) about the private life of colleagues!
When one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report your absence with a strong headache because you are not well, or you think that you would rather rest today, think that your work, urgent tasks, and work with which they have a certain deadline will have to be done for you by someone else.
Be mindful of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you are not going to work the next day, or that something may happen that you will have to stay home for, report it so that your colleagues and leaders are not confronted with your absence until the next day.
Screaming, groaning, calling
Have you been immersed in a job where you're being ripped off by your co-worker's groaning?
Unintentionally, did you witness a telephone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not disturb your co-workers by groaning, chanting, talking loudly (over their heads), or by groaning, by constant swearing, by loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be disruptive even when they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for their mistakes?
If something is not on time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame the other for your forgetfulness!
Do not appeal to the possible chaos prevailing in the office and noisy colleagues!
Recognize if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and fix the damage!
Ask how you could put things in order, correct the negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Pants and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, but not suitable for the office!
Do not wear casual clothing, even if your profession allows it!
Don't be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in regular dresses - and if your profession requires it, nicely and elegantly!
When a person wants to please, he ceases to be interesting
Ride in the usual morning congestion.
From the radio a strange melody is heard: the sound of the violin, to which electronic effects are connected.
I'm adding volume.
The music changes the tempo and to previous tonal colors is added bass, then as a real jewel joins the women's choir.
On mr2 is a song by Zagar called Wings of Love.
For a long time, home music life did not spoil us with quality electronic pop.
But suddenly the constipation looks quite different, because you're just listening to Zagaru's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions coming from the domestic digital underground, the overall picture is slowly changing, and although it is again in fashion garage rock with its smashing into the guitar, the domestic electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started in Pétikostel<0xC3><0xAD> and he also played in Yonderboi's band until he finally - perhaps because two dudes do not fit into one line - went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film Ference Töröka "Szezon").
His band, which began in smaller clubs, met a wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first album of 2002 among the 50 most important home albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as the only home entity to determine developments that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "on course", although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this sticker.
The band reacted as they belonged: they made a new, better album.
The now-released album Cannot Walk Fly instead can open up new paths for them, though the name itself tries to create a connection with the initial flights in the Five Seas.
This is because it is a verse from the composition of the old band Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
The reference to the ethereal, flying would be in place, but besides the ethereal touch of this music has now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time - the louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, presented himself at the premiere of the album at Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris Park.
The album also produced a real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, playing popular music lately from morning to evening, we began to adorn the lavish melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six home singers ("Underground Divas").
So all is well (?).
The portal hvg.hu confessed Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: In the context of this new hit, the question arises, how much of what you play remains marginal music?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The definition of marginal music means nothing to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they say nothing, and it can only be created because of sales, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can come from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is adopted also works, regardless of language and state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign music, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in their twenties, but also older people.
Many more are watching the transformations of light music taking place around them, because they also consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where, and how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived rather in concerts, where the mutual influence already works, but this is hidden only in the imperceptible transformations of the moment.
Yet I have noticed that if one wants to please the audience, from that moment on he ceases to be interesting.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He's working solo, and he's built his career away from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don’t actually go his way, regardless of the fact that sometimes they try to explain our music.
We’re more of a team of players who rely on each other’s musical presence and let it evolve.
At first, of course, we couldn’t help but compare our work to Yonderboie’s, because a few of us separated from his band and set off on a different path.
hvg.hu: In the chart of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, Wings of Love reached number one.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, did you consciously open yourself to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We weren’t planning on writing a hit to sell the record.
There's more to this song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, with which we tried to unleash the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose those six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then the idea came to compose this choir from solo pieces of the home music scene with a good voice.
So we put together this six-member choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosis [Neo], Juci Nemeth - which we then renamed Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that exactly what you meant by the song, or did the girls remake something about it?
B.Zs.: The song had been in the instrumental version for a long time, then when the material on the record came together, we thought that something else would be needed for this song.
The track of the chords led to the addition of a singing part.
That day and night I sang a melody to him that the girls later learned.
It all came out almost for the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it came to life, but of course, Diva was needed to do that.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that vigorously.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert it seemed that the girls were in the background.
They don’t have a solo (except for Judy Jay), they don’t have a role of their own, they sing completely together, and they’re not louder than music, so the music just doesn’t accompany their singing.
They were also in the back of the stage.
On purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
On the contrary, the fact that we did not want to divide solo roles is intentional.
Even the song is about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where who is from, where it belongs, and just letting those wings, the wings of love, lift up.
I wish that this euphoric state, which we felt when the song was born, would be felt by others.
Hvg.hu: Which was the most worked with?
B.Zs.: When composing music, not even with one, heavier pieces occurred when mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play a concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he didn't want to work groove, then everything slowly found its place as in some puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is always changing with the concert and the fact that I have already "released" the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous broker risked billions from a minority
A treacherous defrauder.
This is how the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Commercial Bank, refers to its illustrious employee, Jerome Kerviel.
It was almost five billion euros because of him.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to cope with his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
In contrast to all the big banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in good time.
"He's mentally weaker," said his superiors, who sent the police to him.
But according to Kerviel’s statement from French media outlets, for example, Le Monde, he was a man who had a profit of 1.6 billion euros from his trades at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros from the US crisis.
The opportunity was felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to surface that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had repayment problems in the past, will have problems.
But this crisis should not have had an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
At the end of the year, its profit rose to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion.
"When I made my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he hadn't left anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed to falsifying the records so as not to be found.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though he became interested in his trades on the Eurex exchange.
Risk was Profit
Was he afraid he'd come up with it?
I don't think so.
“I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.”
Where did he take the will to take so much risk?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as the others.
“In my first interview in 2005, I knew they were charging me.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the start came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares, Allianz made a profit, because in the bombing of London, it was betting on the decline of this title of half a billion euros.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew it all, or rather, they knew it.
"As long as I was making money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion dollars in a single day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to wipe it out.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it lost five billion euros due to it.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
“I’ve only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who doesn’t have a vacation is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look at his records,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has a chance to win 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around CZK 100 billion from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will run next year with an amount of CZK 90.8 billion.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Firms should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful in drawing money from EU funds in the newly adopted countries.
Former Nicaraguan President Sentenced to 20 Years in Court
A Nicaraguan appeals court on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud amounting to $100 million (nearly CZK 1.8 billion).
However, he was later released from prison and lived in a domestic prison on his khacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of the Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison is unclear at the moment, according to the AP.
According to the president of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to prison officials to let the German serve his sentence at home or travel to prison.
Four years ago, a court proved to the German that he regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that the German had set up to fund his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved the budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
Last year, it passed with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote on distrust of the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies has passed the law, which has traditionally been overlooked, despite being the most influential.
It's a paradox.
Every government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the power rivalry of the government with the opposition.
This is more media-friendly, which is why the media pays a lot more attention to it.
Guessing politicians is much more interesting to the public than stringent numbers.
The state budgets in the past social democratic governments suffered from three ailments that the one for 2008 is not able to solve at once:
The first of these is the high share of mandatory, so-called mandated expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year before the elections by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is deficit management as a result of the disease of the first.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
The biggest problem is the budget deficit of cities and towns.
Many mayors, in addition to money from taxes, fees, and loans from banks, obtained additional resources for investment, often headlessly issued bonds, with which they disproportionately indebted their city halls.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other distribution networks, which they have received from the state in privatization.
They no longer have that resource.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as has the rest of the world, and the Czechoslovak SSR is constantly boasting.
It was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state was increasingly indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much wiser than our republic.
It is a great shame, especially for past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, the least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have just in recent years completely unnecessarily swelled to gigantic dimensions.
Even though some of the senseless populist spending approved before the elections this year has been abolished, unless the retirement and pension reform limits are pushed in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and whoever governs it will be mere officialization.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing the majority of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the expulsion of normal expenditures by mandated expenditures.
The planned deficit of $70 billion for 2008 would be utterly futile if past governments failed to do what they could in the last decade.
If we don’t really want the ruling politicians to become mere officials, then we have to be patient and give in to this not-too-strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get ready for tax and other reforms.
Only these will make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
In this way, more than one hundred billion dollars will be brought to the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks auction the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to auction, and another twenty-four will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of individual states have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step is intended to address the biggest problems facing the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent," Baumohl said in a statement.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in unpaid loans, particularly in the United States.
Analysts are expecting another billion dollars in losses.
“Central banks need to be really worried about what might come next when they decide to do this,” said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about lending money to each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as the next interest rate drop," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that a move by central banks will help to inflame the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the collapse of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: The debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is most likely to harm developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now surfaced at the final United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, Not the Green Planet, he said that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which consists of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also a fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a firework of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President emphasized that its theme is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book also appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my opinions".
Now, therefore, interested parties can read his undistorted attitudes.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, in his opinion he has enough prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional dissertations, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
He pointed to the main conclusions of the book as the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is not the same opinion of all scientists on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too great and serious, and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary and unnecessary.
Moreover, as a person with experience of totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction of freedom.
Asked by those present, he repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver was unable to replace 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to exchange an old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day for people to ask for an exchange, and the authorities are still able to issue them a new card by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the road without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the card has not been exchanged mainly by those who no longer want to drive.
While the municipality reports a sharp decline in interest in driver’s license exchanges, the authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed with requests and interest in the exchange of licenses has increased this week.
The Magistrate handles about 2000 clients per day.
They wait for about half an hour in the queues.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver’s license.
The issuance of a new card takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for publication within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who do not have to change their license by the end of the year and leave the road without a valid driver’s license will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
A police officer may also deal with the offence by appointment.
In the case of an administrative violation, the fine shall amount to 2500 CZK.
According to previous information, he could have received a fine from the city hall even a person who is not going anywhere.
He was also said to have paid 30,000 kroner.
The ministry had earlier called on the authorities to be mild and impose a maximum fine of CZK 1,000.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karl Hanzelka, but tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
According to him, a driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not a valid ID card that every person must have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver’s license.
You just need to take it or send it by registered mail to the relevant local authority.
By the end of the year, the certificates issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
However, motorists must also gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
Court Cuts Penalties for Detectives Associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of criminal association with the gang of David Berdych, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
The Prague Supreme Court, which reduced their sentences by one year and the other by two years, gave final effect to the decision.
It originally threatened the detectives of the Prague Anti-Organized Crime Committee for 14 and 12 years.
Today’s decision can no longer be appealed, only appeals to the Supreme Court are possible.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but is awaiting a first-instance verdict.
In other cases, however, he has already been sentenced to a total of more than 16 years.
He can't get more.
The district court in January, in particular, found 19 people guilty of participating in the robbery, the Supreme Court today decided to appeal 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have denied the prosecution since the beginning of the investigation that it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, according to an agreement with Berdych, police members gave criminals information from police sources, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave up 30 percent for Opava and Kona<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment is a criminal activity of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious harm to health, but also abuse of public authority and illegal armaments.
During the home inspections, the police discovered illegally held pistols, bullets with a steel core, a laser pointer or a machine gun.
The gang is said to have robbed tens of millions of dollars.
In addition to nearly twenty men in the process, the courts have already duly convicted Berdych and many other people of other robberies.
Other men from around Berdych are still testifying in a different trial, some cases have not yet arrived in court.
The main charges have so far been avoided by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC3><0xB3>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who remain in Irish custody, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Children's Swap Account: $12 Million
For the mistake of children in the maternity hospital, the lawyer of the damaged families Igor Veleba wants to compensate 12 million crowns after the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, plus legal costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the father two million and for the child one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, the legal representative of the hospital, therefore disagrees with Veleba’s proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very, very high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's meeting.
"But in order to be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has had to draw up.
Let's see if it has any declarative value at all.
But we remain of the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for all," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
According to him, the amount should range from CZK 100,000 to CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jablonov wanted one million crowns for each month when they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb served as the basis for negotiations on compensation expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
According to experts from the field of psychology and psychiatry, parents of children suffered psychological damage and stress in different degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, even though they faced remorse that they did not prevent the confusion of newborns.
Women, in turn, are less able to cope with the actuality of the trauma experienced and with what is happening right now, summed up the content of Veleba.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the obstetrics in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k<0xC3><0xB3>w to P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE>ov and Jaroslav Trojanov to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
Hejtman Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystro<0xC5><0xA1> gave each of the families at the end of October 100,000 CZK in compensation for the expenses incurred by them by the error of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, which the region establishes.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In case of errors, they must contact the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for help from the founder.
The courts have so far granted people relatively low compensation, the sums were calculated according to the tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup has lost the Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the brand of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the Ostrava regional court, the name was used for the first time by the Wallachian king, but the project was built by a team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who worked with the actor.
The soup did not take part in the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client appeals.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolka Polivka," Polivka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Wallachia will all equip themselves with actors and comedians.
Harabish is of the same opinion.
“There is almost a decade of work behind us.
Hunting for money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project was a success and they could have something to do with it.
They want to parasitize on our work," he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the Welsh king used Polivka for the first time in his television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
But it was not related to the intention to build a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From the original recessionary action, trade and lucrative business activity emerged, to which then Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> continued the establishment of the company of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997 Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to include his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the bare idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka published in the management for his business intention.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polivka's project of the Kingdom of Wallachia certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who devoted themselves intensely to it.
The cooperation of the disenfranchised parties continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to accumulate, which culminated in the demise of "King Boles<0xC5><0x82>aw I elected to the throne".
Singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> assumed the leading role in the kingdom as the queen mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearly, Harabish's planned beating of the throne and half of the princess could bring to the dispute.
A new king should come out of it.
He did not want to reveal the details and the date.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like a ride of kings in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Polivka can safely register," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Disappearing Prejudices
In fact, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were nothing too much, the quality of gearing, steering and also production could be labeled leaks as below-average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is much better.
And a van called SW goes a little further and I have no choice but to think about it.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about the headroom in the rear seats, for example.
This is the end of the complaint, because the body of the van means that they will not suffer even two-metre long in this direction.
Flying around the world
I'm going through the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a fairly successful design, where the only highlight I have is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more designer invention, when the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
Also the lateral conduction has improved significantly against the model 206.
As for the space, here too you can feel the increase in the dimensions of the body.
In the van, the already mentioned lack of space above the head disappears.
Luggage to suitcase
The main thing on this car is its trunk.
I have to evaluate it as very accessible (even thanks to the tilting back window) and as decently foldable.
The deaf spots are equipped with restraint rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not interfere, it can be stretched, while maintaining even heavier objects.
But let's hang out together over the hug.
This is, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic arrangement, which is rather an average value against competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the mladoboleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is behind by a lot of noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I had to highlight the positives, then I still have to mention a completely straight floor after folding the second row of backrests or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre four-cylinder ignition engine with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old who drives a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has little consumption and above all it stretches.
If I compare it to a pest, which sometimes seems like a stuffed cloth in the exhaust, then I can only be excited about it.
The price list suggests
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must keep in mind that we have tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of a car with a ignition 1400 for 329,900 CZK will still be missed.
Our unit costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then fit the equipment for an additional 80,000 CZK.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper start, electric control of the rear windows...
The car costs 531,900 CZK everywhere.
It's a lot, but count on the additional equipment at Fabia and you'll get a very similar number.
There is no choice but to choose a brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
In British schools, there is an increase in children from Eastern European countries, which raises concerns among local residents about the further development of local education.
So far, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools have even recorded cases where disputes between immigrants and children of indigenous peoples grow into violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children in British schools is well illustrated by the case in North Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Disputes, bullying, and quarrels among students have also moved into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham the police arrested a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old pupil with an iron rod.
The culprit is preventing the boy from insulting her with racist accusations.
Police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly paid homage to the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he leaned on us with apples and pears, and then revealed his ass," the mother of Slovak students told The Times.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the local residents even called disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for a fight for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in the UK who came here to work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea you will find it in a full and even richer list.
Only on one island but you will find much more and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a storehouse and a transfer point for the treasures that the Spaniards plundered in America and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially for prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were mr.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses grew, and cars drove along wide boulevards that were among the iconic symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a manor in San Francisco de Paula, a short distance from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of Havana’s Bodeguita.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you can have a cocktail as you wish.
And those iconic cars from the 1950s are still driving through Havana, because the once-imported sticks and fiats in that salty, humid air have long since rotted.
Even though Havana, especially its oldest part, is very insane, there are not so many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there.
Other places are also turning into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much needed money, its development has a green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another delicacy, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by train drivers.
The bulk of the vast plantations was transported to the sugar mills along the narrow tracks of the steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renovated for many decades, so there are working machines, the peers of which are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not mind.
And so about Varadero, or about Havana, there is not much to write about.
Perhaps just to remind that in the already mentioned Hemingway estate there is a museum and who likes this writer, should not miss a visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the valley of Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone substrate.
The moths, limestone mounds and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and the fertile soil has taken hold in their cavities, thanks to which the windy rocks are covered with dense growth.
The valley is the place where perhaps the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet its final form if you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also be interesting to see how Major Zeman's Chilean play was filmed there.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Glory and wealth were brought to him by the slave trade and the sugar trade.
Wealth was transformed into the beauty and beauty of a small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road connecting that region with the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him to stay away.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing rushed, everyone was glad to have a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is also worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n, or the valley of the Sugar Loafs.
In the evening it is necessary to go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which comes to life after dark and the music in it is silent in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely this opinion is already influenced by the road itself.
The two roads that lead there from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo Bay have to overcome the high mountains and pass through nature, which human activity has hardly noticed.
The eastern island of Cuba has been inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site thanks to its unspoilt nature.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus Cross (in fact it was created about a hundred years after Columbus’s voyage) and from the hill where stands the former castle and today’s hotel El Castillo, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, about the Sierra Maestra, about the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, about the shrine of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about santeria, about the African religions that profess the descendants of many former slaves, about this it would be possible to talk to all
But, as they say, it's better to see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan are Passive, U.S. Says
Few troops and a lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a specific plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to growing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are also discussing other plans and Allied coordination.
While the United States called on NATO troops to be more active through Defense Secretary Robert Gates this week, the United Kingdom sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and intensifying development assistance.
“Development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military strength can only be one part of the solution.
Another is to allow the people to start further economic and security development on their own," British Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is the highest in the last five years, according to the U.S. military.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, in the southern province of Helmand even by 60 per cent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, the Allies have reached the limit in the organization and the equipment of the units.
In particular, they are requesting additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
"We're going to have to seriously think about the specific goals for the coming time and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar vein today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there have also been disputes among the participating countries over whether all the allies are carrying out their maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have quite a number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the fighting demands on them are not as high as on us in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The British newspaper Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan fighters uncovered: Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in the footage, supplemented by footage of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into counter-attack and printed a picture of the British squad during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government Debt Rises to a Billion in 2009
For every Czech there is a national debt of more than 84,000 CZK.
Total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has decreased by CZK 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its data on the state debt at the beginning of October.
For each Czech there is a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
For the whole of last year, the state owed more than CZK 111 billion.
"For now, it seems that due to the lower deficit for next year, we could exceed the limit of a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Vladimir Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, said: “We could get over a trillion dollars in 2009.
When exactly will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Debts have grown
The government debt is the debt of the central government and arises mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The public debt is financed by treasury notes, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
So far this year, the state’s internal debt has risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The country’s foreign debt has so far grown by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion this year.
The so-called negotiable government debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the government debt increased to 6.5 years.
“The total debt grew by 13 percent in the first to third quarter, which is actually a lot about how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
“It’s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to trade with when there is a pension reform,” Pikor said.
Better than expected.
The government’s 2007 financing and debt management strategy shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly made up of the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion crowns.
It is also a planned maximum resource for the Czech Consolidation Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, financing of government bonds of CZK 43 billion and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear in court today in Khartoum for giving her name to a teddy bear
A British teacher convicted in Sudan of insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday night and deported, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting six to seven-year-old students give the teddy bear the name Mohamed despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is prohibited.
She was punished with whip wounds.
The four-and-a-half-year-old British teacher, who works at Unity High School in Sudan's Khartoum, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils in the school.
Our story actually begins as early as September, when the teacher in question asks her six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
"There are eight names that come out of the mouths of children, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," said school principal Robert Boulos.
After a class vote, 20 of the 23 children eventually choose Mohamed as the most popular name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very common baptismal name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photo of the bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself had no label with this name, but the problem is in the very depiction of a prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One fellow Muslim Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, stated that she knew her well and would never do anything that might be offensive to any religious belief: "I'm just sorry that she asked children to vote for just a name," she said.
This view is shared by many pupils who describe it as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that "they never talk about religion in class".
Recall that the surname Mohammed is also the second most commonly given surname in the United Kingdom, written in English in fourteen different ways.
This baptismal name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way of worshiping the Prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Is it possible to give them a toy?
Of course, it's a matter of interpretation.
At the last round of negotiations on Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Failed in the end.
Serbian and Kosovar Albanians ended the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome differing views on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the two sides were unable to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is "at stake" and called on Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to peace and to be ready for dialogue even after negotiations have ended.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he added, adding that "it is clear that the situation is tense."
Negotiations end on December 10
The Troika negotiators, consisting of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the Albanian-speaking population resides, could be seen in a brighter light by Dec. 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are due to hand over their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN commissioned the Troika to renegotiate in August this year.
Americans and Europeans expect the talks to end on Dec. 10.
The Russians, who have previously blocked Kosovo’s independence in the UN Security Council, are insisting that negotiations continue even after this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Charchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of international community governance, the West considers Kosovo’s independence under EU supervision the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," Kosovo's President Fatmir Sejdiu said at a hotel in Baden, where "last chance negotiations" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Tha<0xC3><0xA7>i, the former rebel commander of the Kosovo Albanians and the future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations".
"Dominant effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadi<0xC4><0x87>, on the other hand, believes that a compromise is still being considered and has warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the province's unilaterally declared independence.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars for independence in the 1990s.
"But for Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has veto power.
"The Kosovo parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution originating from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Ko<0xC5><0xA1>tunica said.
“This meeting lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the soil of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word on the status will be the Kosovo parliament," adding that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would take place "by agreement" with the West.
Bush has reached an agreement on Israelis and Palestinians.
At the start of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, called out by his impetus, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin talks with the intention of resolving the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations for both sides that flow from the “travel map” to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas are aimed "at concluding a peace treaty that would resolve all the unresolved issues without exception, including the central ones."
This statement includes three issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes in 1948 from the territory of the present-day state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor after the US president, stressing that the subsequent negotiations should be "comprehensive and thorough" and touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Olmert said the negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it is necessary to make sure that they are concluded in the course of 2008."
Bush defined the end of 2008 as the date for the realization of his "two-state vision", the Palestinian and Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia said it had made a commitment to Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange for the abandonment of all Arab territories captured during the 1967 wars, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview he gave to an Arabic-speaking newspaper protected by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the Black Chronicle, the official versions do not agree with what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of an investigation by the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car passed shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday through the streets of Louise-Michel in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in intervention mode, but was on patrol and was traveling at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, without the side lights on," the police source explains.
The Kawasaki green motorcycle, "unregistered, and therefore unlicensed to ride on public transport" (read below), driven by two youths without a helmet, drove "very high speed".
“The motorcycle crashed into the police car from the left side after not giving priority to the right,” one police officer said.
A blood alcohol test carried out on the vehicle crew turned out to be negative.
The condition of the car (cracked front, broken windshield, broken bumpers) indicates the severity of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had entrusted the investigation of "acts of unintentional killing and non-assistance to persons at risk", the département of which is also under the auspices of the Valérie de la direction de département.
On the occasion of an afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation led by the IPPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of the police officers for the accident.
The three witnesses, who were interrogated on Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, namely that the mini-motorbike approached them relatively quickly from the left."
A rut, no doubt caused by rubbing the clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained enchanted until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
An autopsy was carried out on the bodies of the two victims yesterday.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was a rapid spread of talk among the people that the police should leave the scene without providing first aid to the two young men.
The IPPN should also, with all due care, rule out "any serious wrongdoing" at this point.
"This is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which you need to be very careful," the police source said.
The newspaper "Liberation" met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
"Immediately, we ran down with our cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to resurrect them," the witness said.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he saw "a squeaky, completely frightened policeman.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth was on the phone."
Faced with growing tensions and the certainty that the young people’s situation is hopeless, the policemen were driven by a car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police".
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities have not rushed to help the young people.
First aid has been provided to these young people.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
“Everything has been done to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, some 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the state of emergency were wounded by tear gas grenades, which witnesses say were used by law enforcement.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers over the weekend.
Access roads to the Supreme Court were blocked by roadblocks on Monday morning to prevent a rally.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement gained the support of religious parties grouped in the politically strong Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "recommanded the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency, and waste to those who stood in front of Musharraf".
"Musharraf's promise is not true"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, he was expected to comment on the legality of re-election of President Musharraf in the indirect presidential election held on 6 October.
President of Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s judgments,” the official told The News.
Parv<0xC3><0xAD>z Musharraf's promise to relinquish military leadership and become civilian president "does not apply" after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform until November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The deputy information minister also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted ongoing speculation in the country that a deputy army chief should have ordered President Musharraf to be housed in prison.
More than a third of pregnancies still make up an unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes unintended pregnancy (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected pregnancy.
More than one in three (36%) pregnancies are still unexpected today, a study led by the French Institut national d'études démographics (Ined) - the State Institute for Demographic Studies - reveals, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which enacted contraception in France.
This calculation includes unintended pregnancy (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected pregnancy.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% rate of failure, Ined estimates.
The legalization of contraception has only allowed for better "fertility control," the institute says, noting that the rate of hormonal contraceptive use among women between 20 and 44 years of age rose from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births are well planned today.
One in five have births even calculated per month accurately and, if possible, in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of the year for the birth of a baby.
Remarkable repair of the space station
More than seven hours of work in space was needed by astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to make a remarkable repair to the shattered solar panel necessary for the station’s further scientific activity.
It was a risky exit into space, which collected records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, the speed at which it was planned, and the degree of "cutting" that the astronauts spent on the repair.
Trouble came on Tuesday as the Discovery astronauts unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a sort of lander for lab modules.
However, they need to be able to supply electricity.
The crew’s second task, therefore, was to relocate the seventeen-and-a-half-ton module generating electricity using solar panels, which was already on the ISS, to anchor at its final site.
After moving it, the crew began dismantling the seventy-metre solar panels of the module.
And in it, one of the panels, decomposing like a pulling harmonica,as a result of clamping the cable, was damaged on an area of almost one meter.
Decomposition was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally supposed to perform a control exit on the Discovery ship, and subsequently go to repair another solar panel, the rotation system of which had a malfunction, were forced to devote to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, added to the arm of the station, and did the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (spacewalker) of the U.S. Air Force and Space Agency (NASA).
He is tall, strong, very agile, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was assigned to the doctor by "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed some "floor" to the damaged places.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker", who remained near the balancing chamber, and also from the inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, namely a mini-hockey stick clad with an insulating device to prevent electric shock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "by the cutlery" made by the astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely disassembled and then inventoryed his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day's rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS stock weakens
EADS shares are losing noticeably on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aerospace and defense industry company announced it would have to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS has lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96.
The financial group was forced to reassess its projected production results for 2007 as a result of the delays resulting from the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which is a prerequisite for the launch flight.
The price for mitigating delays in deliveries of the military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was calculated "at 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European designer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new profit outlook before interest and tax (EBIT) when it presents its quarterly results next Thursday.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that EADS production results in 2006 fell by 86 % mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, namely the giant A380.
Initially, the group expected the first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
Decision for the status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without tense expectations: The Russians will elect President Putin's party, United Russia, by a majority.
Thus confirming, after the end of very little free election campaign, their desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin will communicate a pre-recorded television message to voters on public radio stations, the contents of which are kept secret.
He does so from the position of leader of the United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that is likely to celebrate a crushing victory.
When he accepted foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president did not let anything out of him and contented himself with another attack on the West accused of meddling – his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we wish for the fairest, most transparent and openest elections, elections without the slightest flaw in beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "never before have such dirty elections been held, not even for Yeltsin."
After the repression that followed last weekend’s demonstrations, former chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to be banned, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have a homo soviet mentality"
Against the backdrop of these parliamentary elections, free of tense expectations, two far more open questions emerge:
"Who will become Putin's successor in the presidential office?
The Official Gazette yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until December 23.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third term in a row.
However, no follower appears.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the almighty party of United Russia, which will choose a government and a president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win on the whole line in parliamentary as well as presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have a homo sovietica mentality, they do not feel themselves to be masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the St. Petersburg State University has more distant connections: civil society has been delayed, in this country five centuries after Europe, Christianized; that famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has built on a paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, rather than that this new paternalism was not a terror, but a certain economic well-being," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “voluntarily give up their personal responsibilities”, which they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think about it?"
This phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old professor: "Why think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded memory (memory)
After more than sixty years under a confidential regime, the Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of the 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are being opened to the public.
The 47 million archival documents stored for 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) have so far been accessible only for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or her authorized persons.
Eleven states in charge of managing the archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States is at an end, the opening yesterday became effective.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to investigate “particularly the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced labourers,” explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were against making these nominal documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation?
The registers of the concentration camps or detainees assembled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced work subordinated to civilians, bringing them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are dealing with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India already amounts to almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said.
In April last year, EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (Accords de Libre Trade, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU's ninth trading partner.
“The free trade agreement is hugely inflating both economies” and “India will gain better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported to India by Manuela Baroj<0xC3><0xA1>, the European Commissioner summed up. The Asian and European giant together annually traded "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", declared this week by Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Smadja, the head of the European Commission's delegation to the European Union in New York.

The Bank of England took note of concerns and offered <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England announced on Thursday that it intends to alleviate current concerns about worsening credit market conditions once again, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion bid at a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an offer that has been unusually long in force.
"In an effort to alleviate concerns that the conditions on the financial markets will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty in the way they secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during the maintenance period, which will begin on 6 December in the form of a new operation, the Bank said in a statement.
The bank specifies that <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will thus be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT until January 10, at the basic interest rate.
This seems to be the first time BOE is pumping cash into the financial market in a five-week open-market operation.
It normally lasts a week.
The BOE adds in its communication that it "remains ready to take further measures to maintain inter-day interest rates" on inter-bank loans at the same level as its base rate.
The interim interbank interest rate was 5.829 % on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has settled at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to fee rates, which have discouraged banks from taking advantage of this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many prefer to opt for amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more discretion guaranteed.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union pour un mouvement populaire) and NC (Nouveau Centre, Nouveau Centre) refuse to discuss Socialist (PS) proposals on purchasing power
Clubs UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the various sections of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which equals rejection of the text.
The text of the draft law was put on the agenda within the framework of the so-called socialist "nest" (meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS presidency, among which were an increase of the employment premium by 50%, a resumption of the variances in the TIPP.
Given that the UMP and NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before the televised speech of Nicolas Sarkozy.
PS chief Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of appendices to the amendment to the Finance Bill, which will be discussed by the House next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculation that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, this promoter/producer announced the Vineland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with the Festival of the Republic of the British organizer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a man who has unabatedly inspired the current festival movement in America,” said Charlie Jones of C3’s Billboard.com server.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is the summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s most recognized festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006, Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, has also been in charge of production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury “the most inspiring event” he has ever experienced, saying his company and Melvin Benna are working together to give the region a European-style festival event.
“Initially, we chose Philadelphia as the market, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to establish a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“I was working with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, due to the current leadership of the city, we have become entangled in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional location that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005, after excelling on the festival stage in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross revenues for both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in an urban setting.
“The European model of Melvin Benn’s festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in the green spaces of cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two concepts in a way that creates the impression of both a rural festival in Europe and an urban festival in America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Overall, Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims that "they are advantageous enough to allow them to invest in such an event and welcome a festival that will hopefully last a long time."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will accommodate 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed at a time when the program is only being released.
“Vineland will have a rock touch, but the music there will be varied to attract a wide range of viewers if possible,” says Carlie Jones.
C3’s partners, who won the Top Independent Promoter award in the last year of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It’s not easy to attract a Hollywood film studio to Montreal when the Terminator himself is up against it.
This persuasive mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
But his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions".
Is it hard to get the "Governor" in the claws??
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where to go.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our job is to offer those they think are the best,” he said.
A tribute to festivals
For now, however, Denise Turcotte’s priority is to promote local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether it’s Sundance, Denver, Seattle, or San Francisco, it’s all about introducing, highlighting, and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
The Age of Darkness had good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer at Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year? Experts divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year and investors are already holding hands with me in anticipation of a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure it will happen.
Banif believes that “from a statistical point of view, December is having a positive course on the stock market”.
However, it is not appropriate to make predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially since, in the current context, markets offer, at least in the short term, certain doubts.
These experts do not assume that the stock market is moving in the last weeks of the year, and say that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially solid income affected by the effect of turnover in both high-quality and high-value segments."
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "particularly because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of oil prices and the dangers of stimulus to inflationary pressures."
Javier Barrio, BPI’s head of sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to boldly declare that the marathon will take place.
"There are not many reasons for joy," assures this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4% of its peaks on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could end the year slightly closer to 16,000 points thanks to the regrouping of portfolios and traditional retirement deposits that occur annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year will be a little different, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after an extended weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
The analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "so we could observe an index reflecting the U.S. reports on the consequences of the credit market crisis."
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles to take Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is a row on strong titles".
This expert would include both major banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, “because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive.”
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves at this marathon if it happens.
“ACS has been regaining its position for several months now and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technologies will also perform very well, even if they are not too represented on the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December was only a month of decline in two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the meltdown of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will see if 2007 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (so far, Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Banka Popular has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
The same goes for the other Spanish entities, as it is the first group that has decided to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly stated that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
Meanwhile, it intends to conclude an agreement with trade unions to cancel 75% of their opening hours on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, albeit not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be decisive for whether or not other entities supporting the opening hours of trades will join this initiative.
This is exactly the goal of the project that Popular Bank has set out for itself.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, businessmen and shops from selected streets, where branches will be opened.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, as it is not about opening new branches, but only about modifying existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernizes the branches it already has in business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
Thus, the extension of the opening time is complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the bank’s chief business officer, said the restructuring would not involve a large investment, but would involve more staff as it moves from six employees to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Banka Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera explains.
Branches were selected in Madrid's streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a and, according to Rivero, it seems to have been a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 immigrant specialists, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model when a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our clients,” Rivera said.
They have just agreed with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antenna 3 for the first time on the stock exchange
We've done it.
Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade yesterday when he stated that the television he runs had doubled the value of its rival Antena 3.
Only one thing ruined his joy: 'What I'm sorry for is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we fell less,' he said.
But he added that due to the weak market, “we’ve fallen less.”
Telecinco ended trading yesterday with a 2.54% shift.
This profit moved their loss over the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The market value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) thus according to Bloomberg data reaches 4 488.88 million euros.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and has fallen by 40.5 percent since January, has a half-worth of 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that have been assessed is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (publisher Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1.779 billion in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 offers, because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price, and how we will evaluate it in tracking."
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first television channel to surpass the billions in gross advertising revenue this year, according to Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s advertising affiliate.
If the predicted figures were actually achieved, this TV channel would see an increase in advertising turnover of 3.6% this year, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, Antenna 3’s net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to 734.4 million), while its net revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts focus on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock market is the increased pay-out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, divided 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
I hope this year we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, with whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its estimates of Telecinco’s profit by 4 % in 2008 and 7 % in 2009.
This is because they explain that the projected revenue growth has stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenna 3’s projected profit by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves MiFID transposition effective November 1
At the same time as parliamentary negotiations ended today with a vote by Congress on the novelties included by the Senate in the bill, the government submitted a public hearing of a regulation developing the new law with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of each party unanimously highlighted the efforts of MEPs and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable the provision of financial advisory services to both specialised companies and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services company (ESIS), financial advisory company (AFI), which joins securities companies, securities brokerage firms, and securities companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of transactions with financial instruments is expanded by joining multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems to the regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stockbrokers.
The law also obliges investment firms to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management on the market, and requires CNMV to keep a record of all operations performed to simplify supervision.
During the debate in the Congressional Trade Commission, a number of adjustments were included, among which stands out the fact that securitised claims were considered a "complex" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor that was demonstrated by what happened in the US with high-risk (hypothesized) loans.
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally designate the functions that bachelors in economics and business management can hold 30 years after the Royal Decree, which sets out the professional functions reserved for economists, was approved in 1977.
The Senate also included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized ISC increased by five decimal places to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is consistent with the policies of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will be available on 14 December of this year.
"The ISC will continue to remain at a relatively high level"
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the November ISC increase to 4.1% is a "temporary number", but also predicted that the price index will continue to be at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes stated in the Congressional bulletins that "although it will not be a favorable number", Spain's inflation differential to the monetary union has remained "more or less" the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the economy minister said of the data presented today.
Virgin plans to make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock got into a crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion).
The bank then managed record deposits of more than <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, which gradually declined over two and a half months of client mistrust despite the government offering a 100% guarantee for the money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the name of the entity with its Virgin Money brand, needs to earn about a quarter of the revenue invested in British banks over the next three years in order to earn the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion and reach the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom for its prominent advertising campaigns, plans to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock Bank this week marked the offer of the Virgin consortium, which consists of three other companies, as the one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totana Arrested for Alleged Corruption Practices in Construction
The Civil Guard detained the current mayor of the Murcian city of Totana (from the People’s Party) in the early hours of this morning for his alleged involvement in the corruption practices in the construction, which were uncovered this week.
One of the town hall’s secretaries and the local police chief were also arrested.
In May of this year, José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current MP and until then mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources addressed by Cadena SER television, could have been the "head" of the entire company.
Police continue to monitor city hall and construction commission buildings and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, a lawyer, Juan Morales, the main suspect in the corruption practices in construction, which were uncovered earlier this week, was charged.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'people's' MP Juan Morales, who was examined, was arrested while leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
Moreover, according to investigative sources, Morales’ alleged commission collection for his signing of a construction agreement with a Galician construction company, which re-qualified 200 hectares of land, is the subject of the investigation.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepted an offer to lead the PSOE candidate state in Toledo and, if they win, to preside over Congress
Former Minister of Defense José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Socialist Secretary General José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero to stand in the next general elections at the head of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo, and in the event that the Socialists were elected by the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party of Spain, the Democratic Party of Spain, the Democratic Party of Spain and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
This was announced at a press conference by the secretary of the PSOE for the organization José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapatero, which took place this afternoon at the party's federal headquarters.
The chief executive justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He also noted that "yes, it seems" that this La Mancha politician will be a Socialist Party candidate for Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as President of Congress, who on November 15 announced his decision not to run for office in the next general election and to leave his active political career in order to be able to dedicate himself to the fight against climate change within the framework of university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister was constantly urging him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He also said that just like the citizens know who will be the deputy minister of the economy, if the PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who will preside over Congress.
If Bono wins this role, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect and not of rebuke or screaming" and achieve that "it will become more and more like the citizens".
"Unfortunately, the only place in Madrid where there is no peace and quiet to talk about is Congress, the Prime Minister of the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on one occasion."
In the same way, he expressed praise for the current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, and "his good work" and did not want to present himself in his place, so as not to reduce himself to what his opponents might consider "majesty".
Climate Propaganda
Since the anti-climate movement is subject to relentless persecution, both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles, it must show strong cohesion.
In addition, having a leader of a movement that is Prime Minister like Zapatero believes that this fight is more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why the actions or inaction of his government have significantly contributed to Spain's failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors it happens, and why his government, the government of the treaty, did not prevent it.
In addition, it forces him to explain to the Spaniards as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be damaged, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who is sacrificing themselves and who will pay for saving the planet.
But such explanations have not been, and will not be, expected.
It’s because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers’ Socialist Party) seemed to Zapatero so risky in terms of elections that he hastened to reject it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet so that it costs nothing, pure propaganda, slogans lacking any real meaning.
Powerful phrases, committees, committees, protocols and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, does not blame, does not demand anything, but is adorned with rallies and arouses tenderness.
If he restricts himself to being just a virtual contracting party and doesn’t ask us to ride a bike and cool off with the fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totana arrested on suspicion of corruption practices in construction
According to investigators, the Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian city of Totana, the "people" of José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one businessman in the hospitality industry, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to the town hall, in whose premises he is now located, together with a number of police officers, who also arrived at the Commission for Construction and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Lands and Apartments.
These three arrests were added to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during an operation associated with the redevelopment of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to land suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying an illegal period of 4 000 mints, could build a house there.
In addition, two more people have not been arrested, but are charged in a shortened trial in the first instance court of the city of Totana.
The first six detainees were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana and today the member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, his former wife, the owner of a real estate agency, registered today in Totana, and also his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the Autonomous Region, were charged.
Manuel N. A., the director and owner of Nuaria, a lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigran (Province of Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M. G., the director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and through which bribes were transferred.
The investigation is carried out by a group of criminals in the construction of the Civil Guard’s Central Operational Unit, whose members, in addition to arrests, also carried out eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to the arrested, with headquarters in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (province of Madrid) and
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana, a well-known poultry-meat business owner who could serve as an intermediary.
Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcian city of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was re-qualified and its project was to double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to the support of the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking on the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela, and Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing, and Preconiza, which sells and sells directly.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this commentary from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the report of the PISA program on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers printed on November 18, on the same day that Blackbury was shot down.
"The subject of philosophy has penetrated into public debates in connection with the tragedy at a school in the city of Jokela.
The victim killer, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the education councillor responsible for the subject of philosophy, requested on the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical stance on Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools.

A colleague informs about the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a criminal offence with a rate ranging from six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you alienate a plate in a shop for less than 400 euros, it is considered a mere violation (<0xC2><0xA7> 623.1).
B. If you alienate up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 in a store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the criminal rate is lower than for withdrawal (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for the withdrawal (Section 244.1)
D. It is less important to participate in a fight than in a compact exchange.
Participation in the riot has a rate from three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the replacement of compacts, the rate would be from six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious in accordance with <0xC2><0xA7> 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading the film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is punishable by vice rather than the provision of pornographic materials to minors (Section 186).
So if my colleague's not mistaken, somebody's got a hand, and that's right.

My attending physician writes to me one of his articles on strange research titled “Money Causes Brain Activation, Especially If Others Get Less.”
Or the feelings that the monthly pay raises for employees depend on how much they earn from their colleagues.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of the Neurocognitive Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The greatest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague did wrong."
The researchers observed that if both were successful, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one was doubled, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.

For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting Balkan war criminals from the State Prosecutor’s Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings as the main culprits of the massacre in Srebrenica, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, former General Ratko Mladi<0xC4><0x8D> and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>, are still at large.

What kind of insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a significant expense, which depends on various factors such as age, condition, sex, length of hold of the driver's license, the type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurer and the insurer.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract, which provides that the insurance company will receive an agreed insurance amount in a certain amount to take care of paying damages in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined with regard to various factors such as age, condition, sex, length of holding a driver’s license, type of vehicle being insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower insurance, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies concluded that people living in marriage have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of rides, and thus the probability of having an accident.
Increasing the frequency of rides increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when determining the price of insurance.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the insurance that best suits his profile of the insurer.
Here we will show you the most important variables for choosing a type of insurance, which, in addition to satisfying the type of insurer, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five face a variety of disadvantages, such as little driving experience and short driving licenses when they want to take out insurance at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks with an insurance discount so that they get insurance cover for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would entail the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
"The part of the insurance event payment provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the insurance price, which will be the higher the lower the participation would be," explains Luis Noguera, Chief Executive Officer of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance broker.
Another option is insurance extended to other road users by insuring the customer against damage caused to other people, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of a vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under twenty-five, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that an insurance company has.
On the contrary, the malus is an increase in the mentioned basic rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," explains Noguera.
After exceeding the twenty-five year limit, it is easier for drivers to get insurance, as the client’s risk index is reduced, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks with a discount.
"Young people usually cannot take advantage of the experience gained in advance at the time of the accident, or even during the driving," the director of the European company in Spain assures, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of the procedure, when the "fear of the newcomer" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows it.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies as clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (which could be 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other road users, starting with the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their driving is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount," Luis Noguera said.
Pensioners are advised to take out insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (which is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150) or insurance extended to other participants of the operation, if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would suit us most in view of our personal situation.
Celtic tries to get AC Milan point, which means eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strength this Tuesday at San Siro Stadium in an effort to get the point they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, as this would mean being first for Italy and would decide the placement for the Scots.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the lead in the fifth game of the draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but needs another one to make sure that Shakhtar does not get ahead of him with six points, who will play with Benfica, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round ends, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they first enter the thirteenth in the semi-final, in an effort to advance to the final, which is played on the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed earlier than the others and an indecisive result at the Giuseppe Meazzy stadium seems to be the most likely, even though both teams will try to compete for the win, because the Italians will not want to tacticize on home soil and Celtic knows that after the win, the winner would be the first.
Gordon Strachan's team could even lose if Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't rely on it, because with the same nine points, the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1) but won in the first straight game (2:0) will advance.
So AC Milan players will try to spoil the night for the Scots, who believe they will reach the semi-finals for the second time in the reorganized Champions League just as they defeated them in the same match in the previous competition with the goal of Kaka in the extension (1:0) after the state of 0:0 in the basic playing time.
Hoping to win the "rossoneri" will be Shakhtar, for whom it is worth winning, only if Celtic lost, both for progress to the eight-finals and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, although the last and not able to continue in the highest European competition, could reach third place with one victory, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 viewers since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) just before they began their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver, they said.
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also included a video depicting the history of the band, which sparked a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time as they release a new album, which is released in Spain by EMI, and which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets given to them by their husband "Posh Spice", British football player David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, even though the nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that she "didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what she would think of the show."
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to discord between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also revealed its nervousness when meeting journalists two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the group's reunion, which she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled down and we all love each other very much."
However, many things have changed since the last time the Spice Girls performed together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with a Virgin Airlines special.
An army of nannies was waiting for them at the airport when they arrived.
Five have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
It will take place in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns over new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A dispute over gas prices between Russia and Ukraine is currently underway, raising the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises Ukraine’s gas prices, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia’s state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, try to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more, as it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in the course of the negotiations,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
“Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine.”
The latest major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused Gazprom to cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a crushing drop in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one-quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas supply in the world, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom is replenishing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must check foreign employees"
The inspector said the Scottish chambers of the NHS must improve checks on criminal records of non-European employees.
Recommendations from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow airport.
Mr Black also fears that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of the amount of foreign staff it employs.
But his report emphasized that the other key checks were carried out in an orderly fashion on a sample of five health authorities.
The president of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in staff from countries outside the European Economic Area immediately after the attacks on Glasgow Airport in June.
Eighty-two-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of linking to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS is expected to inspect foreign staff for qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland to check criminal records, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines, which helps employers with controls in several countries.
"Although we found that part of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out on a regular basis," the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS is in many ways in line with its own pre-employment screening policy, but also added, “Our report highlights areas where the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information about the number of foreign staff.”
BMA chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment controls at the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what additional value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers will probably be higher also because the commissions had a problem identifying staff with residence permits.
The survey also found that the established control procedures at NHS bodies in the Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian areas are being exercised to a large extent.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish government is currently revising the policy and directive on pre-employment controls for foreign NHS workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this job immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport."
She also added that the Scottish government, in agreement with the health commissions, will consider the report's recommendations and ensure that best practices appear in the updated pre-employment screening directives for all staff - including foreign staff - that she plans to issue next month.
Joy Division has won the film awards.
Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
The award also went to Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until the role of Curtise, director Anton Corbijn and the supporting role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for the thriller The Scandal Notes.
And bondage star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting the British film on the world stage.
The awards were presented at the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film - the soundtrack of which includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost only <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
But he won Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic U2 album packaging of Joshua Tree, two awards – for best director and for best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning film - as Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for Best Documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won the award for Best Actor for his role as the Russian Mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg's Eastern Promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of hard guys, won the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film.
This fiftieth man, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another part of Indiana Jones - The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he is proud of this award, which is named after the movie star Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my man, the great actor of his time, and I'm very honored."
Independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 People for Terrorist Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia said on Friday it had arrested 208 militants for their membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities as well as on clerical and security forces.
State television, the largest oil exporter, said one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have been campaigning against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since 2003, that is, since the invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight foreign-led militants was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid response unit to defend the facility from al-Qaeda’s failed attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted an internal statement from the ministry: 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “rocket firing expert” who slipped into the country.
She also said that the militants planned to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
Twenty-two detainees were expected to prepare for the murders of clergy and security personnel.
The government has urged clerics to do more to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting allied troops and the U.S.-backed Shiite government, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider a heresy.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities have co-opted many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants - backed by calls by al-Qaeda leader Saudi Osama bin Laden to focus on the pro-Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," the interior ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member “media cell” in Medina was also arrested, which was aimed at promoting “Takfiri thinking” – an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
Among the detainees were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus is perhaps a glimpse into the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the European orbiting station show that the planet is even more similar to the Earth's twin than previously thought.
Venus is the Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago Venus had conditions similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the frightening greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and lower rotational speeds sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and ravage it by storms and winds of hurricane strength.
Findings from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express probe, which has been studying the planet for one year, offer a dim glimpse of how Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the heads of the Venus Express mission said: “It is increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to compile a scenario in which Venus began just like Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police Detain ‘Enriched Uranium’
A kilogram of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was detained by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people had been arrested and the material was being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
It's still coming.
Mitt Romney said that for presidential candidates it is not worthy to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters uploaded their questions to the video and submitted them to the candidates for transmission.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday was as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions and answers this time reflected much about the state of the Republican Party heading for elections next year.
It is unclear how exactly the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the strongest Republican topics.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn the dice when they heard something pleasing: the voter recorded the peaks of approval when the candidates spoke of hard access at the border.
The hardest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who rose to prominence in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on an illegal immigrant.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
The two fought particularly fiercely when the respondents asked if any of the candidates would support the "amnesty" (give illegal immigrants a normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Supporters such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to throw their bit into the mill on the subject.
Neither of the two has a chance of being nominated, but both remain in the game perhaps because they started beating the alarm because of immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, candidates have roughly the same opinion: greater rigour at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, coupled with concerns about toxic toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate started to be very uncomfortable when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One respondent asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Through this, Mr. Giuliani came to the conclusion that although the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all assumptions in a recent Iowa poll due to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide if Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning laughter.
The fight remains extraordinarily open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa comes amid recent successes in raising money and the loud cheers of Ron Paul at Wednesday's debate.
The two fell off the bottom because the two wings of the party still could not agree on the more familiar and traditional candidates.
In the 1980s and 2000s, one candidate united the party very early and convincingly with a winning report of American size on his lips, blinking on both sides.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Labour
Gordon Brown once again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although this is customary in British political scandals, this is by no means particularly spicy.
No orders seem to have been sold, no bills in the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been kissed.
But barricaded Gordon Brown would have bypassed it without being discovered that some wealthy businessman for four years had masked the <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) of the ruling Labour Party’s contributions under other people’s names, and that the party hadn’t announced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision was unaffected by polls, there was hope that it would ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly humorous deputy chairman of the Liberal Democrats put it, the once feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unscathed rescue of the troubled bank Northern Rock showed weaknesses in the management and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought out proposals to change the tax code have brought together companies against the government.
The loss of personal data among 25 million people revealed an unimaginable administrative vanity.
Three retired generals started a revolt in the House of Lords; they protested cuts in military spending, arguing that being commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are multifaceted gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary General of the Labour Party (and their former guardian of internal discipline), has resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irresistibly heading towards his end.
Despite this, governments can reach a tipping point at which they find governance difficult.
The people don’t trust politicians and don’t like them, but they usually reject their distrust when a new party takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is probably not going to improve anything, and he may not be in office for a long time, this eviction is gone: the state administration is becoming hollow, ministers are starting to do briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one sense, Mr. Brown’s position is particularly complex, as he cannot take the position of a new broom compared to other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and financial records are associated with decisions that Mr. Brown made as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in Blair’s problems, such as the lengthy investigation into the financing of political parties caused by “values for money,” voters can safely assume he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's troubles aren't as bad as they look.
These presumptions aren't as terrible as the conservatives do.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been duped.
And the cure, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm, and slightly brutal government.
The recent upheaval around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says that he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not on him.
Laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams’s progress but did not know it was illegal, will surely be thoroughly interrogated; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labour money-seeker, who learned of the sleazy donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not at all involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these skins, even though most of the payments were made only after his arrival in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but diluted his resolve by reaching out to a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - even more so, led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding an independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not been in existence for six months, and moving on to a real reform of political party funding.
This would require Labour, who are in a tight spot, to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with the unions – bitter pills for a devoted party like Mr. Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way to win a victory is unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks (disambiguation)
Does the subprime mortgage crisis affect the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, the spinal fins naturally begin to stir excitedly around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is collapsing, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say credit card losses could reach $99 billion if other consumer credit variants were infected by subprime mortgages.
The signs of tension are obvious.
There is an increase in the number of inability to pay (more than 30 days late payment) and depreciated accounts (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable).
HSBC announced last month that it has lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market – also due to insolvent credit card loans.
But it is too early to panic.
Depreciated accounts and inability to pay are still few.
According to Moody’s, the insolvency rate in the third quarter was 3.89% almost a full percentage point below average.
Deteriorating rates can be partially explained by technical reasons.
The change in the US Personal Bankruptcy Act of 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies that make up a large part of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore rise regardless of whether the general conditions for lenders deteriorated.
The industry also has a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts monthly.
And trust in the securities of secured credit cards is solid, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup predicts their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct ways to spread the infection between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market: when real estate loans dry up, consumers are more likely to indebt themselves via credit cards.
However, credit card issuers tend to look at cash flow rather than the value of warranties, so falling home prices may not necessarily mean a change in lenders’ trustworthiness.
They can even be beneficial for loan providers.
Consumers’ motivation to repay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, debt on cards moves up the list of repayment priorities.
Card issuers are also able to respond more quickly and flexibly to turbulent conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of rapid change in the prices of warranty items.
“It doesn’t happen that we just reconsider all loans one morning,” says Gary Perlin, Chief Financial Officer of Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of subordinated mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry will stand before a darker future.
Watch your back fins.
British Bankers Admit Guilty in Enron Case
Three British bankers, who were to be tried for their roles in a fraud involving former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, resigned on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud when they and Fastow were supposed to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- enriching themselves on behalf of their employers -- they denied.
They were due to appear in court in January.
However, during a court retrial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one hoax.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was featured on the front page for two years, which took the issuing procedure.
In the United States, their case is one of the unfinished pieces of investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow to the fact that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron’s collapse.
The indictment against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "the NatWest Troika" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to design a fraud along with Fastow and his former chief aide Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a Fastow-controlled Enron affiliate, which was the architect of many Enron scams that pushed Enron spiralling into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its stake in this branch zero, but our three Britons knew that it was actually of considerable value.
Under Kopper's control, the company bought the bank's stake in this branch for $1 million.
The incriminated bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for his stake in the company.
According to the Fastow prosecution, Enron falsely informed that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
But those 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers received $7.3 million in the indictment, and Fastow, Kopper, and others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons moved freely on a $1 million bail order ordering them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks it was no longer possible to hide billions of debts or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year of their roles in the company’s downfall.
Skilling is serving more than twenty-four years in prison.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were erased after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-impotence
The price of the Gulfstream G550, powered by a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the wealthy Russians, however, it is small to return.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a close family or a company president."
Mr. Firer sat at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Exhibition, a four-day orgy of lavish consumption at the Mammoth Exhibition Centre on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers built their booths, hoping that the newly wealthy Russians would lure everything from mahogany-shaped yachts to diamond-decorated car shelves for which not even 50 Cent would be ashamed.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the side stand.
"It's a nice car, but it's fives and tens against us," he said.
After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market.
On the waves of oil, money pours into the Russian capital just as it did when Dallas had its days.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans became enormously wealthy and moved to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians become the world’s most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their piece on this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, the luxury industry conference attracted Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets such as the Russian one.
(The conference is hosted by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes magazine’s list of the richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total fortune of 282 billion dollars.
The Center for Economic and Financial Research also published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "second-class" millionaires in Russia, whose assets total $670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the existential minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jewellery David Morris.
It was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are flawless, and men are all for their fortunes."
When they walked through the halls in their evening dresses on Sunday evening, twenty-one-year-old Evgenia Yumatov<0xC3><0xA1> and five-year-old Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tlana Turovcov<0xC3><0xA1> identified themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at those cars, and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes, and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who dressed like a veteran of the red carpet, alongside whom Joan Rivers looks like a housewrecker.
The fair seemed to be focused primarily on fresh rich, brand-controlled Russian shoppers, who are willing to sit down for a few hours in road traffic to be able to walk through the warehouse, which screamingly mixes Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fishes, ice cream dishes.
Members of the public could buy tickets for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's painting of a hand-painted blue tile in life-size.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in gold."
And in fact, local sellers say that Russians with old money (according to Russian scales it is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from flashy logos to few known brands of limited editions that would never appear at the shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires' envoys or simple tourists, flooded the trade fair halls every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said that he sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, intertwined with gold threads, for $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, which modifies luxury cars on request, said he had sold three chain-linked car lattices to the Rolls-Royce Phantom for $55,000.
He showed a reporter a car wheel designed for the Russian casino owner, which had a knit coated Swarovski crystals so that it looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of them.
“The Russian millionaire who wants a leather ostrich wheel or a portrait of his wife from cubic zirconia doesn’t have to ride those wheels yet,” Karapetian said.
"They'll put them in their garage for 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently does not mean anything very exclusive, given the large increase in the prices of local properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be wealthy at a stand run by the Russian firm Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company erected four red, British-style phone booths stuffed with a million-dollar column of fake banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires Fair.
The passers-by stopped to throw money around the pile, or to have their friends photograph them on their mobile phones resting in the middle of their spare wealth, or simply tossed a few million in their pockets.
“You know, everybody in Moscow can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey May Have Been Caused by Corrupted Surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out the big windows of the restaurant a little healthier and watched an ambulance arrive at a white New England house two blocks down West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car soon joined in.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the forensic delivery arrive," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"I knew at that moment that someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine whether she died from a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to find out what caused Miss Arroy's death, and hope that toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks to come, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness to the Newar police.
Ms. Arroy has been an assistant to the Police Director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tough, and hard-working," Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroy in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr McCarthy said Ms. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York City police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and left behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for Union District Attorney Theodore J. Romankowa, said the detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroy died from the consequences of an unlicensed surgery.
"That's one of the options," Ms. Walsh said.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about three o'clock in the afternoon.
In November, they found Miss Arroyo on the couch.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is supposedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't say if the authorities had heard Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday in Miss Castro's house, with a ruined rose bush in the front yard and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door that led to the cellar, there was a blue barrel in the open garage with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes were hanging on the hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York City for 25 years, Ms. Arroya gave him invaluable help in biting through the unbearable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful of this or that,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes the Fed will cut interest rates lead to stronger world stock markets
Share prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm the lending conditions by further lowering interest rates were reinforced by reassuring statements by the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
The stock exchanges jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line to Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Fed, said that in response to continuing pressure on financial markets, managers must be “flexible and pragmatic”.
As part of an apparent effort to soothe irritated markets amid the signs of a revival of lending efforts, Mr Kohn said that recent turmoil "partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of markets at the end of September and in October".
Furthermore, he said that if the increased instability persists, the possibility of further deterioration of financial conditions for households and businesses will increase.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver additional fresh installments of capital to U.S. markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid other bad news about the U.S. economy, when apartment sales in October posted record lows.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it will cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of a cost-cutting effort to compensate for the heavy losses caused by the misguided bet on subprime housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these sites are expected to be abolished in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York City, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index boosted by 2.65 percent.
The London-based FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to 6,306.2, while the value of British blue-chips rose by more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion.
The German Dax index rose 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets showed themselves in full force after these funds were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001, in the auction of three-month money packages by the European Central Bank.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release over-the-counter money to London’s money markets has surged as rates for three-month British interbank loans “Libor” rose after uninterrupted growth from Nov. 12, to a peak of 59 percent since its end.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the Board of Pickers, who holds this position at best in borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision to help, and because the board of pickers is headed by Hugh Morris, the head manager of the Board of Pickers.
He who is not placed in sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It’s not easy to find what gets you to the top of your profession, while someone else never gets you through a lower level, sometimes because of a lack of happiness rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, the selection is challenging and requires judgment, which in the end always has to be subjective.
Is it a good time for Bopara to move up?
Is that fair to Shah, if so?
We could ask the same thing in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with a good education and track record in the industry, should be promoted to the committee - there's only room for one.
Who's to say what level is right for a cricketer when he's not given a chance to drop or swim to the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a big impact on decision making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must capture the captain's gaze at the right time, whether to take the wicket, and the batter needs regular chances in starting positions, whether to ever make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the view of the picker is more complicated.
For example, last season there were many better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harrison declared himself healthy and pitched as an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 overs.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same modest average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hope for the next.
Whether he will play at the Asgiriya Shah stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can kick-start or reach a career of both, or it may not have much impact either.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and in the first class he gave good performances, five wickets and 40 away runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time was fighting for his place, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer, who was also a scorer in Australia.
Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores are more likely to follow their conservative instincts after another discussion following today’s training session at Asirgiya Stadium, preferring Shah’s greater experience to Bopar’s youthful lavishness.
There are arguments for both.
Shah speaks for his sparkling and valuable debut Test shifts at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first class against the six Bopars, who are, at twenty-two years old, seven years younger and have excellent statistics against spin overheads.
However, Shah made in two shifts in May against the Caribbean at Test at Lord's, his home ground at Middlesex, just ten overs, and this, along with the immediate rejection of the pickups, when Vaughan wanted to take him over again for the next match, his firing seemed to be at the
The Essex universe, on the other hand, has the joy of living in the bones.
On the cricket pitch, nothing scares him, and his off-court behavior symbolizes a recently overturned four-wheel drive car at the exhibition day of the English team’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He got away with minor injuries and apparently shock, but first he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who watched it remotely to ask him excitedly, "Did you see it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his moderately fast skating overhangs on the local playgrounds that seem to suit him, distributes effectively and fires confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that’s the real art of choice.
Personally, I am inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that Shah will not excel if, as the Ceylon tea cards suggest, he is the one who will be playing next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaida
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday and toppling refugees who had run out of money or expired visas, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the gunmen who had driven them out of their homes.
The Mansur bus station was already there before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read about in the papers, what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
“They say Mahdi’s army has stopped killing people,” he said, referring to the Shia militia of militant cleric Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariya called him, saying that local self-defense with U.S. military support helped push al-Qaida out of its positions west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is a leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who was expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rebel against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
“The day before yesterday, a few friends called me and told me that militias were running against al-Qaida in Sleik and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, age sixty.
Many spoke of the attraction of calm in the capital after the strengthening of the U.S. military presence and the growth of local “groups of engaged citizens” who defend their neighborhood with weapons in their hands alongside the U.S. military.
But more than that, they were driven back by visa hurdles and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 50-year-old father of three, voiced suspicions shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the refugees’ visas and thus force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled Iraqi sectarian killers.
“Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq,” he said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the weakening of the violence is the fact that the Sunnis were forced out of Shiite areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tensions.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will once again inflame sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Little S<0xC3><0xA1>rko, good education
Germany’s smallest state plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even in the international focus of its universities.
In just one educational area, the Saarland is concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"To a man who does not come from Saarland, I explained for the 50th time yesterday that we are not French" - this self-confessed slogan appears on posters in Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal country.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar education system, which is in fifth place in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Traditionally, universities have been cooperating closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even a triple diploma.
This corresponds to a relatively high proportion of international students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the above-average number of Saar children are admitted to college - many of them even without a high school education.
“In the Saarland, a professional education system is used,” says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at IW.
By more than one-fifth of young people earning the right to study at a vocational school, the Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are plenty of opportunities in Saarland to combine practical and academic education.
Opportunities to study two disciplines are second best in all of Germany in terms of population.
Despite practically oriented education and increasing demand, in recent years the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now ordered colleges to create a promotional campaign for engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pisa, we have carried out several reforms in general education schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that is adopted by other federal countries.
If the results of the pupils are significantly improved, future comparative studies will show.
In the 2003 Pisa study, the proportion of at-risk pupils decreased from 29 % to 20 %.
Overall, however, the sarcasm has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better at counting.
And to the disappointment of S<0xC3><0xA1>rsko, Pisa studies do not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise S<0xC3><0xA1>rsko could score in this area.
The language of the neighbors is mandatory in high schools - even if the inhabitants of the Saarland are not French.
Chavez shifts the clock
What not to see will go hours in Venezuela differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez will allow the clocks in this South American country to be pushed back by half an hour.
In Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
The official newspaper of Venezuela reported that the clocks will move by minus four and a half hours compared to world time under the new law.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chavez, the enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by the United States forcing the world to divide the time zones over the whole hour.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced on Wednesday that he was breaking ties with neighboring Colombia because of the hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist has said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
“I can’t because of my self-esteem anymore,” said Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of this oil country must vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The dispute was triggered by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate to negotiate with the Marxist rebels in Colombia on the release of the hostages.
Uribe's decision "spawned into Venezuela's face," Chavez said on Sunday.
Also in Spain, everyone is talking about Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez.
The new mobile ringtone caused a stir here: "Why no te callas" (Why are you no longer silent?) - this is the phrase that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
It was spoken by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who, at a recent Ibero-American summit, was so upset by the vocal remarks of this leftist populist that he silenced him in this way.
Germans at risk of lower wages in 2007
According to the forecast, this year German employees are at risk of a reduction in real wages, despite the strong economic situation.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007, employees can actually expect to receive lower wages than they did last year.
"The blame lies with a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and an increase in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung (IMK) told Bild.
New burdens on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% for the new year is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not again fall into such difficulties that it would have to demand loans or contributions from the Federal youth, the newspapers of this social democratic policy quoted.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the price explosion of food and oil products pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In the year-on-year comparison, prices rose by three percent overall.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth.
Venus Express, the European space probe on Venus, has recorded phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind gusts at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is glowing.
Now the European probe Venus Express has brought proof - it has captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at a height of about 56 kilometers, wrote in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to a well-known theory of the origin of the primordial matter, life could have been created on Earth by lightning. Storms allegedly triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
“If there ever was life there, it must have been a long time ago,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes there are temperatures of around 500 °C on the surface of Venus.
"He may be the hellish twin of the Earth, but he's the twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, began to evolve in a completely different way, is a fundamental question of the mission of Esa.
Since no spacecraft has been sent for the study of Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of Venus Express in November 2005 has been a milestone in the exploration of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest results of the research, which brought together several articles in the journal Nature, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more Earth-like than previously thought," said Esa.
In addition to the already known winds at the North Pole, scientists have found a dark swirl at the South Pole that spins much faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system is almost the same mass as the Earth and with an average of 12,100 km it is almost the same size.
This planet, known as the Morning Star or Evening Star, will orbit the Sun in about 225 days.
However, it rotates much slower around its own axis, with one day on Venus lasting 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus is not reminiscent of a surface temperature of 460°C and a pressure of 92 bar Earth, scientists believe that the two planets originated under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, but on Earth it remained in the oceans, while it evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, it forms most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler is calling for an end to party disputes over the acceptance of the Dalai Lama into the Chancellor's office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves externally as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
“Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me,” Köhler said.
The German president stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but that did not prevent Merkel from standing up when she was told she was creating a new policy towards China.
"The Chancellor has not given up on the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows that, too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disagreement with the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition’s “preventive” foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL magazine it also froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve of European politicians officially accepting a Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions, which are also located on the territory of China, is trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar riots that erupted in France
Street battles with the police, shootings, burning cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that erupted in France.
We must do everything to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not grow into violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior calls for.
Barricades were on fire, rioters fired shotguns at the police, and after serious riots in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to be careful not to create social tensions in our country, which will erupt in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the Hannover-based Neue Presse newspaper.
Not every young person is able to cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, the country and the municipalities are already working hard to address the problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
“From the Summit on Integration to the Conference on Islam, we have seen our first successes.”
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
Over the past few nights, youths and police in the northern suburbs of Paris have been fighting hard on the streets.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were called for by the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
With regard to the riots in France, Kolat warned of a "imitative effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "above average" high.
Above all, more opportunities for study should be provided.
Kolat emphasized, "We must give hope to young people."
The head of the Turkish municipality added, however, that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Moreover, many young people from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, "But we have to be careful."
We need to enable young people "to quickly start working and educate themselves."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained mostly quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were on duty and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorized authorities have reported three arrests and several burning waste bins and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 law enforcement officers have been in charge of the peacekeeping operation.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
Around 80 police officers were injured in riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The following night, the riots in Toulouse took over.
The incident was caused by a car accident on Sunday, in which two young people died.
According to the prosecutor's office, the police bear no responsibility for the death of minors.
In the realm of Angela "The Clouds"
The chancellor’s reality-distant exit documents that the coalition is programmed to end and that we can no longer expect anything more from it.
In which country does the Chancellor live?
After her inconsolable, indifferently sounding and content-poor speech at the general debate of the Bundestag, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she should, after all, manage.
To the remorse that she is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once responded with a very arrogant sentence.
This is provincial, she said, showing that she does not want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the House of Commons, she has clearly shown everyone how much she deserves this remorse.
There was no real interest in Merkel, let alone a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblukov<0xC3><0xA1>" presented herself: a politician who excels above others, who flees to foreign policy and expresses herself only mistily there.
For example, climate protection: it is constantly praising the conclusions of the summit in Heiligendamm, but it is no longer saying how to achieve the climate goals in Germany.
And at all, such self-praise - so much immodesty would have been forgiven by the CDU president two years ago.
Now it is limited to flattery phrases that could increase its popularity among people.
This approach damages his image of a pragmatist who does not need to flatter, because he solves problems.
But in Angela's "Clouds" realm, internal political problems are a marginal issue.
Child poverty and concerns of low-wage people?
There are a couple of side sentences on these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel rebukes herself when it comes to child allowances.
Three times Merkel must start from the beginning in order to be able to pronounce at least a partially correct sentence.
As soon as things start to be too specific, he stumbles like in a completely foreign terrain.
the Attack Department
The debate among Republican presidential candidates on YouTube has erupted into a heated debate over the favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney – and both must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident in the first issue.
Mitt Romney told his rival, Rudy Guiliani, that he had made New York a “refugee for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani quickly reacts with sharp remorse: "I think his own house was just one such refuge," he responds, quoting the former governor of Massachusetts, who privately employed undocumented immigrants.
Given that the Republican base has not yet a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their rivals.
Half-minute videos, shot by internet users and uploaded via YouTube, serve only as such help of a key topic.
“It is precisely through this policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to seize power,” McCain told his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one who advocates the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain doesn’t spare Romney for refusing to condemn a tortured interrogation method called “Waterboarding,” which simulates heating.
The reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that the campaign’s important topics are neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture.
The public bursts into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
This will show you where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, vehemently, asking the party base and the television audience for forgiveness for being a proponent of abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed when it comes to the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf for the first time in civilian rule
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief of the army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Parv<0xC3><0xAD>z Musharraf took the oath of office on Thursday and will remain in office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony, which took place in the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to honor the constitution and seek the welfare of the people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as Commander-in-Chief of the Army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyanim, subjecting himself to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on November 3.
According to the Supreme Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyuma, Musharraf will abolish the state of emergency soon after his oath, thus fulfilling another of the requirements of the West.
The country's highest court, which had appointed Musharraf's lawyers after declaring a state of emergency in early November, rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Crowd is Back
The famous German band of the seventies is playing again. Three members of the group Harmonia at a concert in Berlin again grabbed their electronic synthesizers.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
At that time, they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation then lies in the performance of three sedentary gentlemen, who at first seem to be just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and buttons in front of them.
Thirty-six-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
To his left is Michael Rother, who has a laptop and guitar in front of him.
Thirty-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who leans over the synthesizers, is from the viewer’s point of view on the right.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by default, a traditional composition will be created.
It doesn't seem to bother the musicians very much.
The revival of the band Harmonia caused considerable commotion among the lovers of the rock band.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of the pop, but it is certainly not so far-fetched that someone for twenty-three years painfully misses this band.
But why couldn’t even a German celebrate his still-living legends of the 1970s?
And especially when the musical style, mistakenly called krautrock, is valued more in England and America than in their own country.
When in 2003 the music business awarded the surviving members of the Cologne group Can the Echo Award for Lifetime Achievement, the hall was full of questionable views of German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their speech, the audience’s amazement no longer knew the limits.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers at concerts as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia we unnecessarily overload the memory, this trio existed for only two years and even at that time it did not have the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
They initially played in the basement of the Schaubühne Theater in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at a church-run record company.
Rother briefly helped out with Kraftwerk, but gained a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of the band Cluster into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, the ruins of the 16th century, lived as members of the commune who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to work as a nanny.
It was more of a life in such a Spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for the art is supposedly derived from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir, whose badge was allegedly found in the ashtray.
A lot of it was kept by Harmony.
The first album was called "Music from Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so quiet and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Collecting roses was not just for self-knowledge.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was reportedly cut in front of a record-breaking small, barely 50-member backdrop at a concert in Griesse.
At the time, Rothera expressed the wish that the members of the Harmony would exhale and exercise occasionally.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a completely unscrupulous request.
In 1975, the band announced their split.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album Burning Heart.
The band Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
For the live album from Griessemer we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company Grönland set out to provide krautrock as an original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered to be a solo work by Roedeli at the time.
The physical resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at Woldtronics will be publicly sponsored.
There will be Brit, Julian Cope, an old punk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
The founder of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also attend.
We have thus outlined the overall breadth of the influence of the krautrock on the future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group is filled by Harmonia.
Brian En's sentence, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats in the hall: "The only true music belongs to the future."
There are paintings on which the producer is in harmony with the farmer's seat.
The creation of the legend also contributes to the projection of other black and white photographs, on which the set of devices are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans were again employed by improvisation.
No longer by gluing microphones to the organ and drums, to make those never-before-heard self-made tones lured out of the instruments.
Today, electronic music is like electronic music.
Three to the technique of submerging the dots.
There is no change in the House of World Cultures.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers in the clouds of sound, and in one beautiful place, she sings emphatically "Aaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would have found roots rather than in blues at music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in flight from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts '68 at this place is not so far from the truth, but even now Harmony will not let himself be taken out of the stillness.
Even the most obvious is being thought through on stage.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This question will either deprive a person of nerves or allow him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But neither of them is convincing.
The template of the films either places too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
The Hunting Party doesn't stop an actor like Richard Gere from doing that.
Good news first: War criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the gloomy backdrop of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Lately, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he played in many pleasant, non-serious roles in well-being women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the topic of Buddhism, one will take a taste for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the hunter becomes prey (Why do movie titles have to be so long and tangled these days?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry hadn't been so merciful: a man who has his best years behind him, but as a wreckage-like monument he still preserves a certain remarkable.
But despite this trump, The Hunting Party along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which is also entering cinemas this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of unsuccessful films about the Balkan war.
With the film "Mörderischer Frieden" we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who will save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, and one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television-thin film changes too soon into shooting and action.
There will be something much like the Kobra 11 series from the film, although without the highway, but for that with the war.
In the film The Hunting Party, one can clearly explore why a really good film has not been made so far about the Balkan War.
The story of three American war reporters pretending to be a "fox," a Serbian top war criminal, could possibly become a new "Apocalypse" at a different time and under the guidance of another director and screenwriter (here is Richard Shepard).
After all, the two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the forest to do something the army is unable to do, but their path becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the cheeky and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the proposal also prescribes for him a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can be definitively written off after the reporters in the last five minutes of the film are guided by what NATO, the CIA and all the world’s criminal hunters have failed in the past five years: to catch the criminals and leave it to the just vengeance of Bosnian Muslims.
This is so contrary to the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
This film has a profoundly human message.
He denounces Karadzic and Mladic as still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (here they are exceptionally united) that they are not pursuing it with enough intensity on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women will think of Brecht's famous poem.
It is about the wooden mask of the Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the runny veins on the forehead, remarking: how hard it is to be evil.".
In movies like The Hunting Party, there are exactly such swollen heads that suggest how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war in the Balkans.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all the Hollywood films about Iraq were big failures.
One thing to add to this is that no good South African film has ever been made.
Almost always true: When a star walks through a crisis area or walks through a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Borders of Breaking with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCapri is created.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it had to take decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler's List.
Many films seem to have to mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "Deer Lover", "Apocalypse" or "Red Vest" - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Writers, then, do not have the ability to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps he has to form a sarcasticly measured artistic outlook like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and "The Balkan Wars", he said: "The only thing that makes sense is that some things never change.
“Cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust has been criticized for denying the Olympics.
The mayor's resignation from hosting the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has come under sharp criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the organization of games on the water.
Von Beust, however, calls for realism in the estimation of chances.
The chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called the decision "business-wise unfortunate."
No other project in the city has recently aroused as much motivation as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm to such a high degree.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday at his earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Federation will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Union will decide on the candidacy of Munich for the Winter Games in 2018.
“This preference for us means that with a 2028 timeline, we don’t have a realistic chance.”
Yet the dream is not over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust’s remarks regrettable.
It seems that Hamburg does not want to participate in the organization of the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It's too early to destroy our chances by calling plans buried at this early stage," HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
Rejecting the application would be contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate, which he made at the General Meeting of the German University Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the University in 2015 as a substitute for hosting the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg University of Applied Sciences has only been nominated as a candidate city in the past week.
The SPD faction in Hamburg’s Senate parliament said it was wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area was hampered by the Senate for years because it bet on hosting the Olympics and ruled out the construction of apartments," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area was still planning the Olympics with the whole area being later used for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg has sparked great enthusiasm for its time.
But Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
If you combine the terms Sweden and wooden boxes, you don't think of Andy Warhol, you think of Ikea.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes currently manufactured in Sweden cast dark shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of his list of ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo Boxes" in 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo Boxes" are more than his "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 were donated to the Moderna Museet.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curative events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes that were based on the reddish-brown design of paper boxes of Brillo soap powder.
The exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but their designs, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo beds in Sweden, but these are not on display in the Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the time now speak of fifteen boxes that at that time rightly entered the artistic and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred bends were made and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hulten bends were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of the Moderna Museet, explored in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood plates were painted with a varnish on the base.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, revealed that the paint was applied directly to the plywood board by the painter's role without the previous base paint - in addition, it is acrylic, not oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box list," said Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board's classification of materials in New York does not come to any other conclusions, Moderna will be
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would address these “core charges” in the case of soap powder boxes.
But the organization is still in inexorable silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers fortified themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Insurgent commander Antonio Trillanes, who denounced the president's manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours before, about two dozen soldiers had fortified in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were on trial for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the negotiations to flee with about 30 of his sympathizers.
The military policemen who were supposed to guard him apparently rushed to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government loyalists have closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We are calling on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers, said more troops would join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government called for a major demonstration against the president on Friday.
For months her government has been plagued by corruption.
In 2003, the Manila financial district became the main site of a rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroyo.
Because the rebels refused to join the army, the rebellion collapsed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made to overthrow a democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes Versatel's majority shareholder
United Internet secured a more than 20% stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05% of its share capital.
There was speculation about the takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its share in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator by another 5 % to 15.1 %, the deal was announced on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this money institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had already a 10% stake in Drillisch, the provider of mobile telecommunications networks.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold another 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
Of this, 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing cooperations in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesperson said.
In order to take over the competitive company Freenet, the companies together set up an SME Joint Undertaking.
United Internet said on Thursday that the two companies were satisfied with a stake of more than 10% in Freenet and would not exercise their right to take over another 18.49% of the company.
It is considered that all options remain open for the time being, in particular the possibility of further increasing its stake in Freenet AG.
The talks between United Internet and Freenet regarding the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This months-long and difficult-to-transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract mobile network customers and 1.27 million customers with complete or DSL connection.
Holding United Internet and Drillische so far held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will acquire an additional 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
