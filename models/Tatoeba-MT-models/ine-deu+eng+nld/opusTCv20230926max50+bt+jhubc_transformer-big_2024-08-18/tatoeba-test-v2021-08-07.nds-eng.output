Your lips are like roses.
Your mother must have been beautiful when she was young.
You say it's your use to burn incense. Good. We also have a use: if Keerls burns a woman alive, we tie a rope around their skin and hang them up. Boat joins fire piles; next to that my carpenters will open a gallows. You dare us to use it.
You'd rather have shot him before.
You're gonna shoot your father.
You'll shoot yourself through the contract before you sign it.
You shoot you go home before it gets darker.
You will shoot your children to be a good example.
You shoot more time outside and less inside.
You shot to accept my advice.
You take the bus with the number 5.
You sound like an eco.
You're talking.
You talk as if you were the boss.
Do you think that television is bad for children?
Have you read this book yet?
You drank three cups of coffee.
You've had eleven buddel beer!
You have made a mistake.
You've exaggerated it.
You were late yesterday.
