Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in shop in San Francisco
The twenty-eight-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was the staircase of a local shop this week.
But the victim’s brother says he can’t imagine who would want to hurt him, and adds, “He’s finally starting to do well.”
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eight-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the office of a forensic doctor said.
The San Francisco police department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
Victim’s brother Louis Galicia for ABC KGO in San Francisco said Frank, who used to be a chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokeswoman for Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and destroyed” by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a close-knit family, and we will miss them very much," the spokesman said.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in hostels, but that recently "he finally started to do well."
"He found an apartment, went out with a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked our food, he made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any fights.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was a rough diamond that shone every day,” he said.

Czech railways have invested over 31 billion euros in the modernisation of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, state-owned carriers have invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years with the exception of 2012 are gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, Czech railways have invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was shown to reduce the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic wagons.
A larger share of the investment was given to the carrier in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money was directed, and 40 percent of the company then invested in the renovation of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, the upgraded older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernization of the vehicles were not counted, the average age of the propulsion vehicles of the Czech Republic would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger cars are slightly older, with an average age of 23 years when taken into account by modernization.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
In recent years, however, the classic sets consisting of wagons and towed by the locomotive gradually disappear from the Czech and worldwide railways and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of locomotives dropped from 280 to 223, and the number of classic cars dropped from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier disposes of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking openings during the journey.
From January to July, 110 of these vehicles were wrecked by the carrier.
Among the investments that <0xC4><0x8C>D plans to make in the fleet in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic rapids.
The contract counts with the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editorial office of the online newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where there is not only a tourist-interesting walk in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
Highway managers know it's black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of similar ads across the country.
According to officials, there is a sleazy law that makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
First of all, we need a complicated bureaucratic wheel.
In the meantime, however, the company will change its name and the office is short on it.
Or just push the advertisement a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main stretch from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice to Lipno stands on our land near the state road advertising billboard black.
Three months, however, were not enough for the officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable constructions with a huge billboard.
It’s as if it doesn’t bother anyone to stand right next to the road, in a 50-meter protection zone where nothing can stand for safety reasons.
Road managers say they can’t easily deal with billboards because of the law.
Maybe load it up and take it away.
"We can't just afford to do that," said Nina Ledvinova, a spokesperson for the Directorate of Road and Highways, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that billboard removal must be prevented by law.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which the online newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz began to watch in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and the authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In southern Bohemia alone, the editorial board counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules right next to or near the road.
There are other countries in the same way.
"We have trouble forcing the company to remove pilgrims," confirms the head of the transport department of the Czech Budweiser regional office, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kl<0xC3><0xA1>sa, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to Kl<0xC3><0xA1>sa, there is a pervasive law to blame, which binds officials.
First of all, they have to contact the owner of the billboard in order to put the advertisement away.
However, the heads of companies are often inaccessible or know the finta, which Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz described in the past, when the issue began to be more detailed: it is enough to move the mobile stand with the advertisement by a few meters and the officials can use the previous call to remove the black advertisement.
This is because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, they see it as a new device and we have to address the owner again," explains Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kl<0xC3><0xA1>sa.
The new law won't help.
The change could be brought by a new law, which will ban billboards on motorways from September next year and restrict them even on I-class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for tackling illegal and easily transmitted ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities don't like it.
Companies can still make tens to hundreds of millions of CZK a year on illegal land leases, and no one can do it.
For example, a billboard attracting to Lipno belongs to the company Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the Czech Budweiser magistrate is currently running three administrative procedures for black-built billboards.
The company faces a fine of 30,000 in each case.
These are multiple advertisements that were placed without permission in the protection zone of the I. class road.
The drive has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mr<0xC3><0xA1>z, head of the transport department of the Czech Budweiser Municipality.
Advertising, which Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz is interested in, although it is not yet listed among these cases, but it will most likely be added to them soon.
Nina Ledvinov<0xC3><0xA1>’s company did not respond to repeated written requests for removal, according to the spokesperson of the RSD, and the case will be brought to the regional and then probably magistrate officials’ table.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can’t get in touch.
It does not take over the post office and the official headquarters on <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC5><0xBE>kov canceled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's mail went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representative of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard company leases and sells the space to advertisers, has denied any connection in the past.
In the spring of this year, when the RSD began to take an interest in advertising on Lipno, Fischer had state officials send a letter for the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the allegedly new company is located.
However, no one from this address has responded to the highway administrators so far.
It's a futile fight.
Similar silences or opaque changes in settlements are not uncommon.
A few years ago, we gradually fined one company two million crowns.
But she changed the name and the I.C.O. and there was nothing to solve.
The executor returned the case, the advertisements continued, perhaps in other places.
We are quite helpless against similar companies and their business practices.
It is like fighting against windmills, admits one of the officials, on condition of anonymity.
No one has yet addressed the new law in this regard.
He spoke to a number of MPs who were interested in the problem.
However, they have not yet developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for retaining billboards at the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for national, but also regional and municipal politics.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions, on the other hand, they themselves need them for advertising in election campaigns.
I don't get the fairly established impression that if something doesn't work, then the laws need to be changed.
Farmers are harvesting less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy, statistics estimate.
According to estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest of cereals this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Yet this year’s yield is above the average for the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
Cereal harvests will be 6.7 per cent lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is based on an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and predicted a decimal drop against last year.
Last year’s harvest was above average.
This year’s crop is above the average for the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy will be higher this year.
Rape growers harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got 1.256 million tons under their roof.
This year’s poppy yield could be 2.5 percent higher than last year’s.
The projected decline in cereal production is due to both a 3.7 per cent reduction in the yield per hectare to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the area under sowing.
Farmers have sown 3% less land this year.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is expected to harvest 3.3 percent less this year.
The farmers sent her out into more fields.
However, the decline will be marked by a lower yield per hectare, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
About a five-fifth decline in statistics is predicted for spring barley, which is most commonly used in beer production.
The reduction in yield is due to a reduction in arable areas of 15.2 percent, but also a lower yield per hectare.
Winter barley, on the other hand, will be born 6.3 percent more.
The grain harvest will also grow.
Rape yields are estimated at 1.305 million tonnes, up from last year.
The harvest area has expanded by 7.3 per cent.
However, the yield per hectare will be 3.2 per cent lower than last year.
This year’s rapeseed yield will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 per cent, while it is sown on an area one-third larger than it was ten years ago.
In the last four years, there has also been an increase in poppy fields.
This year, the farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when poppy was grown in the Czech Republic on a record 70,000 hectares, the field is half.
Thanks to the expansion of the seeding areas, this year's harvest of poppy will be richer.
It will rise 2.5 percent from last year to 27,423 tonnes.
However, the yield per hectare will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police accused two men of attacking with a knife and machete, the court sent them to detention.
Police have accused two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in the center of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, they caused him urinary and incisional injuries, which required treatment in the hospital and further treatment," police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trb<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The two suspects were arrested by police immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff filed a court's request for their arrest and the court agreed to it on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police have accused two detainees of assaulting a 35-year-old man in central Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The attackers caused him urinary and incisional injuries, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that happened on Tuesday at the right noon in the Freedom class, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trb<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
A mass clash between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal clash, two attackers attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete.
Although the man tried to escape, he suffered urinary and incisional injuries that required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokesman said.
The clash, which attracted a lot of attention in the city center and which had to involve several police guards and officers on the spot, was a family dispute.
Forensics accused a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc of trying to cause serious harm to health and rioting.
The plaintiff filed a court request for their arrest and the court agreed with him on Friday, the spokesperson added.
The machete was used in the center of Olomouc by the attackers five years ago, only a few dozen meters away, in front of the discotheque Varna in Riegrov Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about ten foreigners with guns attacked the company’s guests standing in front of the entrance.
Police said they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then sentenced the two attacking foreigners to probation.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You will be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most excruciating examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of the Old Town Square.
It should have been a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
Is it necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what to use the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several mansions that, despite their location, size and often monumental protection, are only empty and empty.
We selected properties in the center using the project Pr<0xC3><0xA1>zdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or belong to a state that does not know or wants to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
That the owners pay a special tax for them, he wants the initiative

Clinton’s husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars went to Clinton for charity.
Most of the Clintons’ income — over six million dollars — is behind their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican rival, Donald Trump, to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of Clinton’s revenue — over $6 million — is behind their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton began her campaign ahead of the election.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s spouses levied a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, followed by a state and local income tax of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
Trump, however, has a problem with a similar move, so far he has not decided to release the tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump is not paying any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after publishing her confession.
Clinton repeatedly goes back to secrets about Trump’s revenues, among other things, to raise doubts about whether her rival is indeed as rich as she claims.
Trump’s fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower income would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, in tandem with the former First Lady, who is running for Vice President, today released a report on his tax breaks over the past decade.
Together with his wife, Anne Holton, they donated 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and taxed 25.6 percent of their earnings last year.
There has been another outbreak in Nigeria.
Islamists from Boko Haram prevented consistent vaccination and killed doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of childhood measles have reappeared.
In the north-east of the country, the government announced an emergency vaccination, as two children infected with the disease became paralyzed.
Vaccines were transported by helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram defended the vaccine and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated unnoticed.
In the north-east of Nigeria, the emergency vaccination of children against measles will begin, because there two children infected with the disease became paralyzed.
In Africa, it was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday swiftly transported vaccines against measles to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had circulated unnoticed in the area for many years.
In the past, Boko Haram extremists have defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks on Thursday also prevented doctors from reaching areas where children with osteoarthritis were found.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from a part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for the eradication of measles, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
In the state of Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has been active for a long time.
The area was only made available to international organizations and the government at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram was able to significantly weaken in this part of the country.
Nigeria’s health minister Isaac Adewole has admitted that new cases of measles are a big disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that the measles had been eradicated in it.
The WHO noted that it is possible that although the disease did not appear for two years, it still spread among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all cases of measles in the world.
Whereas in 1988, poaching was still present in 125 countries, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of thugs thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for the fight against it to be intensified.
Pope Francis met in Rome with twenty former prostitutes who were liberated by the police from the power of a gang of thugs.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the moving stories of the fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30 years old.
All were subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
During the visit, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for the intensification of the fight against it, the pope's spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fates of people on the fringes of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this year in April and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France is going to hit the factories of the jihadists.
Without the help of Muslims, this will not happen.
In the fight against radical Islamism, France is assisted by Muslims themselves.
The government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is also preparing fundamental changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clerics.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer halls.
And more will follow, the interior minister announced.
There are more than 100 jihadists in the country.
"Unless Muslims help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee that faith," Valls said.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer halls.
At the same time, he wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad.
About 20 percent of the money is currently coming from abroad to build new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This is also the reason why preachers who can sow radicalism in France enter the mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," he said.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The French Foundation for Islam was founded in 2005 by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time, the foundation was supposed to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institutions were soon struck by internal contradictions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate broke out about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All this has been hastened by other terrorist attacks in France carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently made it clear that a new foundation would be established in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise the imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take the money not only to build new mosques, but also various educational centers.
However, several proposals are under consideration.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal foods.
Here, in practice, halal food vendors would pay for providing certification.
Some of that money would then go to the foundation’s cash register.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
About 30,000 people travel to Saudi Arabia each year on a traditional pilgrimage.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, in the future, only preachers who have gone through special educational programs at French universities should work in mosques.
This should ensure that the sermon is consistent with democracy.
Close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is campaigning against the radicals.
And more will follow, the interior minister recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and prayer halls in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled about 80 imams, and several dozen more are considering it.
However, not everyone thinks that the government’s actions can significantly interfere with radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
It is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint with the star Baug.
For the process to the eight-finals, the Czech track cyclist must fight in repair rides.
Track cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro after progressing from the sprint qualification among the best eighteen lost in the 1st round to the French giant Gregory Baug, a silver defender from the previous games in London.
He has to fight for the progress to the eight-finals in correctional drives.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track stood 27 riders and the best Czech rider of the moment has assigned himself the fourteenth best time.
He hit the 200 with a flying start in 9,969 seconds.
In the main knockout phase, he was thus awaited by the fifth Baugé, who already has bronze from the Ria in the team sprint.
Kelemen eventually reached out to an experienced Frenchman, but he kept an eye on the procedure.
A great performance was gleamed by gold defender Jason Kenny.
The 22-year-old Brit took the third fastest two hundred in history and won the qualification in the Olympic record of 9,551.
As expected, he easily dealt with the last advance, which was the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet was also successful in the line-up with Bradley Wiggins, who reached a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4 km chase race and advanced to the final.
The current maximum (3:51,659), which the British owned four years after the Olympics in London, improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Push: They Want Fresh Wind in the Industry
Representatives of young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The Board of Young Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the entire board for support for further industry events in early September.
The JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve questions about the treaty.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted to reject the contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who took part in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “still silent” on issues, prompting the deal to be rejected.
She said: “In this light, the executive branch of the JDC, by voting, has decided to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to ask for new formal negotiations on all issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Executive Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Board to approve the ongoing programme of endangered industry events in early September.
The dispute led young doctors to announce six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of young doctors in the BMA, Dr. Johann Malawan, resigned after a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which the BMA recommended.
He told BMA members at pre-voting meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister said the contract would put a strain on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: “Incompatible” Alliances?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to the eight-month-long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the luxury hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I had the impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yes.
But Putin did not laugh and hardly radiate heat from it, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken about his "dear friend" to Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their pre-crisis level, but they will be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper reported that Erdogan was acting as if nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that radiated from Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting down of a Russian warplane by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was furious at the time.
Putin was lashing out and accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The embarrassment was all the greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
State-controlled media for months led a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it looked like the Turks could do anything.
More serious were accusations from top officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message came that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin got the apology he asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared a victory as well.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost powerless during the failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s sanctions have had a severe impact – notably the cancellation of charter flights that transport several million Russian tourists to Turkey’s coast every year.
This number decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies are sure to take a rest when the flights are resumed.
They make money on the Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when the import of agricultural commodities from Turkey will be allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Vedemosti newspaper.
The visit, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it considers a weak response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-standing hostility of lengthy talks about joining the EU and Putin’s entry – who yearns to be able to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly earned bonus points when Ankara asked him for the help of the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change, this is the case.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to show what one analyst described to me as “an alliance of the incompatible”: how the forces of the two countries feel to be rejected and exploited by the West.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently took on the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of introductory talks, both presidents stated at a press conference that they had not even mentioned this issue.
The Turkish president deliberately chose to answer the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight those differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries could find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and given the risk of a total disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet — it is certainly better that the two leaders talk to each other again.

According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand is to be relegated to the role of back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
She was relieved of them when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategist brands used “RBS” to protect other consumer finance brands.
It has cost millions of pounds to sponsor international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new trades.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more into the foreground – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt’s Military Bank.
While traveling to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand our employees work for as we become much more of a brand bank now.”
Because the bank itself has become a global brand, it has become a global brand as well as RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, has prepared the profile of individual brands sponsoring the sport.
“The time has come for us to move to a brand bank, because the fundamental question (which we ask ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?” he said.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would have become a great bank for customers and introduced those brands.
But along with how we’ve focused on customer needs, not our own, I think there’s a lot of change going on.
We can remind these marks again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori at Newmarket on the horse Predilection led to the goal of the 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory at Newmarket brought him 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in the UK at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second victory of the evening on his local track - the Predilection horse, which is trained by John Gosden.
Forty-five-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in flat racing.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion Jack Dettori, who had previously won on a Ghayyar horse, said, "It's weird."
I'm very impressed because my family is here too.
I am extremely glad that it happened in Newmarket, because it is here that I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I was relieved and I am very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when she brings Predilection after the victory
Two jockeys of this milestone have reached in the obstacle course - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who over the course of his career has achieved a record-breaking goal of more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from other riders in the weightlifting.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he hadn’t just raced on weekends and big races, he’d already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie has been riding the winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
It has a lively character, which is good for British racing, but more importantly, it is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrates his success with his famous flying jump
From glider finishers to glider jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a British flatbed racer for two decades.
It was like riding on a mountain track.
He also survived a plane crash and was banned from taking off because of drugs, but he was not allowed to take off.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a 6-month ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and returned to all doubters despite his best form.
And maybe it's not the last time - Dettori has already stated that he would like to continue the race until at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin has fired the head of the presidential office of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest associates for many years.
Thirty-six-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin “released Ivanov from his services as head of the Russian presidential office,” but did not state the reason.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012.
Forty-four years ago, he was a diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian) it is stated that later he was the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When Putin was appointed, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the Head of State in terms of drafting laws and monitoring the extent to which your instructions are being followed.
Putin said on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from his post and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Convince smiles?
This step completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin’s closest associates for a long time and worked for the KGB just like Putin.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, both men said that he was leaving the post of head of the presidential office at his own request.
But only a few people were convinced by the camera smiles - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
But the official claim that a man once thought to be a possible president is suddenly keen to lead Russia’s environmental policy has been met with great distrust.
The Kremlin’s website quotes Putin’s remarks, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very demanding post, one might even say a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I was the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up his post in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
At the time, there was even speculation that Ivanov could become Putin’s successor after his second term, because the third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close Putin collaborator Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, the star of The Criminal's Thoughts, was fired after hitting the director.
Last month in Los Angeles, Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before announcing his dismissal.
There were creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS, the details of how Gibson's character disappears from the series, which follows the stories of the FBI agents team, are a little later.
The 54-year-old actor, who starred in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has starred in the series since the first series in 2005.
“I love Criminal Thoughts, and over the past 12 years I’ve put my heart and soul into them,” Gibson said in a statement.
I was hoping I'd be in it to the end, but that's not possible now.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could have hoped for.
The series is expected to return to its 12th season on September 28.
In Banff, fish mysteriously landed in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sand eels left there by a water crumb.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short film of his finding on the Periscope channel, believing that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got to his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct – the bridge now connects to Fife.
This is the first of four “platform fans” that are now almost complete around each of the bridge’s three pylons.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment for the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnessing how construction engineers have used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this part of the bridge on an impressive scale.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extreme precision.
There is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, with concrete for the last part of the platform now being poured into Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure of every bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the pinnacle of land construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the North Tower expansion platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled with a rise of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy to be alive"
The three men are “happy to be alive” after being flushed by water from their fishing boat at Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station declared an alarm on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw an incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety, while their boat continued uncontrollably.
"We saw their boat circling near them, and the worst occurred to us," said rescue boat helmsman Moelfre Vince Jones.
“The strong wind fortunately drove him away from them before we left,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, the third man at the age of 60 was found without a life jacket exhausted as he held the fight.
All were transferred to the shore lifeboat and transported back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person driving the boat when the overturning occurred.
Someone was holding a protective hand on top of the boys.
The judge refuses to settle the case because of Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>'s wife.
Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> is one of three MPs who were accused of receiving political traffic from Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and his then chief of staff Jana Nagy, a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012 it was the approval of the tax package.
<0xC5><0xA0>najdr, Fuksa and Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> made it possible with their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state-owned companies.
They also faced suspicions of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, it was unjustified, and a total compensation of almost 2 million crowns was obtained.
Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> now stands as a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a fruit market courthouse and settles civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> wants to be cautious (resolve criminal matters - see red.) and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another district court in Prague.
The Queen has already twice acquitted Jan Nechas, formerly Nagy.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to monitor the first wife of Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Radka.
In this case, Tluch<0xC3><0xB3><0xC5><0x99> did not figure.
But according to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I believe that impartiality cannot be interpreted in such a way as to exclude the court if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid that nothing could be judged at all, he remarked for the newspaper.
"I think it's overcrowded," he added.
In the case of political traffic, Roman Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ek, a former official, is also charged.
But according to his lawyer, Petr Toman, any objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13, the Prague 1 District Court examined the indictment of the former chief of staff of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Jana Nagy (now Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asové) and other defendants in the case of the misuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, she goes to court with her husband.
Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> was supposed to deal with the statements about Peroutek.
For example, the expository’s wife was to judge President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman’s statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutko.
Zeman said he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl was apparently killed in an airstrike by the Allied forces.
She flew to Syria with her two equally old girlfriends last February from London Gatwick Airport.
The British Ministry of the Interior did not comment on her death.
Young Londoners who fled their home were secretly transported to Syria across the Turkish border, police said.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, and Kadiza Sultana are reportedly heading for their other former classmate from the Bethnal Green Academy in London.
Last year’s case sparked a huge wave of attention and also tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that around 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined radicals from ISIS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a hundred thousand dollars.
It’s a well-paid job that you don’t even need a college degree for.
This is what it looks like at first glance.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech conditions (in Prague you earn up to 180,000 CZK by working in IT), but also extreme advantages.
This is due to a lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
It is estimated that almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to the statistics of the personnel agency Grafton, the most sought after are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, it is not candidates who compete for a position, but job positions for candidates, comments Jitka Sou<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, marketing manager of Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity for the students.
Higher education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the intelligence and educational capacity of the candidate, but often does not have much in common with the knowledge of development.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which once a university graduates will not replace, says Petr Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most money is made in Prague.
The salaries of the Ajt<0xC3><0xA1>k are everywhere high above the republican average.
The most money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hitparade.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka confirms.
The highest earnings will be achieved by the technical directors.
In Prague and Brno you can find 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it does not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
At the start they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
It's also about the graduates.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the labor office, this is not the case with ait<0xC3><0xA1>k<0xC3><0xAD>.
After all, if companies drag and overpay a specialist from another company, they like to reach for a graduate.
They can raise him in their own way.
They can't do it without language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in every profession, but at least decent English is necessary for the Ait<0xC3><0xA1>k.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we are faced with a number of cases where companies are looking for a professionally educated and experienced person in particular and are satisfied only with average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, the support worker is fluent in more foreign languages, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds the director of Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Go to Google, there's paradise.
Only the Czech workers can quietly envy the employees at Google.
Of course, flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various short-term jobs are for them, not only for mothers.
"The company provides newly baked dads with an extra four weeks of leave after the birth of a child," says Martina Jonekov<0xC3><0xA1>, a Google spokesperson.
The hospice also includes health care for employees and family, catering, transportation, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Anyone who wants to get an education has a green one and it doesn’t matter what new one wants to learn.
But that doesn’t end the benefits.
Such a free full refrigerator is also definitely not to be thrown away.
Healthy lunch (in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, in all offices there are so-called microkitchens, where people always find a healthy snack, the spokesman reveals.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, so that what is not eaten, can be put in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these incredible benefits to the Czech ratios?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“It’s not important for Google that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions,” he said.
The United Nations has strongly criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN commissioner for human rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "is of grave concern that Bulgaria is not complying with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
“It is particularly disturbing to witness the importance and influence of public figures publicly expressing their support for the criminally armed fighters who are ardently pursuing refugees on the Bulgarian-Turkish border,” he said.
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid said.
And what’s worse – they are often prosecuted and imprisoned – for a year or more – if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, compared to 21,000 in the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to watch the world change.
Many people over the past decade have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people out of their shells and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens initially shrunk on television, later on video games and most recently on smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and activities outside don’t exclude each other.
I’m talking, of course, about the Pokémon Go mode, a character-based app that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards, and more were created).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest here before the launch of this new game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The listing in other countries was then postponed due to a strong interest that led to server overload.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out to look for Pokémon that they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can “take pictures” (through screenshots on the phone) or “catch” them.
Mania captivated a generation who played the game at a young age, lifting her out of the seats and driving her out to look for Pokémon.
In the US, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that the "average" person will take every day.
Apple’s Smartwatch Cardiogram app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people watched who exercised every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not have information about who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data about the levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns seeking to "find 30," "get off the couch," and "be active every day" fell to barren ground because most of the public health messages are boring and aimed at people who don't look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot list here in full.
But the beauty of the game Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
So you cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sun rays. And fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt for Pokémon.
As is the case, of course, there are such boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
What, like?
There was a breakthrough.
In their time, smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity, but they didn’t give us a reason to do something like this game.
The news comes back and interest in it begins to decline at some point.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity and help a lot of people in pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's multiplayer gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No effort at stake.
They were all silent.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The nineteen-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in multi-battles on Thursday and beat the others in full under the Olympic spotlight.
The total result of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and member of the team of the "final five" Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a performance in the singles multi-battle final in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win a multi-battle, and the fifth overall, confirming her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey to this point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This success places her in the same league of unique athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 golds. Her stunning line-ups are a mix of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between herself and the burden of too high expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are hugging each other after winning the gold and silver medal in the women’s singles multi-battle final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The first Biles won on Tuesday, when she was as a shoutout in the celebration of the departing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she has never looked forward during her long journey to the summit, which is not entirely true.
Part of her composition in simples - the one that contains a typical triple salto with a double turn - is set in Latin music, which would just fit at home, in the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's no coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and her talent was discovered by Aimee Boorman's mother on her way to the gym, where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The multi-battle competition has not lost since the summer of 2013 - this is a series of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took over the short lead with two turns, it was just an illusion.
Betting and simple - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back in the lead with 15,433 points per bet - and finished with 15,933 points in the draw.
Raisman gently embraced her as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glittering red, white, and blue shadows, Biles tears appeared when a wish was fulfilled that she had once written in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a retaliation for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third spot with Mustafin, but at the time was bronze for the sum of the three best teams.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call “grandmother,” was ahead of her.
After her simples, she sent a crowd of airy kisses, overcome by a return that at times seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where he became a total hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three Victims of Serial Killer Killed While Listening to Music in Car
According to a police report released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed during the most significant attack of a decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis Maleah's daughter were shot on June 12 in a car parked on the driveway.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the passenger and fired eight wounds from the handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
Police say the robbery is not responsible for the triple murder, because the attacker did not take the wallets, nor the amount of 2,900 dollars that one of the adult victims had with him.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had anything to do with any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks took place in four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
“It’s happening in the villa neighborhood in front of the houses,” Howard told CBS’ KPHO branch earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner, 31, and her daughter Ellis Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police it was not uncommon for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which was targeted by an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder, and police believe the serial killer was responsible for it.
Investigators found the cartridges, and from the remains of the bullets in the seat and from under the hood of the engine, they assembled the bullet.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is a consequence of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, I first thought I couldn't do this.
I can't handle this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not at all true - obviously you are ready for that," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund may never know them and may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the institution.
“My first reaction was that I thought people weren’t doing this anymore,” Picciut explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't speak.
However, some milestones are already slowly being met.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth performs a sign language by which Edmund says "please sing to me".
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a normal sign language - he says Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It’s too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of infected people.
Picciutov<0xC3><0xA1> is reminiscent of the emotional tax that an uncertain future takes on.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don’t expect anyone to be able to tell me at all.
But Picciut has an encouraging message for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods have called for rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) has reported that after extreme flooding, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi are emerging from their banks and are at risk of widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor’s office for national security and emergency preparedness, said they were receiving requests for vehicles to drive in water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the Tangipaho district had requested ten thousand bags of sand.
Flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The meteorological service said in a statement that it could rain another 8 to 13 centimeters above the sea.
In southern Alabama, a flood patrol was on standby on Friday as rain continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are expected to culminate at the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of homes in suburban Baton Rouge.
He also said that the danger is flooding after a current in Ascension district, when these watersheds will pour into Lake Maurepas only slowly.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on Friday at 9 a.m. local time.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the tidal waters of Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued at Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
We had it up to the waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family members are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the crisis workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continued heavy rains, floods are "rapidly spreading" and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rainfall fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and paid trips had prompted residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa district and to cancel classes in five school districts.
CBS's WWL branch said 200 homes had been flooded, according to a senior from Tangipahoa.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by the high water.
In the village of Amite and in the city of Hammond, shelters were established for those who were evacuated.
"They'll be able to go home when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to flooding and locals were given sandbags that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had the last major floods here in March," said Lacy Landrum, the town's administrator.
Looks like these floods are going to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, manager of emergency situations in Harrison County, Mississippi, said persistent rain was continuing on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said that on Thursday, several homes were reported to have been sunk, but on Friday, none of them appeared in the report.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods at Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in a few places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "Boy Shot As Solved", Survived Shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second shooting of a 6-year-old child in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him as Mahay Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including bruises, legs, arms, and abdomen, but he was conscious during transport to the hospital.
"He caught a lot of it, his little body was shot in the face," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station that the boy should be cured.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, the other two victims are in stabilized condition.
According to the station, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a twenty-nine-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia said there was likely to be a gunfight between several armed men.
At the site were found bullets from weapons of the attack type, belonging to various attack weapons.
It was, of course, a continuing battle.
There were bullets on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it seems that there were a few armed combatants who were actively involved," Philadelphus police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been arrested and police are reportedly investigating video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray shot Tuesday in front of a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s how I imagine a women’s team of gymnasts for this year’s Olympic Games, and for a few reasons.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of blacks and Latinos at the top of this sport.
The number one gymnast in the past four years has been an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second tiers last year.
It means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became an Olympic champion, and America rejoiced.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simona Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win gold in the women's individual multiplayer.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are witnessing a sporting summit, but in gymnastics classes in the country it does not look like this.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the team of gymnasts for the next Olympic Games will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi is training.
However, the fact is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastic clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, trips, jerseys, fees for competitions, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their trustees and family).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs, which can promote activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts this is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, both coached athletes when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls who inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly black and Hispanic origins) and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success in school and at work.
It's the inspiration that this team will send to us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics. And that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing the “girl power” and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on the journey of becoming healthy, strong and successful young people that
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter more strikes
Ministers hoped that after the revamped contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end disagreements over the changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the elections refused the contract.
Hunt revealed plans in July to enforce a contract with the NHS being in “no man’s land” and further delays would have a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work procedures to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA Committee on Young Physicians, said in a statement last night: “Young physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current workforce crisis and therefore fair treatment for all.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under the new contract, it is necessary to make progress and time passes.
The BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation have met with reluctance to involve Dr. and often with deafening silence from the government.
And this despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
“Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for enforcement, and address the concerns of young doctors.”
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed because nurses and specialists were called to represent the doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after the reworked contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be disagreements regarding the changes.
The BMA wants higher pay for work over the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the president of the NHS, urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “The industry action will achieve little or nothing, but there will be pressure on already overburdened teams and services and there will be growing concerns, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Board of Young Physicians and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of surveillance and informant.
Employers hoped that continuing positive involvement in the UK's education with other important issues - such as exhaustion, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after a career break, cost of training, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave, and wage gaps - would have led to a better education.
Medication for 60 CZK a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take the drug, which costs around sixty crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend giving it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The anti-coagulation medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrence in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for 12 months after having a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or other seizure.
The NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
A heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer breaks apart, a blood clot, blockage of blood access to the heart, and a heart attack can occur.
If the clot loosens, the bloodstream can continue, blocking the blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another stroke.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces the risk by making the collisions less likely to occur.
In the draft NICE directive, which was published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will suffer another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can extend the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Because the information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited beyond three years, treatment beyond this time is not recommended in the proposal.
With computer culture began to flourish frauds in Muslim areas
The mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was sacked last year for corruption, which was linked to a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to a disregard for widespread fraud in Muslim communities, the government report said today.
Former Prime Minister Sir Eric Pickles sharply criticizes police, election inspectors and city halls for ignoring voter abuse because of “sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former community secretary, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said intimidating voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that police should do chords in front of the polling stations and protect alert voters.
He recommended that voters take their identity card with them and be able to prove who they are in the elections.
At present, voters simply need to provide their name and address.
The report further proposes that an indelible ink be applied to the fingers of a person during the casting of the vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for the press to have greater access to meeting documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is not just about protecting against election fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and the financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets, West London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the city’s mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be dismissed from his post on charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had “cynically affected” the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his criticisms with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
According to Rahman, “he led his campaign so that it would be a religious duty of devoted Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes have been contested or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and resigns from someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern over the frauds in the correspondence vote – which is said to have put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they elected during his time.
Sir Eric, in the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including presenting an identity document.
"Evidence has been presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh."
“There have been concerns that ... state institutions have closed their eyes to such behavior because of ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including prohibiting political activists from manipulating correspondence voices to prevent “extortion of voices.”
The report, which is now being evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and gratuity fraud.
Consider asking voters to provide proof of identity before the vote.
Use indelible ink on people’s fingers during voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating surrendered correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordons around the polling stations.
To amend the laws to make it easier to prosecute persons who develop illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibit the taking of photographs in polling stations.
Require that only Englishmen (with the exception of Wales) work in polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers adhere to the rule that voters go to the polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it is “surprising” that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of evidence of a crime.
It also criticizes the unsuccessful “checking of the checkboxes” in the departments for registration of voters in the city hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court decision in the Tower Hamlets case was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some institutions threatens this reputation.
The madness of cycling duchess Kate and other doubles celebrities at the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have gone crazy this week with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the twenty-four-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold-seeking athlete this year who can boast of her own celebrity double – at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the celebrities that are currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL column for women has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than distantly similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted animal: Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonard DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's twin on the bike path, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archer Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after his images, which look strikingly like a wolf from Wall Street, emerged.
Brady himself noticed the media insanity and admitted that he had heard of his resemblance to Lee since he was a little girl.
“He doesn’t see much of a resemblance, except maybe a beard,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a guy and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be emphasized even more this year: the striking resemblance between the British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin with her big, distinctive eyes was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for the change: The user thinks that Nathan has an "athletic version" of the actor from the film The Beginning (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is a comparison between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova is not only proud of the same eating skin and blond hair as Annalynne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian of the US team, fans say that it looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Skilled women: football star Hope Solov<0xC3><0xA1> (left) and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar facial shapes and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that the similarities were noticed by others
On the Waves Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similar appearance of pairs
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction at the fact that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sola and Jennifer Carpenter are really the same.”
Football star Hope Sol and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have a really incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medalist for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her gorgeously wide smile, which would have copied the smile of the film, the smile of the Union!
CBC Olympic commentator apologises for saying Chinese swimmer “exploded”
Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympic Games on CBC station infuriated the analysis of the performance of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place in the women's 4x200 m freestyle relay race
Canadian CBC was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "drained like a stench" and "exploded" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when, at the end of the women's 4x200 metre freestyle relay, he began to sniff his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring “revival” to the CBC commentator team, said, among other things: “This little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool.”
Too much excitement, it pulled like a stench, it exploded.
Oh, thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second relay of the race at 1:57.79 - that is, 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed Canadians to reach China.
Viewers in Canada began to quickly resonate online and were horrified by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the voter say on CBC that the 14-year-old swimmer from China “exploded”????”
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's 4x200 m freestyle relay race was described as, "That 14-year-old girl from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many demanded his dismissal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn’t hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment, saying, "We apologize for commenting on the performance of the swimmer who escaped into the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment
Scott Russel Apologizes on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and posted their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about comments made by MacDonald.
The station also apologized quickly and issued a statement.
He sincerely regretted that the words had been uttered, they should not have gotten into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in the broadcast and to those who follow us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on a live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by saying he didn’t want it to sound like a personal attack.
“I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s relay,” he said on CBC’s Olympic broadcast.
"I meant the performance of the swimmer, not the person of the swimmer as such."
Needless to say, I didn’t mean any disrespect and I’m very sorry.”
Primark customers embarrassed by a woman who shamelessly tried underwear in the middle of a store
When the woman stripped off to try on her panties on the sales floor in the middle of Primark, they were not sure which way to look.
To make it worse, she tried to fit her size, stripped her panties, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and finally tried four pairs of pants in the shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried her panties before she put them back on the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman "re-dressed and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe it with their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own panties and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, bold as a monkey."
"Everyone was just watching her panties get undressed again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with three others before she finally decided she didn't like it, dressed again and left.
“She didn’t seem to mind who was watching — nor did she think of the man who might buy the panties she was trying.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else was wearing and nobody cleaned them up is disgusting."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I was picking up things she evidently tried to get out of the sale – which is also the only right thing.”
“I’d be terrified to bring home my new panties and find out that another woman was wearing them, undressed them, and they weren’t washed.”
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9th."
All the products concerned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Defend Against Weapons Attack Using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain supremacy over a rapist, whether he is approaching you from the front or from the back.
If they approach you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and “have a free range of the missile.”
You will then grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee becomes weak, and while the attacker is in pain, you twist the weapon out of his hand, hit his head in the face and begin to retreat, holding the weapon against him.
If you are approached by an armed man from the front, it is a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it out so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, put strength into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip and begin to retreat, still aiming at it.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video where you will see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of a robbery - unless you're the grandmaster of the Krav Maga - is to spend all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks Europe’s dirtiest places in a travel guide
A British traveler has decided to undergo a severe test of his immune system and a tedious reflex - licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and author of travelogues Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, to prove the strength of his immune system, approached with his tongue the euro banknote, the railing at Piccadilly Circus, a button washed on the toilet in the train and the Russian public telephone.
Before approaching each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was doing.
The experiment that led to the filming of Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the rinse button in a train that thousands of other people have used may seem completely repugnant, but for example in the kitchen sink there are actually much more harmful bacteria.
Throughout his journey across Europe, Ian Wright spoke with doctors and health specialists about strengthening gut flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of what he licked left anything worse in his mouth than the smell.
Ian Wright was famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on trips around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely - from the public railings at train stations to the rinser.
In the film, he says, “I haven’t cared much about my health since I was a child, and I’ve put everything in my mouth, from clay to worms to muddy water.”
In the film, his reputation was confirmed.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple wipe, the luminometer showed the value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia, however, refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60.
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have shot a traveler’s film called The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom.
In the film, he said, "This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
There's nothing more filthy than this!
I won't lick anything because it's disgusting here.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Valio Gefilus to Mr. Wright, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen the gut bacteria and immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would keep an eye on the fascination and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of “let’s call Ian.”
It is said that interest in gut health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a worldwide phenomenon and through this document we have provided consumers with more detailed information in an interesting way.
I also think that there is a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I wanted him to do – like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.”
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we've filmed the licking of some of those dirty things."
In 2015, Valio conducted a survey that found that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and gut health, and 58 percent of respondents reported at least occasionally consuming products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Family of Socially Deprived People Destroyed Town Hall in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needy left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damages on their town hall after being accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were moved from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forcible move out of the house, housing cooperative officials were shocked to learn that the property was in an emergency.
In the walls there were holes, the floor covering was torn, everywhere on the floor there was rubbish and the walls were smashed.
The family has already moved and is believed to be living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned that the house would be saved.
She said, “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
It is necessary to consider a number of circumstances, because this property is likely to become known as "not so nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple have three sons who occasionally stayed in the house, and police said the family’s horrific rule included street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of surrounding residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud shouting, quarrels, and insults.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was mentioned on the lease, was sentenced in June for anti-social behavior.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, fragrant waste was found.
In the house from which drugs were distributed in the past, a floor covering was ripped
Neighbors say they saw them washing in the street, and people called the police here regularly.
The Cornwall Housing company forcibly moved her and her partner out of the house this week after they were given an additional 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The neighbors, who were relieved, welcomed the emigration with the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, “They didn’t take care of anyone at all.”
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because there was an incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing’s neighborhood supervisor, said the family was unable to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called by the police
Waste and old toys were dumped in the overgrown part of the town hall
She adds: “It is a shame that the tenant could not accept responsibility for her own behavior and for the behavior of her family. Moving is always only the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to frighten her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the local community who have bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring a bit of comfort to the neighbors and at the same time carry with it the message that we will not tolerate non-social behavior.
Fitzpatrick said all three tenant sons who lived in the house at different times were around 20 years old.

Workers will now have to dispose of piles of waste that remained thrown around the house
In 2014, she carried out raids in the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was earmarked for the home for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are now believed to be living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their rental contracts
Angela Crow of the Denov and Cornwall Police said the move was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
“The police of Denov and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after low-flying military jet over beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun rays in Portuguese Aveiro were terrified to death
Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion Plane Flys Extremely Low
The Air Force said it was a training flight, and insisted that there was no threat to safety.
As the low-flying jet landed over the crowded beach, frightened tourists panicked.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane reaching a distance almost to the touch of the sun with people on a sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to pick themselves up after being disturbed by the noise of the jet engine, without seeing what was coming out of the clouds.
The incident took place on the Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted videos of a dramatic flyover on social media, said: “The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash.”
Nuno Arroja adds, “I was surfing and I really thought the plane was going to fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were shocked when a low-flying plane emerged from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight in order to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to endure low, as this was the only way to check the ships.
The aircraft reportedly flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the aviation insists that people's safety has not been compromised.
The wildfires this summer destroyed part of mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to dense fog and smoke from fires that prevented him from sighting.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessel as part of the training.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (<0xC4><0x8C>OI) found out during the checks in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services usually do not inform the survivors of their prices or issue a written confirmation of the acceptance of the order.
The IOC imposed 41 fines totalling CZK 73,000.
Today, her spokesman Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Fröhlich informed about this.
Inspectors found errors in 47 out of 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially uncertified meter.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This involved urn wrappers, candle covers and vases that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"As there are still violations of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
London Schoolgirl Who Joined ISIS Was Killed in Syria
Kadiz Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned of her death in the Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian airstrike in Rakka, which is the group's bastion in the country.
The Sultan was 17 years old and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“One wants to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing — as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with going to a war zone — is that it’s deterring people from ever making decisions,” Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan’s family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria – and within a few months she had become a widower.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of his election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland’s nomination, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the person who replaces the deceased Supreme Court justice will be elected by the future president.
During a conference call on Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would select Garland “with a certain degree of credibility.”
Reid's spokeswoman later said he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether to nominate Garland, and that he was only speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "throw a ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is chairman of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans who block Garland's appointment are "servants" and "jumpers" of the Republican candidate for President Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, there are nude calendars for "women and men"
Treats magazine is working closely with photographer David Bellemer to publish the 2017 calendar, inspired by the Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
But instead of revealing celebrities, they are trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nudity is different from the old-school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to go back to portraying timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of women’s bodies,” Shaw said in a statement.
Women want to be part of this project because it’s a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their pictures online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys turntables?
Vinyl is loved by lonely men in middle age.
Before you decide to load the comments section with pepsticky comments under the pseudonym NoAllLonelyMenMiddle Age, we would like to point out that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of turntables is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to love themselves with the originality of ownership of a physical object, but with the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people between the ages of 18-24 are the least likely.
It’s not really about amassing an enthusiastic fan – all of this has an emotional dimension: older people who buy turntables are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and are happy alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were broadcast as a television reportage, I would be watched by a camera as I go out to the busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit, and I would gesticulate widely, then I would pause, raise my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's go look at it."
Well, let's take a look.
As its charm and charm slowly fades from the heart of Soho – buildings once occupied by independent vendors – are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, confectionery and office supplies – several fantastic specialist turntable shops remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment. I will stand close to different men in these stores and try to track their age and emotional mood.
Stuart, 55, a native of Glasgow whom I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has an afternoon meeting in London and watches the shops for several hours.
I asked him if he was a collector.
"I think so," he said.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
All those tapes line the walls of his living room - pictured above (photo sent me by e-mail, I did not follow him home).
He also has a huge amount of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy record labels he couldn’t afford when they first came out, and he buys back what he sold in his youth and didn’t even have a window.
"A lot of what I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s. These are things that would have been released when I was 11 or 12 years old when I was too small and couldn't get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who like society themselves, and adds: “I don’t smoke or drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers she meets fits into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave, people who had heard of the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old turntables.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their turntables and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their turntables,” he says.
This could explain the boom in record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of turntables?
It doesn’t take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that you’ll find a nice community of people with a similar mindset in music stores.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly aggravated by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of turntables may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of turntable packaging, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring a certain amount of comfort,” says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I think a lot of people do too.
It’s an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We are all like their social workers!” says a collaborator from a pile of turntables.
A survey by ICM in April found that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables do not have a turntable.
At this point in the report, he probably looked really worried as he was browsing through a bunch of bossa nova compilations.
The "trophy" aspect and the revival of interest is something Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men), noticed.
“Someone recently came in and said, ‘I don’t have a turntable yet, but I want to buy it on a Radiohead record so we can put it on a shelf,’” he says.
The percentage is not great, but it does happen.
It's more about the product page than the music.
People come to us and say, "I don't have a gramophone."
These are the younger people, not the older, mature teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for phonograph records, has a much more diverse number of visitors on my arrival.
There are couples in their seventies, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn’t as relaxed as it used to be – from loudspeakers to pulling jazz, the latest pop from Wild Beasts is full of synthesizers and sex, it’s good to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonesome, but the intrusive mental trauma is hard to guess when you’re standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks for a few minutes in the Fopp and watches various record labels at a discount.
She's one of those people who looks at expenses rather than spending feverishly.
According to her, she doesn't make much money, so it doesn't seem like she's collecting record labels.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something like that, but turntables have their charm...," he sighs.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is the store that allegedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I look like I'm very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans, and I'm watching a group of teenage girls cluster around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley recorder.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is covered by phonograph records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of phonograph records.
No one looks at them - perhaps just because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that it is impossible to reach them.
It's just a "vinyl" trick.
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for others, there’s not much to complain about.
It is not surprising that the demographic area, where there is more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where the most money is spent on the most luxurious goods, such as vinyl.
But while, according to my findings, YouGov's results seem to be accurate - at least in record label stores, they don't take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers that actually exist, in record label stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or in offices.
He certainly doesn’t spend Thursday morning wandering around the record shops on Berwick Street, browsing through the recordings, and avoiding the sight of a strange, 30-year-old fake TV moderator hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Green shark is the longest living vertebrates - videoreport<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>
According to scientists, the Green Shark has the longest average lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and measuring five meters.
A court in France has refused to demolish shops in the jungle refugee camp.
A court in France has rejected the Calais authorities’ order to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, Calais authorities objected that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 provisional shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, in provisional restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic meals for several euros.
The prefect’s office in Calais argued that the sites need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they pose fire hazards and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations have said in court that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups do not provide a food supplement for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Disputed temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and food for free to people in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis that would prevent people from operating 72 provisional trades, but said Calais' objections were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role than just serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said that the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was a café in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals, English and French lessons a day, and asylum counselling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the “children’s” café.
The Guardian received a letter saying that the closure of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of them only 8 years old."
Aid Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp has risen to more than 9,000 after a steep rise in arrivals over the summer – the highest ever.
You thought he was dead.
Ul<0xC4><0x8D> squats himself and the volleyball <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
"I have been able to train normally since March," he said at the start of the summer training in full force.
What's the matter with you?
I had bilateral pulmonary embolism, then heart problems.
Because when I was at university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
For two years I had a clot in my calf and I didn't know about it.
It hurt, no one found me.
Then the clot got up.
There is a broken vein in the cage, which will always hurt, especially when the weather changes.
But nothing that would limit me, more an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about life?
He did.
Last year at the summer tournament in D<0xC5><0x99>ev<0xC4><0x9B>nice I did not know that I had an embolism, and I could not move there anymore.
I vomited blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was still five days away completely.
In fact, I thought I was dead in Woodlands, including my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going up.
I know I've got some blood problems, I know I have to be more careful when I'm flying somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Only when I wanted to go back to P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>brami preparation last year, there were still problems with the heart.
It's all right now.
Since March, I have been conditionally preparing myself at home in order to be able to play again.
I'll knock it off. I'm physically better off than I was before.
What do you expect from us?
I'm looking forward to it, the band looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
I hope we sit down humanly to make it fit.
You're lifting the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>?
It had a reputation for snorkeling, but every season is different.
Brno two years ago was the eighth, now the second ended.
There is a new team in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>, there are only a few players left.
It was the last in the extralize, so there's plenty of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first few rounds who's going to be knocked out, we probably won't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He is already experienced and has experienced a lot, he will think of better than the last place.
But my arrival had nothing to do with him, I agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I was a great friend with one and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say a name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came, and I'm glad.
He has a great name, he has been in good clubs, he has been training for many decades, he is a former good player.
He's gonna move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke and I like to get an opportunity in a not so top team.
I was in P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram for two years, but <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a foreigner, the Australian Boehm is already training in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
What does it look like?
I happen to know him, at the university we played against each other in a group.
And a couple of times we had fun there, sometimes we sat together the night after the games, so we already know each other as friends.
We beat them 3-1, I immediately gave it to him at the start of the summer preparation in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to an American, he looks like a nice boy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
Did you contact the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so I'm the one who creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately figured out what kind of player it is, I found it on the internet, how it plays, I saw some videos.
He looked pretty cool, the kid's jumping, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he fits in with us.
How do you look forward to the position of Recorder One?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm twenty-four, and I don't have the guts to turn it around.
I'd rather be in the center of the action, I'd rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I guess I don't want to play anymore if I'm supposed to be like a second recorder and do it full-time.
How many times have you been first?
Half a year in P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram, when it didn't work out for Kust as captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, of which I am an upbringer, I alternated one and two.
It was a great year in the Old Town, after it I had a lot of offers and I chose P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram.
From there, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice wanted me, I stayed, but I did not finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short seat remains the Phelps domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the hymn is sweet as ever," Phelps laughed while his eyes were full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother were again cheering in the audience, this time the son of Boomer was quietly asleep with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started racing and in a few hours it will be all over, he said touchingly.
In the final behind Phelps by almost two seconds behind the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long bench.
Bronze won Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championship.
After Alu Oerter (disc) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to master the same discipline in four games in a row.
After most of the race, Phelps and fellow American Ryan Lochte and home rider Thiago Perreira were at the forefront.
While the gold defender in the final 50s set for a crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the solemn announcement of the bench, he advanced to the final of the race on 100 meters of butterflies.
The legend could not be overshadowed by the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the sign double - after a hundred won in Rio and a double track.
In the final he left behind 37-hundred Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third finished Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While last year's World Championships saw Murphy take only fifth place out of the 200, he became a signage king in Rio.
Larkin was deposed from the imaginary throne, who managed the same double at last year's World Championship.
He won a medal at the Olympics only now.
Penny Oleksiak, a Canadian, and Simone Manuel, an American, shared the gold.
For sixteen-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuela the second after the silver from the relay.
She won swimming gold at OH as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for all those who come after me, the sport will become a love for them and they will get to where I am,” Manuela said.
The third was Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-metre butterfly race in Rio in the world record and still has silver from the crowning two-hundred.
Australian record holder Cate Campbell finished in sixth place.
Japanese woman Rie Kanet won the breaststroke two hundredth, for which it is the first Olympic medal at the age of twenty-seven.
She has no precious metal from the World Championships, her maximum was fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia’s Yulia Yefimova, who, despite her doping past, is struggling with the hostility of viewers and opponents due to the start of the games.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering those questions.
"I'm so tired," said the Russian swimmer.
The right of start in Rio was won by a special panel of CAS sports arbitration just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, let them turn to the arbitral tribunal, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs had a special day.
It wasn't until less than an hour before the match that they found out who they were going against.
They had to deal with tactical preparation.
And then, in an unconventional time, the match began on the small court number one.
The first set did not start well, then they reached the lead of the opponent, but at 19:19 they did not manage to finish.
In the second they were clearly better and equal, but the decisive tie-break did not work out.
Above all, a number of service shows meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermann lamented.
How would you rate the match?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, I lost the income I had gotten used to in the last balloon.
We lost a hundred, which was key.
In the next set we stepped on them with an overview on the pitch, another defense and pressed on the service.
The tie-breaker had badly corrupted submissions, and that's where we picked it up on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could have defeated the Russians.
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: It’s a pity that the start of the first set was missed.
We were able to pull it off, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and in the third decided the service.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and it was about those five, we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the little court number 1?
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: Similar as in China on the side courts.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was an hour at night, complete silence, no music playing, nowhere.
That was the difference from the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose them.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: It was strange.
We started training for the match without knowing the opponents, so we couldn't do the tactical preparation like we did for the other teams.
But Simon (the Nausch angle) prepared his tactics for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers ready, so on this page we were pretty well prepared.
Do you ever think you’d start the game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at 11:30, but not at 12:00.
Block Ruska Birlov<0xC3><0xA1> in the pre-season play-offs at OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Slukov<0xC3><0xA1> and Barbora Hermann in the play-offs at OH in Rio.
Was it annoying?
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: Since we have played the last two matches in the group since ten, we had the regime moved earlier.
This was two more hours.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that another sport has athletes who have to serve their best performance at twelve o’clock.
But I think we prepared as best as we could.
We knew it would be, but it’s not typical and it probably won’t be my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the progress from the group was our goal, it is okay on one side, good.
We did what we said.
But now, after the game, I'm sad.
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: I will get some sleep from it and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big brother's here, the first smearing SIM's coming.
You won't get away with it.
The new rules should apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to obtain a SIM card from one of the local operators during their stay in Thailand.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas, who, for example, work in Thailand or have married there.
The Secretary General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, said there would be no exceptions.
The plan for the sale of SIMs intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator in early August.
The authorities intend to introduce new measures to monitor their location within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security, which will allow to solve the criminal activity committed by foreigners.
The so-called tourist SIM is also intended to help detect people who exceed the allowed length of stay.
Within six months, special SIMs for foreigners should also be available for retailers, along with a SIM exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently switched on for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This feature is not for Thais because we can always easily track them," Tantasith added.
It should be noted that in Thailand prepaid cards are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators distributed a free start-up SIM to tourists at the airports.
They were completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is also being considered by ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia and Singapore.
They also currently have a mandatory SIM registration, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the proposed measure does not imply an obligation for foreigners to acquire a local operator when entering the country of SIM.
They can of course use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country in question know only the relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after logging in to their network.
They know the phone number, but not the owner’s information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so vast that most tourists will begin to look for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities’ efforts to monitor the movement of foreigners have received immediate criticism from foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of privacy protection, the planned system compares it to the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if there is a need to monitor a particular person.
Any abuse of the system will be subject to an unspecified penalty.
"If the service provider monitors the location of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number will not be recycled until after the 90-day period after which the SIM did not sign in to the network, a new one could be recycled after 15 days if it leaves Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a jacuzzi on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the care of the property is taken by the manager.
The condition was enough parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with swinging the floor, high energy efficiency and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern<0xC3><0xAD> apart.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerov<0xC3><0xA1> and her colleague Kamila Pol<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Artiga studio.
Why did you just call them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to everyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to anyone, if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials, and based on the client's wishes they are able to align the interior appropriately.
We collaborated with the architect Lenka Langerova on our mountain apartment, then based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, there was a clear choice for us during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with adequate facilities for a four-member family, conceived as a modern, but not a cool interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with the terraces and to implement intelligent control of the house.
Of course, the quality of the work had to be monitored.
Have you left everything to the experts, or have you yourself interfered with the final form of the interior?
We have approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design has always come from the architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design, and showed some interior elements that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that it was our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vysushil, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav <0xC5><0xA0>p<0xC3><0xA1>la or Otto Gutfreund that helped the architect to orient herself in our taste.
The combination of black, white and walnut wood was also the architect’s idea as well as the individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then verified together by visualization.
Were there any complications in the realization that made you have to give up your original ideas or, conversely, start a new one?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment when it was for the first time possible to climb to the height of our floors, and found that the views we had planned, in fact, shaded the surrounding buildings.
Then we literally changed the disposition overnight from the base.
On the kitchen line and on the lining of the fireplace wall granite was used.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces supplemented by leather, for example on the upholstery of the Norma dining and bar chairs from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make a change or is there something you wish you had differently today?
I believe that this is a modern airy interior, which above all fulfills its purpose.
We are not planning any changes, most of the adjustments after the move took place in the shade and the habitation of the terraces.
Perhaps the only tip is to the floor, when the walnut wood appears to us as too delicate to the house with the dog.
Word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerov<0xC3><0xA1> and MgA. Kamila Hornychov<0xC3><0xA1>, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, therefore it was possible to make a completely new layout solution and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of light conduits in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
This brought daylight to the darker areas of the apartment.
Also, the direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the construction modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to New York?
My parents are of Algerian descent.
I was born in the south of France, just off the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, so I got to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I started to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere between people.
I think that every Frenchman is very negative.
People in France are in a negative mood in general, but lately it has worsened even more.
It is interesting that you mention the negativity.
This is how some people evaluate the Czech nature.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not get it when they come to France because they don’t see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which is enough in my opinion.
Now there is a problem with the behavior of people towards Muslims.
That's totally incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job virtually anywhere else and I came across a vacancy with Air France here in Prague.
I admit that I did not know Prague at all from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I did not know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or insults, but I feel like people are freer here.
That I can do anything, dress anyway, and no one's gonna judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you inconveniently, even if you have special clothes and the like.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think smokers care about that sort of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then a friend and I set up a website where people offer and look for shared housing.
So far we only operate in Prague, but we would like to extend this to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are half Czechs, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say that another specificity of the Czechs is that at first they keep more distance.
He won't let anyone get so close to his body.
That’s a big difference from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on their face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural issue, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it quite simple in Prague, because maybe everyone here speaks English.
Even at dinners or in food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And because everyone can communicate a little bit in English, I don’t have that need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you had any negative reactions as well?
Is it because you are a Muslim?
Well, not really.
Perhaps this is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My manager, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: After all, they are not French, but Africans.
It really touched me a lot.
But if anyone has a problem with being a Muslim, that hasn’t happened to me yet.
And this despite the fact that a colleague once pointed me to some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go to the center, that they would insult me there.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like this could happen in Paris, Nice or Brussels?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that anything can happen anywhere nowadays.
Until recently, I could not have imagined that something like this would happen in France.
This is not just about Muslims.
Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Quran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect themselves with your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even if I shouldn’t feel that way.
I try not to follow the reports of violence very much, but every time I read something, I have a need to apologize for something that is not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>ho z Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad Square.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians protested against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn’t do?
Do you meet with other Muslims in Prague?
My co-workers, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They’re a little more religiously grounded than I am, so we sometimes have a pretty wild discussion of Islam because we all perceive it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, maybe they were studying Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate status of a woman.
How do you feel about that?
I am not submissive in any way.
Quite the opposite.
I am a woman, I have strength.
It’s also because you don’t wear a head covering.
A hijab, for example?
And it's mainly about the way I've been raised.
My mother, for example, is a fundamental Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but does not wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It all depends on how you interpret it.
When one reads the Qur'an, one should make one's own opinion of these things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur’an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the Prophet’s wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the scarves are required, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
Nowhere else did I feel so good.
I’ve been thinking about Poland for a while, but I’m doing great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, protested against the violence.
The wind in Rio blew Kozelskoho Fenclov<0xC3><0xA1> on the boardwalks.
Veronica Kozelské Fenclov<0xC3><0xA1>, a Czech yachtsman, made Friday’s cruises on the Brazilian Riu de Janiero.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved ahead of the final two rides to tenth place.
This would ensure that the Czechs would participate in the final race.
You collect packets like Pokémon.
They want to compete with carriers.
The TV director Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger are behind the idea to use the already planned routes for transporting shipments.
With the idea, they brought three applications with different geographical reach to life.
We launched the national transfer application in May.
At the moment, there are thousands of cities uploaded in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we first want to learn this before we focus more on abroad, says a forty-year-old manager in an interview for iDNES.cz.
How does the Transfer app work and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the data, how big the package you can transfer and how much you want for it.
Someone might ask for a ride that day.
When the route and the delivery time match, it pairs and both come with a mutual notification.
At that moment, the chat will open, where the couple will arrange a transfer.
How many people do you think would have to register in order for each package to always find its courier?
I don’t know the ideal state, I can’t estimate how many registered and how many trips it takes to make the coverage completely optimal and each offer matched the demand.
It is already working on the main tracks and it is logically easier than on the road between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building trust so far and finding that no one escapes with the package.
Haven't you had to deal with a case like this yet?
How many users does the service have after two months of launch?
Right now, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people creating roads.
We see this as a success and we believe that there will be more to come.
Isn't there a risk that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be a competition for large conglomerates only because we are able to deliver the item, for example, on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
For a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
You'll pay a hundred less here, because that's the path someone's already taking.
Should traditional carriers be afraid of a possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope that's the way it is.
The market has huge potential, it feeds huge multinational carriers, as well as business chains where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality does not match what it pays for.
No one wants to find a note in their mailbox that says they have to pick up the shipment at the branch office, not earlier than the day after 7 p.m.
At the time, I needed the package for six hours and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and more functional service that doesn’t bother anyone and sends a signal to the competition that they should try.
Marek Greger (41) and Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka (39).
No one has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a manager of a music club, Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka as a television director.
In 2014, they began to prepare the Shippansee LTD application, which uses the already planned routes between the world's metropolises, mainly by plane, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process the company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or <0xC4><0x8C>SFD.
The programming took three quarters of a year and the application was launched in March 2016.
The P<0xC5><0x99>evez app started development in December last year and was released this year in May.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The Mes<0xC3><0xAD>kem and Mes<0xC3><0xAD>kem Profi have been developed since January this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all these applications, which one day will merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The shared economy has been a topic lately, and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Don't you worry about working in an area that no one can say much about yet, where is the frontier of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It's the same, just a different product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even though someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention to circumvent financial authorities and tax controls.
Every user, whether on one side or the other, will be invited to give their income if they make it their income.
Why do you think the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and the carrier earns, respectively reduces the cost of travel.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
In a time of social networks that divide people, we would like to bring them closer together.
Nice stories can come up, people are happy to help someone, and they will tell each other about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
In my opinion, people have been missing personal access for a long time, about this application we say that it is the service of people to people.
So how do you ensure that the courier with the package does not fly?
Each user of the app, along with the registration, scans the ID card and indicates a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give credibility to the service and the person.
The couriers also collect the stars based on the sender's rating.
We will also offer insurance, details are still being worked out.
The courier is responsible for the uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, but does not accept responsibility for the content according to criminal law, if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If he is stopped by the police and found in a sealed package in his trunk, a slingshot or ten kilos of hashish, the criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
They are registered if necessary by a searchable administrative authority, which as the only one will be able to look into it, even we are not able to see them ourselves, the data are protected against abuse.
How much money will the courier receive after successful delivery of the parcel?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he says.
The sender is charged a few percent extra for mediating the contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push on volume.
Also, no one can accuse the courier of not delivering the shipment when it actually delivered it, the pick-up and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transfer anything.
We have three sizes, small as a butter cube, medium as a plate of eggs and large as a bass beer.
After that, there are no further restrictions and if someone has a place in the car, they will transport the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier sees what is wanted for him.
You don’t even have to pack a thing unless you want to hide the content out loud.
You put the forgotten shirt in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to launch the service?
A friend got the idea more than two years ago, I didn't pay much attention to it then.
Then he showed me a demo of an app with a transnational reach that targets mainly passengers by plane.
At that moment I told him that I would not be looking for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put savings into it.
The next year was a year of development before we founded Shippansee LTD in London to increase the credibility of the entire product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on now.
No, marketing we focused on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch up with the application, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to solve and improve.
We try to respond to feedback from customers and the foreign market is currently not so much addressed.
We know it’s a long-distance run, but we’re not bragging, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way upgrades.
The transfer came about when we thought that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application Mesikem is local, for the city.
But he can send the package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the transfer, but the difference is that as a courier you see the shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
The app for couriers who want to feed on it, we called Mes<0xC3><0xAD>k Profi.
So someone can make a lot of money by picking up packages in the city?
Precisely, the last application will be downloaded in Prague, for example, a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to earn a trip to work.
As much as everyone's messing with those Pokémon right now, they can collect this just the same.
One sees where the orders are in the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and transports the shipment.
It is set cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface, which will be key for companies to send shipments, fill in data about them on the website, or create points on the map.
We are then able to bill them for the use of the service, for example, every month.
Are you currently working on a full-time project?
It takes advantage of us, but we normally have it on the job so that we can support and develop the project.
There is no strong multinational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other incentives and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage with us not the Czech market, but who should go with us in the global product and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be more varied than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based on the concept of network hunting in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to the freedom of movement, which in addition to running also includes the possibility of using a combat titanium.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels focused precisely on agile movement.
They will resemble rigs and include rebuses.
Therefore, double jumps, running on walls and rope slides are essential for overcoming them.
Sometimes it will also be necessary to eliminate the enemies.
There will be no missing maps reminiscent of mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and lower platforms and close large doors.
You will adjust the shape of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should oscillate between furious action and quieter moments to explore an unknown planet.
We're gonna play pedestrian Jack Cooper dreaming of a pilot's career.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper, along with Captain Lastimas, is defeated on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there will be no savagery there.
In addition, Lastimosa is injured in the crash, and Cooper is tasked with commissioning the captain's titan.
His dream of a career as a pilot will come true sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery needed for the robot repair.
Cooper's calls to the Titan will also be significant.
It will serve as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time, with the robot's isolated communication, humorous moments will arise.
For example, when the titanium will dryly list all the injuries that Cooper is at risk in the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was provided by the server Polygon.
In addition, the result will be able to be assessed in two months and Bonusweb will bring you first impressions from the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 will be released on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will come to life, but the original publisher remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and company name.
For example, Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 more games are being created for the publisher, and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, at the time of my retirement, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a twenty-year-old man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first she obviously tried it for a long time, then they put it together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she used to date a guy like that in front of me.
She's gone mad at him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had such a girl, in love with a voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I watched the whole thing.
He then left work regularly at half past four, and so she always left at three to buy.
Every day she tried to see him, at least.
Later, I found out that they were meeting at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got the keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, after all, I always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go there, to take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe that my wife controlled me mentally.
She soon found out that I was controllable, that I was going to do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a puppet.
My neighbors told me that they knew that too.
I was so stupid that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it would affect everyone in the family, only the daughter knew something.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But one day I went to his apartment to get help with something in the laundry room.
He went there with me and I told him that I got anonymous, that he is meeting with my wife and that everything is pointing to it.
I asked him what he would say to me.
He stood there, shrugged his shoulders, looked down, and said nothing.
Then I also met his wife on the way out of the store at the time.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't react to it, and she didn't tell me anything either.
No one told me anything at the time.
I'm the kind of person who's never been around much, who's having trouble getting to know someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I was always hoping that one day it would end.
I thought I'd forgive her for all this, and life would go on.
That's not how it was.
And I've basically never dealt with all of this.
I still have it in me today.
I used to tell her often enough, but in the end I let it go.
He's still living in the next house and I'm still living with her.
It's just that she's more like my wife than my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's busy.
She always tried not to give me any other reason to complain.
And you can say she's good.
But sometimes I want to stroke her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that she loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I'm not tired of that kind of life.
Even when it started and I carried it very badly, I once told her that I did not want to live and asked what she would say to it if I finished it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
After the terrorist attacks, France is escalating the fight against radical Islamists and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"Unless Muslims themselves help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion," Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only the clergy in France are preaching in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where the money often comes from preachers vaccinated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time, it was supposed to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, she was struck by internal contradictions, and it never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Interior and Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevénement, who is known as a proponent of a secular state.
In France, there are about 2,500 mosques and prayer halls, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and a few dozen more are considering this step.
This week, the German police also intervened against the jihadist clergy.
The Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Following the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate broke out in France over a new institution to replace a dysfunctional foundation.
All this has been hastened by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists on behalf of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – ensuring the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also overseeing imams.
However, it is not yet clear where he will receive funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal foods, i.e. meat from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food vendors for granting permission.
A portion of the money would then go into the foundation’s budget.
A contribution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 could also be paid by French pilgrims who travel to Mecca.
Every year about 30,000 of them depart from France for a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, in French mosques, only preachers who have passed the educational programs at the local universities should work.
As a result, their preaching should be consistent with democracy.
The government is also shutting down radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December and more will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"There is no place in France for those who profess hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown gunman on Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Spain's Zaragoza, according to the Independent newspaper.
The shooting took place after the woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping mall, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to arrive for the man in critical condition.
The incident took place around 11:00 a.m. in the central part of the metropolis of the Autonomous Region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish news agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Garnish with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes for light, well digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and have our tastes and our head.
And so from the summer gardens smells grilled cervix, buckwheat, pork colander.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, yet so occasionally except salad or roasted vegetables.
True, grilling is time-saving as well as dishes, in addition, it is a social matter and no one may be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives, how to make good delicacies, which are special dining, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or choke anything for a long time.
They will also contribute to our health.
Whether it is homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a few well-acquainted griffins will suffice to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic treat.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, even more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice is eliminated.
The paper can only be softened in the water for a moment and then it only depends on the imagination of the chef, how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
It's not an algae like an algae.
The advantage of a variety of Asian dishes is that raw materials are already generally available.
Incl. pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies of sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the real pink gari ginger has a unique spicy spicy and at the same time delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it is mixed with several types of vinegar and ginger.
So just buy a bag of the right size, and the attachment with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are especially used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes within a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are very common in many countries in Asia and South America as well as as an "helper" for the preparation of a variety of baked, cooked and fried foods, which are packaged in them in the same way as in alobal.
The banana leaf will then give the dish a specific flavor.
They can be bought in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
However, choose only leaves saturated green, and therefore healthy - uncracked and without stains.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad from wakame algae, sesame and sesame oil.
You can buy it frozen again.
Who eats or prepares sushi often, will probably know especially the algae of the nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by pruning, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - sushi plates.
Wakame - a dark green algae growing in the waters around Hokkaid<0xC3><0xB3> Island - is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the nori algae.
By the way, who would not know miso soup with wakame, allegedly Asian women have been using it since ancient times for postpartum recovery.
And even this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, strengthens the blood circulation, even supposedly prevents graying of the hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and crushed wakame also serve as spices, for example, to flavor rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to soak in water, then rinse, put in boiling water and boil for half a minute.
Then it cools in ice water, cuts out the middle ribs and further adjusts, such as a favorite salad.
However, buying it ready-made, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So it remains only to wrap the roll with easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a longevity bomber.
If you resist and do not throw an extra grilled bun.
Eat healthy, light and summery.
The Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a bit of dexterity, and you have an interesting fresh food that deliciously combines tastes.
And it's done once or twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green asparagus, 60 g of lettuce cucumber, 60 g of wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chili sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of gari ginger, some pine nuts.
Let's get the screws ready first.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to soften.
Meanwhile, in hot water, briefly boil the asparagus shoots, after about three minutes, let them quickly cool in ice water, so that they do not lose color.
Place a vegetable filler on the allowed paper and wrap.
Prepare the filling from white radishes, carrots and lettuce, cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
Place the asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add the threads and at the end decorate the whole dish with wakame algae, pickled ginger, a slice of mango, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-point rugby, Fiji picks gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in seven-point rugby finished with a devastating lead on the final hurdle, with Fiji defeating the British in the final match on Thursday night at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio at a 43-7 high.
The Fijians have taught a master class in processing, landfill, debris, supporting game, line running, and brutal forces – and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unprecedented price of comfort in the form of a silver medal – for Britain the third on a given day – and the British could have been proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic Sevens rugby tournament, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and the South African Republic.
A win over South Africans 7:5 in the semi-finals on the same day may have frozen in the final.
Fiji, in its form, would also defeat a 15-member team in full health.
While writing this will not be a comfort to the British, they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon, is Fiji’s head coach.
Great Britain is off the beaten path.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, the Adelaide Sevens lost every game.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji started out splendidly, reflecting the British’s breakthroughs for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his other teammates, it was like running behind a number of buses in motion, and the World Cup champions led 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain hardly touched the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring a third time, but only Fiji slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw the touchdown in the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after his return and there was still more than 1 minute left on the clock... from the first half.
V<0xC3><0xA1>temo Ravov<0xC3><0xA1> then penetrated through the tiny British and clung to the line where he scored.
The conversion to 29:0 was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji was born for the 7s rugby, while the British were still learning handover.
That's the way it is.
After halftime, the British made massive changes and stopped the Fijan attack... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after the brilliant Fiji interplay Joshua Tuisov penetrated further.
Dan Norton tried to get the opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown in the left corner to raise an 36:7. But the match had long been won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and their fans sang, waved flags and danced.
It was difficult not to admire the completely joyful approach of the Fijans.
In the final moments, however, Mata Villamé again attempted to subdue the victory of the Fijans.
There was a whistle, the Fijians hugged and the British fell on the lawn completely hidden.
The same day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals and the United Kingdom defeated South Africa in the close semi-finals - the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored under the hook in the second half.
The great late dump of Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from England's fifteenth team, secured the win - and eventually the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing race inspired the fight of the coach with cancer
You won’t find more emotional gold at these Games – and that’s what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punitive exhalations in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two, there were three voices in the ship. When the ship whistled down the surface to meet the second Olympic gold in a row in the women's pairs race, the voice of coach Robin Williams was still present in the ship. They are the first women in the history of British sport, so
Their dominance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained undefeated.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying along the water's surface with the elegance of a swan - does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every gold medal in rowing, there is a battalion of auxiliary hands that make a difference bit by bit, and no hands were any more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer that can be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It will change your view of the matter a bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The lucky thing for the whole trio was that they could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, and thus reduce the failure to a minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to cope with his own turmoil.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment that is on a mission to Aghanistan, said: "I was at the bottom of my emotions this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
It underscores how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked together and Robin have worked together.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
“Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anyone, so he has a huge thank you, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have asked for a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair set an astonishing rhythm that their rivals could not cope with.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were focused at the most moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we did not strive to achieve something famous.
We weren’t looking forward to today’s fireworks, we just wanted to hang out well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple takes a year to think before they decide what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, with TV adventurous Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it would be my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it," she said.

Jail?
Rather let them drive people for free, says the cabbie hunter Rube<0xC5><0xA1> to a groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate official in Prague are, according to <0xC4><0x8C>T, accused.
You have made a series of reports in which you have revealed fraudulent practices even to those who are to be in a group that will be brought before the court.
You've faced a couple of nasty fights with the uncovered actors.
How powerful is the report on the indictment of members of the organized group for you?
I was expecting some kind of trial to take place.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in jail.
It's useless.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them so that they'll carry all the people for free.
That's a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean that you do not see the punishment as effective enough?
For me, it is enough that some of them are so afraid that they are no longer doing the work.
For example, one makes a pingela, another distributes a pizza, and one has completely hated it.
The defendants could theoretically be sentenced to two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
Generally, I have a problem with deprivation of liberty.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in such a case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the company they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they've been doing this by destroying our country's name and robbing people.
So let them make a good business card right now and give people a free ride.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a public benefit.
As someone goes to collect waste, they would get a car and free people would drive around Prague.
No, I really think they'll get a probation in the end, and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek and then at the Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Bati University in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
It belongs to people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of shows, is now preparing the program Prague Guide, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
Rube<0xC5><0xA1> advises them in the form of short reports which services in Prague they prefer to avoid and which they recommend to use without fear.
Previously, he filmed a series with the titles How to, City of Cheats?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Prague.
In the prosecution, they are referred to as an organized group.
The police followed her for several months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be classified as mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from the Mother.
It's more about mobsters - juniors, but they're organized for sure.
The only thing that matters is that they watch each other's staff (taxi station).
The whole of Prague is divided.
I noticed that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Vary (disco club)
Everyone just keeps an eye on their place, and each group is sort of organized.
It seems to be a network.
However, only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate official were charged, who warned the driver of the checks.
As you yourself say, the undesirable phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
So what percentage of Prague taxi fraudsters in the taxi service, according to your estimate, is involved?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still there.
I'm talking about Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Ryj<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic bumper in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at Charles Bridge and drives people.
The last time I went with him, he wanted seven hundred for three miles.
His police did not stop for some reason.
They only picked a few people from the whole big group.
The same is true in other parts of Prague.
With the indictment of seven people, it is therefore difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague filth, which apparently has much larger dimensions.
Of course, it's completely useless.
It will help, but all evil will not be washed away, that is true.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still perform in the same places that you showed in the reports, that is, at Charles Bridge or in Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations, they stand every day and violate ordinances every day.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's not even cats anymore, but complete indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even if they are only part of the group, will be brought to trial.
It's a breakthrough.
So I have to ask, do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even though I feel like I need to do a little better, I will continue to do so.
It is necessary to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to get rid of him.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But that’s not the case, of course there are more.
You're still trying to confront them right in the cabs?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it’s still bad.
Just last week I caught a taxi driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he then claimed it was 56 crowns (he used a decimal-stamp trick).
He had a receipt for it, the cops came, and this cabbie was so daring that he still went to the cops and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
A taxi driver on a taximeter pasted a decimal point and robbed tourists of 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the audacity of fraudulent taxi drivers did not subside even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who charged unreasonable amounts for a short drive?
Their audacity is still unbelievable.
How'd it go with the taxi driver who was claiming 56 kronor?
The police sent him away with the fact that they could not discuss with him on the spot because he issued a receipt.
And that will be, I think, a problem for the court as well (six taxi drivers and one ex-employee).
On one side there's a taxi driver with his receipts, on the other side there's the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate may not use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming a piece about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves pointed me to this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage only for reporting.
Are you concerned that this fact could protect them even in court?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver would be able to drive for six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he would not live on it.
You were talking about a decimal-stamp trick that underwater taxi drivers put in front of foreign clients.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they afraid to continue using this fiddle after your reports are published?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the show, on the contrary.
I recently went with a taxi driver, bragging in front of me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that a black cardboard was glued to the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what it was, he said, "You know what it is."
If fines were not too effective for taxi drivers, can the court and their colleagues be wary of them?
Is there anything that can deter them from cheating?
You talked about how you think they'll always find a way to cheat.
I don't think there's anything to discourage them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight more to get them out of there seriously.
From my experience, I must say that these fair taxi drivers in Prague fortunately prevail.
Do they have a desire to go against those who ruin the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack the mind.
He can't walk around and he can't say exactly what they want.
When they staged the demonstration (due to the proposal for a general restriction coming from the office of the mayor Adriana Krn<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>), it was not very clear what they really wanted.
They once said they weren’t protesting Uber, they just wanted the same conditions as Uber, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and only the best possible advertising for Uber came out of it.
How do you assess the approach of the Prague Magistrate in solving the problem of overpriced fare?
It is clear that the criminal police had to go into it in order to solve something.
The magistrate was short on that.
They had a mole that was carrying out the information, which means that the taxi department was doing its job for several years completely unnecessary.
I hope that this official will be charged with all the tainted checks until the last check to make him aware of what he's done.
I think that's the worst part.
I was even with him on one check ride, which I only found out later from their schedule.
It has been a few months since the last episodes of the series were published.
What's the response?
I think especially with foreign viewers, what the series is most focused on.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I give them the videos.
And then when we walk through Old Town Square, they are surprised that the same people who are seen in the footage are really standing there.
The notorious Prague celebrities.
Oh, really.
I'd put a raft around them so people could look at them.
Museum of Communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need it?
Oh, yeah.
I travel with services for which I do not have to pay in cash, but by card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many disciplines that are fair.
I've only taken a taxi on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting in the car, "Well, you have the courage."
I'm dressed as an Italian tourist.
There have been reports of fraudulent taxi drivers since 2005.
The former mayor Pavel Bém that same year went on a check ride in disguise as an Italian tourist and immediately on the first try the driver dressed him up by two hundred.
But the editor Rube<0xC5><0xA1> had worse experiences.
Taxi drivers charged him 820 crowns for driving from Old Town to Wenceslas Square, which is about 195 crowns per kilometre, according to the authors of the reports.
The Prague Magistrate has set a maximum price of CZK 28 per kilometre.
In the filmed reportage there are also other surprising sums: for example, the two-kilometre road from Parissk<0xC3><0xA1> street to Truhl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xA1> cost a tourist 400 CZK.
The expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For a drive to the Angel, which has 2.5 kilometers, they charge six hundred crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
Dirt from it goes well, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be ripped out of the folds.
It is not easy and it is not fast, the restaurateur Vanesa Trostov<0xC3><0xA1> from Old<0xC5><0x99>ichov in H<0xC3><0xA1>j<0xC3><0xAD> approached her work.
Hat down in front of it: the tombstone is lined with scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb and climb again countless times.
"The restaurateur should be careful, patient and unpretentious to the working environment," she said.
This is by no means the first restoration work in Frydlantsk.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the rear section of the town hall of Frydlant were restored, as well as the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Z<0xC3><0xA1>ti<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>, St. John of Nepomuk in Frydlant, Piet in Frydlant County Street, the Marian Column in Frydlant.
The restoration of the tomb of Melchior, Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof and Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina z Redern began in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the application of impurities and crust, the loosened stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; they will either anchor to the wall or to each other.
They are also waiting for treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gold again.
"Then the inscriptions on the marble slabs will begin to be gilded with pure gold plates," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1>, the State Monumental Care of the City Office in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant.
There are no records from the past that the tombstone has undergone any repairs.
At a closer look, they will capture the holes drilled in the marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of the tombstone.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
The grave was literally eye-catching, said Saturday.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross there are restaurateurs with a slight exaggeration as at home.
After the 2010 flood, it was necessary to put in order the tombstones that were under water, the baptismal font was restored, the murals in the tomb and now the tombstone.
"We would like to go to the stained glass windows in the future too," said Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restoration work on the restoration of the redernov tombstone will come to a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They will be paid from subsidies, the city will not deposit any of their money into this part of the reconstruction.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from winning in the regional round of the Historic City of 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, the mayor of Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant Dan Ramzer specified.
The release of the prize for the restoration of the tombstone was decided by the representative.
Opinions of experts on the future development in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) within one month and a half year.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which went through 12% of corrections in February, is now at a new historic high and has already posted 7% since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interest of central banks in the long run, which in the end have always achieved theirs.
In a situation where U.S. stocks are at an all-time high, volatility is once again disappearing, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown with satisfaction and without fear due to the quantitative release of the U.S. central bank and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) has remained stable below the 12 percent limit.
And don't.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing and the Bank of England, which will buy <0xC2><0xA3>70bn of bonds in the next six months, has also joined the stock last week.
The new wave of quantitative easing therefore pushes already so low yields even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That is, of course, a million-dollar question.
But there are currently no risks, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market is stabilizing and in China, and Brexit is basically no longer an issue, so we shouldn’t be too surprised if, in a similarly calm regime, the U.S. is also holding on to the stock market.
It's a pity that Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, said the head of the European Commission, Juncker, when the French politician (truly experienced, because he was so permeated by a variety of supranational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to find from the main)
Juncker’s choice has given rise to hope that it is in the EU’s serious interest to seek a form of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most British media have accepted Barnier’s name as Juncker’s act of war.
Barnier is a European rock federalist.
He hates Great Britain.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of the reform of European banking law.
He grasped it as only he could grasp it: the hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon conception of the free market and the model of capitalism.
A proponent of multilateral regulations, he co-authored the concept of the so-called banking union and, in resentment of everything that comes from the City financial centre in London, he enacted legislation on the excessively harsh regulations of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, unbreakable and apparently ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How not to remember in this context the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak federation, to which the balance, overview and empathy of Prime Minister V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus contributed so much.
Even today, Czechs and Slovaks can be close friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus - at least in this -.
It would be for everyone's good!
Earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin released his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
The Russian media reported this with reference to the press service of the Kremlin.
Putin suggested that Ivanova would be fired at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by Rossija 24, the president said he was responding to Ivanov's wish when he took office that he would be head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report of the exchange at the head of the presidential administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's current representative Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63, has been described as one of Putin’s closest associates.
This former KGB officer, for example, served as Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister in the past.
He is also leaving the chair of the president’s security council.
However, Ivanov said during a meeting with Putin that the length of time he spent at the head of the administration of the head of state is actually a record-setting figure.
He lived there for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since her establishment, 11 people have already been replaced in this function.
Kvitov<0xC3><0xA1> and Deblistov<0xC3><0xA1> will not play the final with <0xC5><0xA0>af<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
So far, none of Friday's tennis matches have turned into a final.
Petra Kvitov<0xC3><0xA1> was the first to lose her fight, which was subdued by the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, Kvitov<0xC3><0xA1> was followed by the Czech deblists <0xC5><0xA0>af<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>iv<0xC3><0xA1> and St<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xBD>cov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The Williams sisters' victories in the first set came after winning, but they lost two sets and the Russians eventually took advantage of the set in a shortened game.
The second set then lost in a 4-6 ratio.
Half the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skier Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Synek won his semi-finals with an overview, when he defeated the second Damir Martin from Croatia, despite being released in the end almost a second.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, the son said.
It was his opponents who, unlike him, had to fight for progress.
So it took some strength off them, which could make it easier tomorrow.
“But I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, it’s just playing cards for me,” said Dukly, a rower from Prague.
But Mirka Topinkov<0xC3><0xA1>-Knapkov<0xC3><0xA1> did not walk in Snyk’s footsteps.
The thirty-five-year-old rower took fourth place in today's semi-final in her ride and on Saturday she will start in the B final and fight for 7th to 12th place.
They don't defend London gold like that.
For the first time, I didn’t make it to the finals.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I drove a good race and I put everything I could into it.
The opponents were simply better, Topinkov<0xC3><0xA1> Knapkov<0xC3><0xA1> bowed before them.
She fought until the end and believed that in her fourth game she would be among the elite six.
He gave up the fight just in front of the target.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could step out of this field.
I was surprised that a Chinese woman had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it to the final through the Austrian.
"Unfortunately, today was a life race," she told the 2011 World Champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained a young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who did not manage to break out of the qualifying for the second time, this time in the pits.
In it, Nepejchal took 33rd place.
The qualification was the best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points from the first division, and Kirill Grigoryan (628,9).
Nepejchal's score was 620.5 points.
For the first time, athletes also spoke to the program in Rio, including Czech seven-man Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachov<0xC3><0xA1> and Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klucinov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Cachov<0xC3><0xA1> ranks eleventh after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech record-breaker Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klucinov<0xC3><0xA1> is twenty-two.
British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimetres, as did the second Belgian Nafissata Thiam.
They both took care of the historically best scoring performance in the seven-match series.
They tried to jump another 201 centimeters, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Apart from the absurdity of the question posed in this way: German society has undergone profound self-reflection, while Russian society has not.
In both great Eurasian nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century, and regimes came to power that were inhumane, brutal, and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of Communism mentioned in the Black Book of Communism, whether they were daily individual repressions, targeted famines, incompetent warfare or inhumane experiments.
The Nazis wiped out about 6 million Jews in an inhumane way, and the total victims of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, atrocities were carried out by the Germans and the Soviets.
In Germany and in the USSR it was not just a few individuals who were guilty, but a large part of the people took part in these crimes, whether actively, passively or simply by cowardice or by putting their heads in the sand.
It’s not just the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are equally guilty.
In Germany immediately after the end of the war came denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: “Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?”
How could you!
This has brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often na<0xC3><0xAF>vely idealistic) goals, but it’s definitely not about rejoining Alsace-Lothringen or attacking someone militarily for revenge.
After the defeat of the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the turn of the millennium when the former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
The criminal past is often celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin's Russia is revenge, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity, and future of one’s own people is of no value to the top.
By their own, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior – predestined to Asian (self) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from the rising tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has worsened.
Who is benefiting from rising tensions?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia deteriorated again.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side was the peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports on both sides of the conflict are contradictory and difficult to independently verify, so we can only think of the old question that is familiar to us.
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea by the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, blames the Kremlin for provocation.
Information about the arrest of members of the Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia has already come from the case of the pilot Savchenko known answer that they were allegedly abducted on the territory of Russia.
If we were to accede to the Ukrainian version, what would benefit Russia from worsening the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: in nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only hurt Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further tightening sanctions and strengthening the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, against the backdrop of the immigration crisis in Europe, attention has declined from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost all credit to its citizens, when the current support of President Poroshenko is around 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have been bankrupt long ago without generous financial injections from the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime once again needs to draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces want to show themselves again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It remains to be hoped that all those who are trying to unleash an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but all ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria has shown inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero since October last year when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 vs. December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 vs. July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in travel for the following consumer goods groups in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
U.S. intelligence agencies have been monitoring Russian hacking for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks was made public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was dealing with the attack on the servers of the Democratic Party headquarters.
However, there is no official report on Russia’s involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied any involvement in the attack.
The report on monitoring the alleged Russian attack was highly classified because it would reveal that the US intelligence services are monitoring the hacker attack and could also reveal the way they do it and what resources they use.
The attack was reportedly carried out by two Russian intelligence services.
The New Cyber Security Advisory Board
The Russian trace tracking material was encrypted and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters reported.
Only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called Gang Eight in the U.S., was informed of public officials.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the presidents of the Democrats in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the defense and security committees of Congress.
Democratic Party chief Donna Brazile announced on Thursday that she is setting up a cybersecurity advisory board to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of Democratic Party servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in smoked salmon from Alberto.
The chain apologised.
On the basis of the consumer's stimulus for health problems after consuming food Wild smoked salmon - pieces of 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016, the Prague hygiene department carried out an inspection in the Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na M<0xC5><0xAF>stku.
The inspection found that the batch L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer informed, is no longer available, and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was removed.
Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
This is dangerous for humans - the larvae in the body cavity or the muscles of the fish are a strong allergen and the larvae eaten by humans can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, Sticha said.
We apologise to our customers for any problems with this branded product.
We have immediately withdrawn the said batch from the sale and for preventive reasons we have also withdrawn all other batches of this item.
There was a mistake on the part of the supplier we are negotiating with, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, Alberto Barbora Vanko, a spokesman for the company, told News.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it in any of the stores of the chain and get the money back.
The larvae will destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Vr<0xC5><0x88>ata.
The hygienists informed the Prague and Central Bohemian veterinary administration about the occurrence of the dangerous product.
According to the server sepecnostpodavin.cz, people after consuming the parasite can get anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can proceed without symptoms, said the <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Symptoms appear an hour to two weeks after consuming insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
Three weeks after the onset of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both high and low temperatures, which is why they are killed either by sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or by freezing it.
Veterinarians currently inspected the salmon at the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had parasites in them.
The shipment of 1700 products arrived in the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Expedited, for the most part into the Ahold chain, there have been 919 packages to date.
Unsold stocks of the product are currently being withdrawn from stores, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal said on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples banned sending other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman wanted to escape from Raqqa, apparently killed by a Russian raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to a jihadist who was soon killed, sobriety came.
The caliphate’s expected paradise for British girls turned into hell on earth from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She phoned her back to Britain repeatedly and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They are ordered to shoot without hesitation, quotes The Telegraph lawyer of the family of the deceased girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last traces led to Rakka, from there the girl spoke for the last time.
Then there was a report of her death, but it could not be verified.
Her family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
They discussed together how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet the former student again.
Kadiz, however, was probably killed before she could escape because the house in which she was staying was aligned with the ground raid in May, the British ITV News reported.
Television said the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that attacked the ISIS garden in Syria.
You would wear blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a lawyer for the family.
In a week when Kadiza was considering fleeing Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was arrested in an attempt to escape and, according to available information, was publicly killed.
I think [Kadiza] interpreted it as a warning and decided not to take any risks, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and 15-year-old school friends Shamya Begum and Amira Abas went on a trip on February 17 last year.
All they said at home was that they were going out.
However, they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there via Turkey to IS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl's family did everything in their power to get Kadizu back.
You'd wear blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything they could to make sure she got her daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught on their own, the lawyer added.
The only positive thing, he said, is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are being fooled by Islamist propaganda.
“There are many cases where people have gone there, realized how things are there, understood how different it is from the Islamic State’s propaganda promises, and wanted to go back,” Akunjee said.
The fate of Cadiz's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also remained silent, their families must reconcile with the fact that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the county center and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
From the middle of the 18th century, courts were held in the town hall and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts lived were sad, and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them even successfully.
Therefore, city officials decided to move the premises of the prison to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more friendly to the prisoners, had heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it was not in operation for a long time, it was closed by the end of August 1889 for economic reasons, since smaller corrective devices were expensive to operate and did not pay too much.
The stories of the prisoners and the hunt for ghosts.
For the public, the prison opened a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different conditions prevailed in them.
Guides in contemporary costumes further enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was the breaking of fingers or the burning of marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked in one of the cells, mostly for a photo at a memorial, or to instruct themselves in the feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray Prison is one of the most famous places in Scotland, where it is supposedly scary.
Several groups of paranormal activity hunters have already gone there, and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt some ghosts.
That night, of course, will cost <0xC2><0xA3>300, which is about CZK 9,500.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, the surrounding scenery and history.
"Anime" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app allows about 150 million users every day to change reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a character that seems to come out of the picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies every day.
Any errors will be published immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past earned criticism with accusations that the app promotes blackfacing or that it supports white skin tones as an ideal beauty.
So when it offered users a filter this week that made them have sloping eyes, curved teeth, and swollen faces, some critics called it a racist Asian caricature — “yellowface.”
And they asked whether these repeated controversial questions do not point to a larger problem in society – the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and outrage spread quickly, and Snapchat said the next day it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an expression of accounts to the characters of the anime, not as a caricature of the Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded them of painful stereotypes in action.
The others, without packaging, refused to compare with the anime.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added, “It’s hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian caricature and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face, but that the yellow face is drawn to the despicable extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
American culture seems to have a never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Holywood and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diversified than their older partners — can mean that you can expect even greater sensitivity.
“When a single Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to a user,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday, “it’s very hard to get around these things today without noticing it as it used to be.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she is convinced that racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in recruiting Snapchat employees.
Katie Zhu criticized the predominantly white, all-male leadership of the company and ended the article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that there’s no diversity between employees and colored people at the time these things are decided,” said Zhu, who has Chinese-American origins, “or that colored people are working there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to talk to.”
Other observers share her view — a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees with the fact that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origins of its employees, but the company said it had recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and internal management of inclusion.
Zhu added, “I’m curious if they really need more users like that who can say it’s not okay,” with their account being cancelled.
Military Officers Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Says Parliamentary Committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report released Thursday that officers from the U.S. Central Command had altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events from the country provided.
According to a preliminary report by the Republican Chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Subcommittee on Defense, a “large dissatisfaction” among central intelligence analysts was found, according to which their superiors altered their assessment of the U.S. effort.
The Central Headquarters, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release to the report reads: “The intelligence reports approved by senior Centcom officers usually offered a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than were confirmed by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other sources.”
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable — our fighters are hurt when misanalysis is presented to senior policymakers,” said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
The failure of Centcom's leadership reaches to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the persistent problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing U.S. efforts in training Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that the Obama administration’s top officials ordered the reports to be amended, the report says analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by Islamic State.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Staff’s press releases, statements and congressional statements were significantly more positive than what the events actually were,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"This is clear after months of investigation," said Mike Pompeo, a Republican representative from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top-ranking U.S. Central Intelligence Agency staff manipulated the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency’s outputs in order to downplay the dangers of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a task force after they learned of analysts' concerns that intelligence services' information about the Islamic State were being manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, further investigations must follow.
Centcom’s intelligence services are still under investigation by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Committee on Intelligence released their own findings on Thursday, which matched some of the findings of the Republican working group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling assessments of information about ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the committee and a representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process "led to distort intelligence outputs," damaged morale among analysts, and "insufficiently taken into account dissenting views."
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House is trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their findings based on “the premise or the political situation.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon inspector general, which was launched following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Ministry would not comment on the parliamentary report as the Inspector General’s investigation was still ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these crucial issues of national security.”
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a verdict that now declares a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year’s indictment raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Criticism of the Islamic State report has been a reflection of conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - has been defending a small unit in Iraq for years.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the Islamic State’s intelligence services.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that despite public statements of the contrary, the airstrikes against Islamic State refineries had not significantly weakened the financial resources of this terrorist group, as the group had built a temporary refinery for the oil and gas industry.
The Times reported in September that the findings, however, were not passed on outside the central headquarters.
The Centcom commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers found Senate testimony too positive a rating of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States won ground hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will be a decisive match in the team of Great Britain
Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 victory against Japan, and just a day later, for the US women's field hockey team, she scored the first two goals of the match, in which the US defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a memorable success, but Bam (27) said she wasn't sure if she had ever done that.
"I don't know," she said.
I'm not one of those people who writes down their goals.
But this is what he knows: The Americans in the Olympic tournament lead the game 4-0 and share the first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained undefeated on Thursday after defeating Japan 2-0.
The United Kingdom and the United States will face each other in their last match of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide which of the six teams will finish in the first and which in the second place.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes who are at the head of the second group for a little longer.
No matter how the game ends on Saturday, the Americans have caused a stir here with their surprising ride, four years after they finished between 12 teams at the games in London.
Bam was on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took land hockey for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
The 2008 Olympics were missed because they didn't make it to the finals.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team did much.
The following year, English coach Craig Parnham was appointed and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” said Bam.
We did not have the pace of work in London that we have today.
We made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bamov<0xC3><0xA1> started in the first half by shooting a goal known from close up.
India entered the match without a tournament victory, but the team proved surprisingly tough and maintained a 1:0 score until the third quarter ended when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then crawled into the middle and shot the ball into the goal to get the American in the lead 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the fourth quarter.
The elimination of American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three wins, was the first in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, "but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampoline in the middle of Olympic rage
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro is to feel a persistent, indescribable and passionate alternation of competitiveness and effort.
It’s like the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay stick, which is handed over from a swimmer, gymnast, and triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the papers, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in a café queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming sweetheart of women with cheekbones, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be heard in households in the main broadcast time between the ad and sponsor spots if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumping.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine the same on all competitions.
Away from the center, a little in the shadows are sports that are not widely recognized: shooting from air guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always be successful in the classic swimming style - and will probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me point out the subtle charm of the trampoline.
Even though trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first featured at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of interventions, this sport remains almost unnoticed - many people I've been questioning didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and by 2012, none of the athletes had even reached the final.
Prices in the men's category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the London gold medals will include Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
However, jumping on a trampoline has another misfortune, partly because the uninitiated ear will seem to be more suited to the clown university than to the Olympics.
I have to admit that I am not an expert, but just an enthusiast watching from the country.
It has comedic potential - comic vibrations of infinite reflection - but also the delicacy of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines in itself.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n", which means "jumpboard."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of almost 10 meters and perform sets with several elements (salt, screws and combinations) before finally landing again on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to their performance, difficulty and "time in the air".
Twenty-three athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
The gold medal fighters have to go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
It tries to catch up not only to the target band or the starting wall, but as the television news reports, also another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical – and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it’s a bit exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on a trampoline brings relief in this regard.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is up.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a weightless state like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, no difficulty, but for the duration of the team, there is no fierce fight to achieve the goal, no measuring distance, but only the perfect, gentle provision of time and gravity.
This is the closest the Olympics and Zen are ever to come.
The women’s qualification and finals are held on Friday afternoon, at 13 o’clock Eastern Time, and the men’s competitions are held on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of the afternoon block, which starts at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you will probably miss despite the other matches.
And if the only way to get attention is for male athletes to be the subject of passionate views and materialization – as recently suggested by U.S. gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch his breath.
“Protestant Generations” in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during clashes with police.
Is there a threat of war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been gripped by anti-government unrest, which has spread to more and more areas.
Thousands of people have taken to the streets in the last week alone, demanding fundamental political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was relentless.
Witnesses say police officers shot and killed crowds of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage of the protests, likely from late last year or early this year, captures security forces beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand by the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the dangers of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few of the African countries, if any, are getting such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization that fights for human rights without ceasing to talk about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many of them have been expelled, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But that can change.
“When you strangle people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
It has been protesting for a generation.
There are many complaints and they concern everything from land disputes to absolute control of the ruling coalition.
After last year’s widely criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies have won the last chair held by the opposition and now control 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing, and the conflict along this inaccurate, controversial border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitists fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past few years, such as the Orom Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of simmering beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have rekindled.
The first one is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks only in the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and Internet services have improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered at the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oroms and the Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Orom and Amhar are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and commerce, and used the Oroms, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on our way to a unified leadership," said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of Orom.
The largest protests took place in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an unspecified disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly masterful in detecting initial signals of dissatisfaction and used ambassadors to process and win over opponents.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say they have no confidence in security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
Ethiopia last experienced such turmoil in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts called an election that the government robbed and then stole.
It was followed by a hard hit, during which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped it.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation taking place.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked Tigris-owned businesses, and resentment against the Tigris on social media is becoming more and more common.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies at odds.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone overflights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently said the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, at the same time it does not want its allies to break up in an already volatile region.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement on Obama and funding ISIS as “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to downplay the latest controversy that is flooding his campaign, saying he didn’t mean it seriously when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about a Republican presidential candidate’s ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an uncomfortable situation, who worked hard to defend him in turbulent times, and must explain that he may not have meant his remarks seriously.
Following this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in talks that he did not actually intend to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
In a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the old one’s claim just one day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remark by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy ISIS, the Republican nominee did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes as Trump has tried to focus his campaign’s attention on the economy as his preferences in election polls decline.
Trump and Clinton took part in an economics duel in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the issue.
He again warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals were linked to tax increases, and said her speech was said to be boring.
Trump has used sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he received a wave of criticism, when he suggested that the Russians should infiltrate Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remark with the words: “I am, of course, sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and mitigate them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing the extent to which some messages have a response from his supporters to find out how they respond, and then one way or another, according to the response, he “gives an explanation,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that he is handy in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be explained in different ways.
As the results of the polls continue to fall in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more skewed tone in recent days, rather than softening things up for the general public.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll published on Friday showed that Tump is far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and very close to her in Florida.
Trump even tries to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he makes, but often blames his critics for misinterpretations of his words or misunderstood his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters, who must stand by him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks are, into an unpleasant situation.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is a legitimate political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost an unknown, small organization, which he mistakenly called a newcomer, and it was because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to collapse and fail to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s gatherings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to fire the media around him on Twitter for exaggerating his every word and being intrigued by it.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” TV scholars trying to understand him and said, “They can’t do that!”
Several Democrats have apologised to Trump by saying that this is just another proof that he is not eligible for the presidency.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the price market. Now it is back in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a tricky place in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, no Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soap in the form of cakes.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is looted and the Verbs are now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
The coffee is still good, too.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original cafe, who is both the owner and CEO of the new location.
In Verb he began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his clients offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same pastry supplier and bought the same model of the espresso machine.
He even used the illumination from the old Verb again.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
There are sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You will also find bowls with brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of natives.
"A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of prices," he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and frequented the Verb Cafe.
It happened even when the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I found that what I like is coffee and culture in Verb,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but that day she gave herself a mixed chai, another novelty, instead of her usual iced coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
He goes to work and always orders the same thing.
"At 4:00 every day, like a clock, I'm coming here and they're making me a sandwich with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he lets himself put bacon, eggs and ham on his ham ham ham.
Rodriguez said he had no regrets about the soap shop taking his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the cafe as an additive.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also received the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon exhibit it, so that his new neighbors would feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juice manufacturer wants to roll into bottles and sell filtered coffee.
It offers the possibility to expand the café into a neighboring building.
A lot of customers just need to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe reopens, going in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and ate lunch.
President Roosevelt enjoyed a selection of 5th Avenue dishes, such as goose liver pastry and Maryland tortoise soup.
But his menu for that day was more modest: eggs in a devilish way in paradise sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert plum pudding.
“It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, “It was also a message to Americans how to eat.”
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, is dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe’s last book, “Chop Suey,” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane’s book, “97 Orchard,” tells the life story of a residential home on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work “A Square Meal,” which Harper will release on Tuesday, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed their own cooking solidarity and met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small, strict buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis in 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) ordered turkey, potato mash and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbamate, which the couple said was perfect for talking about food during the crisis.
"Carbanats were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
Peanut, liver and bean carbanate were sold.
They were made from that mixture and other cheap foods that set the ingredients.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe sneered.
"They'd lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of food you eat.
Teams of women cooked for the farm workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner, freshly baked cake was served.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" looks at how the nation was coping with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, fearful point for the American people,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally feared: mysterious dishes such as carbanats and casseroles spread, casseroles as “an amazing way to use the remains,” Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unaesthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - after many years the central point of American food - has become a cost-effectively allocated luxury.
The strange mixtures, which were supposed to serve as a calorie and nutritional supplement, were preferred to taste or even common sense when cooking.
During surveys for a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a time-honored meal from a baked onion filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the evening table," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman said: “It was surreal.
Peanut butter with baked onion does not go together.
It was typical for many homemade recipes.
As never before and never since, domestic economists—among them Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943—managed the country’s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take over the burdens of the budget, and turned patties like cream spaghetti with carrots into tasty meals.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical feasts.
First of all, the pastries were created in response to the government's hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's pose "I'll give myself a cake".
While publicly praising the simple Iowan farm kitchen of his childhood, he ate as the chosen millionaire he became.
“He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce,” said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not made him go by example on his own stomach.
As the book tells, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in taste at all, leading the White House to “not only serve almost the most filthy food in all of Washington, but also the most uneasy way prepared.”
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis echoed as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy has remained in our constant study of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
The couple said they had a better understanding of Ms. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits during the writing of the book — perhaps why she couldn’t throw away the food.
“She was really afraid of wasting food,” said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled, "People were bad at it."
There was an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg had clean tables, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly stole a spoonful of dense brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a proper landlord, he said to his wife, "It would be good to have a little chopped curls."
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees who come to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians are making fun of themselves.
That's what a series would look like if we did it.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us are making fun of their home country.
With the help of Photoshop, he creates collages that funnyly show what it would look like if famous series and films were shot in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the cost of legal representation in the case of a type C jaundice patent against Merck
A district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of fees incurred by Gilead Sciences Inc in the case of a type C jaundice patent against a drug manufacturer at Merck & Co Inc.
In June, a ruling was overturned that Gilead had to pay $200 million for damages for violating two Merck patents in connection with Gilead’s highly successful medicines, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge found another misconduct and failed to follow Merck’s lead.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a file Thursday that Gilead is entitled to pardon fees that arose in connection with representing the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for new-generation anti-Yellow C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes from 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owners of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead drugs.
US-backed military says it has gained full control of the city of Manbij
U.S.-backed military forces gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city after the departure of the rest of the radicals who have been hiding in the city.
The troops liberated more than 2,000 civilians who were detained by the radicals, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij military council told Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it,” he told Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, saying that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue in the year and had made a 34.2% real tax.
Clinton was donated $1 million to charity in 2015, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. President Bill Clinton contributed to the joint fund an amount of almost $5.3 million in fees for lectures, and the former Foreign Minister awarded her a $3 million income to a Simon & Schueler from
Clinton’s co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published tax returns in 10 years.
They paid a real tax of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton’s campaign assistant.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and renounces his earlier promises to make his tax returns public.
It is customary for presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if they are not required by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited the U.S. Treasury Department’s audit as a reason for his refusal to publish tax returns.
"Your move," Hillary Clinton's campaign aide said on Twitter, referring to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until the audits are over.
Trump’s critics, including Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, business transactions, and various other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton made a strong statement on the issue and released a video on Friday reminding how high the Republicans are urging Trump to make his tax returns public.
On Thursday, he addressed the issue in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades - to make his tax returns public," she said.
Politico said Trump had paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants as saying it could still be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure that everyone who earns more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, Buffett called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also audited by the IRS and that Trump was “not afraid” of the Treasury, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton’s tax return for 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, their earnings are only $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human habitations - throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
This procedure has proven to be successful and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use this non-violent four-step procedure to protect their homes and crops.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they developed this ... toolkit, we’ve seen a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
The first and second step is to light a flashlight on the passing elephant and start the horn.
If it does not degrade it, the so-called "cloud of chili" will be ejected.
The chili powder mixed with salt is wrapped in a condom along with the firecracker, its end is engraved so that only a button looks at it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a fine powder of chili is dispersed into the air.
Usually one bell suffices and the elephant moves in a different direction.
The last option is to ignite the fireworks, which will cause a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director leans on Berlin hotel for removing code for calls to Israel at Arabs' "request" - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin has sparked a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the employee based on the "demand" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel call code list.
The state, however, was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and erased?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility to call to Israel via its own call center.
The director looked for an explanation and turned to the reception of the hotel with a problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, according to his words, “shocked.”
The hotel employee replied that the measure was “decided at the discretion of the management of Kempinski Hotels.”
The reason for this move prompted the director even more.
“Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that Israel’s calling code be erased,” Lanzmann said in a letter to the staff.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a “great disgrace.”
We were shocked and shocked by the event.
It is a great shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in addition in such a hotel chain is an even greater shame.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The incident triggered a strong online reaction, which people called a scandal.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
“Shame on you,” says another post, pointing out that the hotel, which is located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street, is near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel newspaper, the hotel itself quickly made any accusations by calling the incident a "disgrace" and apologizing to Lanzman.
“Never issued a direct order” not to include Israel in the list of call codes, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung representative of the Kempinski hotel.
Adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesting Brazilian students
The student-police clash took place in Brazil’s San Paul on Thursday as students gathered to demonstrate against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against the protesters.
The problem erupted when government law enforcement tried to disperse the students, which resulted in police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the governor of the state of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin to save money is also the closure of almost hundreds of public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators could be seen spraying inscriptions against interim President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate decided to indict her.
Trade between Russia and Iran up 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran, trade turnover increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
The ambassador said that since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies that trade in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The surge in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, a Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travel visas.
In addition, Iran is among the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia for the first time.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iran to Russia from last year will be exceeded," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visited by a relatively small number of Russians. The Ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
“Personally, I can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition,” he said.
Cattle Callum Skinner rushes home after Britons win gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in a men's team sprint at the Rio World Cup when the VB team trio defended the 2012 London title.
A thirty-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the brakes he took for his Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man delighted the legend when he clung to the finish line and stole the victory from favored New Zealand.
Britain surprisingly won four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the track cycling world championship in March, even though Hoy had meanwhile ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for specialist introductory racer Jamie Staff.
Hindes arrived just in time.
After Hoya's departure, a spot was also vacated, which he tried to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was champion with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but took over the jersey in the first round New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
Changing strategy was a big part of the transformation, when Hindes went to a higher gearbox to slow down and allow Kenny and partially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes took to the stage, he kept his eyes on them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of myself and do the honor of my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew the note and Britain's rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
There was no such problem this time around this victory.
Hindes said, "With all those British flags on the stands, I felt like I was in London."
Over the past three months, we've all been together as a team.
We have lost in many world races, so to win the Olympics again is simply amazing.
It’s one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we have five successful days waiting for us at the Velodrome.
With the form Kenny presented, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time at one Olympics.
That would then mean a total of six golds and one silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy - who also has a birthday on 23 March (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, on this day also celebrates Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
No matter how much Hoy got.
Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and lasts for another three days.
An 18-year-old native of Bolton said, “I’m enjoying this now.
The team race is always the best.
You win with others.
To tell you the truth, winning on your own is a bit lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the only medal race that day, but there was still more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the four-kilometre race.
Finished at 3:51,943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (22:42) will be held on the second day of the race, which Wiggins will surely focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when the referees asked him to measure the height.
In a similar women’s race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record with a time of 4:13,260.
The VB team relied on its strong track cycling team and mastered the middle period of the Olympics and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, showing absolute supremacy in Beijing and London, expectations fell during preparations for Rio.
Dramatic events took place in the background, not least the resignation of Shane Sutton’s technical director in April on charges of sexism and discrimination, and the ending of the careers of giants such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the race at the velodrome, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of Portland smelters after energy supply contract ends
The future of the Portland aluminium smelting plant in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain due to the power plant, which the company supplies electricity and which informed about the intention of one of the owners of the smelting plant to terminate the contract for the supply of electricity.
This step comes after the Victorian state government decided earlier this year not to extend the grants that keep the company running.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2,000 jobs, direct or indirect, may be at risk of closure.
And since the smelting plant consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, further avalanche impacts can occur.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa tavern in Portland is cheap and is in danger of closing.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the plant’s production prices.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with small business holdings held by the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the smelting plant will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts were so-called ‘insurance contracts’, which were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for fiscal year 2017,” the plant said.
Any possible impact on AGL’s earnings from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently limited due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of contracts according to its accounting books at $187 million “in case of termination.”
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contract “does not affect its ... ability to operate the melting mill or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting mill.”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into effect in November this year, although it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland smelting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the industry.
AGL chief operating officer Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in market demand [of electricity].
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashians' real-estate TV show - now it's the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, the model and fourth daughter of Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the cover of the September issue of Vogue magazine.
Kendall, the brand’s ambassador for Estee Lauder, who showed at fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this cover,” Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the title page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a humorous continuation in the presentation of the Kardashians?) staged video in which the entire family of Kardashians-Jenners (bar rebels Rob and Caitly and with them all could be a favorite uncle from the showroom, the showroom is the showroom, producer Seae.
It's the bounded storyline of almost every "birthday" part of a children's television show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o'clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure that the others would be seen.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we are definitely entering a new era of the Kardashians.
Kim's older sister may have pressed Kendall on the Vogue cover (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the year.
The edition, which in its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that out of 832 pages in last year's edition, there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The revelation of the star, which appears on the cover, is unexpected, so it’s no surprise that in the past two years, the magazine’s images have leaked even before its official publication.
Among the women who have appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has been more “celebrity who make models” than “models who are celebrities.”
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador, appeared on the headline in 2013, a year later she was honored by Laga Gaga.
But while it’s highly unlikely that Kendall — whom the magazine describes as the “breakthrough model” of her generation — will fall into the first category, she’ll be in very good company.
These celebrities are not the relatives of famous people, nor the stars of real estate shows, or the children of today who know how to make a well-cut video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner’s success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "whores of the moment".
These feelings rekindled with the news that Jenner appeared on the Vogue cover.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense.
Shows for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she performs in a reality show, perhaps only as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Community Legal Aid Centres Reject 160,000 People a Year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in community legal aid centres, and the sector itself is preparing for impacts that will further limit funding for already overburdened services.
In Queensland, three out of five people—mostly elderly people, immigrants, endangered workers, victims of violence, and people without the funds to fight unjust relocation and the like—are refusing as soon as they seek free legal aid and intervention.
Community legal services, which are already so strained to crack, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Community Legal Aid Centres in Queenslad, said according to the latest summary report by the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, 5,000 people have been rejected each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without the federal government's decision being reversed, the situation will worsen.
“Community legal aid centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped relationships with the abuser, people with excessive and debilitating debts, families going through segregation, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they don't have a chance to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent as of June 2017, leading to thousands more at-risk people from Queensland having to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We call on Queensland Attorney General and Senator George Brandis to immediately prevent this cut in funding, so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
Over the past year, the state government has made a commitment to provide legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centers and the community of their clients, and the Palaszczyuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign charges after a staff member allegedly pointed a gun at him
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for alleged inactivity after they were told that the North Carolina Chief of Operations pointed a gun at a staff member during a jeep ride in February.
The incident was described in a court filing that was handed over to the Charlotte state court on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software trainer in the state.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he came to the conclusion that "it will not happen."
Director Earl Phillip "pointed his fingers at the pistol, put the right pointer on the trigger and pointed the barrel at Vincent's skull," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file says that Bordini, following a complaint with the local and regional leadership of the campaign, found that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
"Weapons do not have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential nominee elicited a stir when he told voters in North Carolina that they could step in with gun owners and holders (which is regulated in the U.S. Second Amendment) if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected as co-elect.
Trump’s campaign says the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent oversight and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, the illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news outlet in the city of Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one answered a call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services within a short period of time.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as London was in 2012, when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our nations and regions could benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games brought huge benefits to both Startford and East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new learning places, 40,000 new jobs, and end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who will think that the Heathrow extension is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would laugh at ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow it turns out that they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project in which many people and companies participate, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, to leave a legacy of skills and employment both near the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that, on time and with a fixed budget, has put in place an infrastructure investment program for <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, starting with the T5 terminal - which was chosen as the best terminal in the world for five years in a row, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two busiest ranches in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third ranch, costing <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the UK and I am convinced that the Heathrow expansion will be too.
It’s time to further spread the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, secure future trade, and leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Vice President of Business Affairs at the Department of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in game on cat and mouse in ad blocking
Attempts to bypass ad-blocking programs have become a game of cat and mouse for companies that make money on online marketing. At least that's what one of the companies that program such software claims.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site stating that users can update filters in their program and block ads on that social network again.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already been bypassed.
Adblocker spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open source ad blocking community and those trying to bypass it has been going on since ad blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another one of its own fixes.
The fact that the company, which owns the largest social network in the world, was involved in the war only proves how much of a problem the blocking of ads for industry has become.
According to a study conducted by Pagefair last year, Adobe uses advertising filters around 200 million people around the world – almost four times as many as it did in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook ad revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook every day from mobile devices.
A spokesman said the company was opposed to desktop ad filters because mobile ad filters on mobile apps for social networks and Instagram did not work.
Desktop advertising still represents a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update the ad preferences tool to give people a better control over how ads are displayed to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters were troubling them because they could also block content on the site that is not related to advertising.
“This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Blocking ads is an insensitive tool, which is why we’d rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses of an incident in which a woman who allegedly tried to commit suicide was driven across the highway by several cars on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the "desperate act" actress was lying in the dark on the road and passed by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interrogated, but according to the police, not all have been identified yet. The police are calling on these drivers and all others who have witnessed the accident to report.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the involved drivers will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent an impact?
The plaintiff must find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases over the past five years, it seems that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, the newspapers said.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of negligent manslaughter charges after she struck and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne in the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim drank alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was driving in an appropriate manner and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident that occurred at Morges should report to the police on the phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agencies (ACCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague as part of the Prague Pride.
This was announced by A<0xC4><0x8C>CKA Executive Director Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> on Friday.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival brings the lives of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBTs) closer together.
Last year, about 35,000 people took part in the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations in the LGBT community for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses," Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to a survey by the organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of CZK 3100 per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications etc.
“For tourism in general, the LGBT clientele is very lucrative, is interested in staying in higher priced sessions with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others,” Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
This year, the first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held as part of the festival’s programme.
Experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China are speaking at the event.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be a traditional parade with allegorical cars on Saturday, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
The parade, attended by thousands of people in recent years, this year will celebrate a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the June attack on a nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrate 40 years.
The indescribable cuttlefish Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have been entertaining both small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot part of the evening series directed by Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1> premiered on August 12, 1976.
The creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, was the cartoon jokes of the artist and director Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1>, who invented for the magazine with two crafts Mr. Ouhol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Sedle<0xC4><0x8D>.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> then invited the playwright Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kub<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek and the artist Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Jir<0xC3><0xA1>nek to collaborate and together they created the film Kut<0xC3><0xA1>ci.
Today's form with a yellow and red trick and a ball and a radio was given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak Television began to be created in the Short film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat kutilové were then given in 1985, this time it was filmed directly for the Short film Prague.
In 1990 Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1> founded his own studio of the animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of whom were played by Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s son Marek.
Currently, there are over ninety episodes with stories of these cuticles, with which everything spills under their hands, but they never get angry at each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and cuticle enthusiasm and are finally satisfied with their work, which proves the familiar gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs to theaters and characters or other toys depicting Pat and Mat are a hit of every toy business.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for the two-year Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sports and one of life.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has been a historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical girlfriend and is happy with her.
What are the things that people spend the most on at airports?
This is Friday's review of the world's websites.
The first medal of the Olympic Games.
The island state of Fiji celebrates its historic success.
The rugby selection of this archipelago was defeated in the final of the Olympic tournament by the seven-point rugby team of Great Britain.
This is the first time Fiji has won a medal in the Olympics.
Waiting for the first precious metal to be won took sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympic Games was sent.
A great credit to the success of the coach of Fiji.
It is ironic that it is Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen could be satisfied, unlike his countrymen.
“Let’s play freely and lightly and see if we can make the biggest game in our history,” he said before the final.
Fiji was finally sovereign and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
This was reported by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and good luck for a little girl.
2 year old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without arms and legs since 11 months, has made a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's just like me," a two-year-old girl said as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to remove the doll's arms and legs and then sit together without prostheses.
The harmony was diagnosed in less than a year of life with type B meningitis, doctors gave it only a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He's got a lead, too.
I saw her introduce herself to other children with the words Hello, I am Harmony and I have no hands.
Look at how much joy the doll has caused.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
According to CNN, people at airports will spend the most money on bottled water.
Hudson’s travel essential stores has released data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products customers buy most often at its airport stores.
The water was the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, eight of them were placed in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large package of M&M candy with a coconut flavor.
And can you guess who closes the top ten?
As one of the above things, you can’t eat.
According to CNN, it is the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
The magazines include U.S. Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Sailing Sovereigns.
We're just going to win, they laughed at Murray and Bond.
Rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand have been sovereignly ruling the rowerless doubles category for seven years and have also confirmed their dominance at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the pair have switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing competition since 2009.
At the Rodrigo de Freitase lagoon, they scored their 69th win in a row in Thursday’s final.
What are we different from the others?
We are simply prettier, Murray joked during the Olympic regatta, when he was supposed to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
Honestly, we don’t do anything different than others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy," Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is remarkable also because they are physically different.
Murray is an almost two-metre and a sledgehammer, academically-looking Bond is five centimetres smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they have a different nature.
Bond studies and finances, Murray has a charitable boxing match, for example.
Because of this, they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's basically getting on the ship with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what could go wrong, Bond admitted, who even at a press conference made clear that Murray was the dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to respond, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, it destroys opponents with calm force.
They are moving at their own pace, and although they are often still not in the lead in the middle of the track, opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We raced on a two-kilometre track and we never wanted to go the first kilometre to the finish.
We're just trying to move at a pace that no one else can.
“We know what we have to do to win,” said 34-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both were members of the Golden Four without a helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Olympics in Beijing a year later, they decided to move to a two-seater without a helmsman.
At the Olympics in London, they lost their biggest defeat of their career and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London has been very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask us anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
"We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well," Murray said.
We know that they all want to overthrow us from the throne.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we are trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, whose surface is hot, water-free and saturated with CO2, conditions similar to those on Earth could prevail.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation speed of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, Venus once seemed to boast a rare Earth-like atmosphere while spinning slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet was probably drier than the Earth, but once upon a time there was enough water and geographic diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to also use the Sun, which was 30 percent more muted.
“In a GISS model simulation, Venus exposes its daily side to the sun during a slow rotation for almost two months at a time,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a new report.
In this way, the surface is heated and rain is generated, which creates a dense layer of clouds that act as an umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures, which are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus similar to the evolution that previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and water vapor was burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen has leaked and only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas effect remains -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Colorado Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche's hockey operations vice president and coach on Thursday, saying he was unable to take part in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado Executive Vice President/General Manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move, saying the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have served as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
“I’ve been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the play-offs, and in the past two years, he has not always had a good run after the season.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the 2015/2016 season and missed five points to get the second wild card in the Western Conference.
Roy, who signed up for the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on the North Sea oil rig resume talks and stop the strike
The leaders of the negotiating parties said the strikes over wages for oil workers in the North Sea were interrupted, while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group have sporadically occurred on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process for resolving the current disputes,” the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent in protest against wage cuts.
Wood Group lowered rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The rate cut comes after a 10 percent cut for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the companies room to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has removed thousands of people from its payrolls and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries to modernize its processes – immediately following a mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain’s June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes of an entire generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the region's economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some,” he said.
By comparison, in 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiades
The Kepler Space Telescope's latest mission to assist astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the rotational speeds of stars from the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, and also how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age and even history in its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Pasade Processing and Analysis Center, said in a new report.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and formed over 125 million years ago.
Now it spins the fastest.
At the moments of maximum rotational speeds, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As a star ages, its rotational speed also slows down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of discernible points on stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, the bigger ones make the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slower rotating stars are more massive, while those that spin the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and the speed of rotation.
"The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There’s still a lot we want to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their spinning speed and so to say “hang their dancing shoes on a nail.”
Rebull and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the rotational speeds of the Pleiades in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a Qualification Agreement Necessary?
If I did not sign up, would the qualification agreement not be concluded and after a few months I could move to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without enrolling in a specialization education?
My point is that in the field where I would like to work, there is now a job vacancy only in a slightly more distant hospital, but in about half a year there could be a job vacancy in another one, where I would like to work afterwards.
So I don’t know how to deal with the situation about that half-year, the question continues.

No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with an employer - a hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution regulated by the Labour Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the reimbursement of the costs incurred in increasing or deepening the employee’s qualifications.
In the field of health, however, there is long-term pressure to not conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare workers and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Law No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional qualifications and specialised qualifications for the exercise of the medical profession of a doctor, a dentist and a pharmacist, it is expressly stated that participation in specialised training is considered to enhance the qualification (not to increase it).
This means that a qualification agreement can be concluded according to the Labour Code only if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
There is no legal obligation to enroll in specialised education.
The law only lays down the conditions for applying for inclusion in the field of specialised education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is authorized to perform the profession of a doctor already due to the completion of the necessary university studies, although under the conditions stipulated by the law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation in which professional practice completed in another field of specialization can be included in the specialization education of a doctor, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the interviewer.
However, given the fact that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it is advisable to consult the relevant committee of the Ministry of Health (Committee of Science and Medical Professions), since the Ministry of Health by law provides an advisory and advisory service related to the inclusion in the course of specialization education and its course.
The Czech Medical Chamber also provides the advisory service free of charge, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from the Syrian city of Halab are calling for US intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (rebellious parts of the city by government troops), and has not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, according to a letter to the White House.
"We don't need tears, compassion, and even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure Halab is not encircled again," the doctors said.
Russian forces supporting the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have announced that they will stop strikes in the Halab area every day for three hours to allow safe passage for humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 SEL<0xC4><0x8C> all military activities, air strikes and artillery fire are to be stopped.
U.N. chief of humanitarian operations Stephen O'Brien welcomed the move, but stressed the need for at least a two-day ceasefire.
According to AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who work in the eastern part of the country, which is controlled by the rebels, have been contacted by Obama in the letter.
It says that during the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world looks at how complex Syria is, but it does little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly concealed threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors said.
Doctors said there were 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria in the past month, including 15 on the hospitals they work in.
We are most saddened by the fact that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
“In the emergency room, young children come to us with injuries so serious that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don’t even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns were strangled when the explosion disrupted oxygen supplies to their incubators.
They caught their breath and then their life ended - before they could really start, they remembered.
The army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has in recent weeks surrounded the rebel-held eastern part of Halab, with more than 200,000 people without food supplies inside.
The rebels, who are under constant Russian and Syrian air strikes, managed to break through the encirclement and launch a counteroffensive after three weeks on Saturday.
Both sides then joined the city and reinforced its surroundings.
