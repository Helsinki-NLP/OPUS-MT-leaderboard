<0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the bakery
The new councillors of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the obvious language barriers for the components of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed comrades of the SDG.
The period Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz "examined" the members of the new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Council to check their knowledge of the language marked slang that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The codified dictionary that used Prague's political flower and cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the city's best-known characters, situations, and causes.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors almost do not understand these well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I am rather a novice in Prague's politics," said cultural councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> during the "college" terminology exam.
And as for the veteran politician, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted the same way.
Maybe they know the concept of a golf hole.
“Maybe it’s the only expression of all you’ve ever asked me to use from time to time.”
"If not, I usually don't use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by Aktualn<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>.cz newspaper last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial staff chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the Prague municipal authorities.
The socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "largest golf hole in Prague", "going to the pastry shop", "bullshit", "treason of the capital" and "blinding".
Three councillors agreed to undergo the test and a fourth, Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, refused to do so.
“I don’t get into these things and I don’t think I’m going to appreciate how civic democrats have fun.”
“What really matters to me is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As has been seen, Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> supposedly did not realize that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of the former mayor of Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
To Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> the word "Voldemort" does not say anything; the only term he found in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, who immediately adds: "But I rather know it from the news."
“I’m going to have to sign up for a language course,” he jokes.
Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Environmental Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort really is and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where to find that character; furthermore, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon it is revealed to Plach<0xC3><0xBD> that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janousek.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among socio-democrats.
“I asked my classmates, but it really looks like we don’t have anything like it.”
"Rather, among us, we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or make games of words with names," says the president of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, whose party comrades call Hulda.
“I was called B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za at school, but I don’t know if my classmates call me that,” B<0xC5><0x99>ezina confesses.
The newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>l<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tested the name and it works.
For his party comrades, Weinert is D<0xC4><0x9B>da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they were associated before the elections deceptions during the sponsorship of the party, receives the nickname "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" ("playmobile") from some of his comrades.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to be called Hulda, but Aktualn<0xC3><0xBD>.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of the rights of the nails" apparently remembers that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> obtained his doctorate in Law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as published in a pamphlet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually elderly, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men seldom suffer like that."
“Healthy young women are also not isolated, because they help with work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the state capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso, is occupying a special residence of more than one hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information leaflet that should help prevent witch hunts.
However, this has a stick.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read,” warns Die Standard newspaper about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate set of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman got caught in the oil that is used for ritual anointings.
It was set on fire when the group wanted to "throw out the evil spirits" from the woman.
Isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: “The devourers of human souls have always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
Gambian President Jammeh, following the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that had allegedly been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself by black magic.
“To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, forcibly took randomly chosen men and women from the Gambian peoples to the President’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a bunch of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that also caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the detainees did not survive the stay on the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand people arrested.
The tenant of Bakala: is heated with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, aged and old, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty company of the "coal magnate" Zde<0xC5><0x88>ek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he was carrying documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his own, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is serving a sentence.
All three have just caught up in the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the child will pay 4,100 crowns from next year for a two-room apartment with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," shows the man with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But, before this, man only makes an ademan.
"Everybody says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great test laboratory for liberalization.
After New Year will happen with the vast majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
That's why Aktualj.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are security guards and next to them a number picking machine.
"Rent 2011", you can read on a bright button on your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
There is almost no time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Shortly after, an older marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as in the past: requests for settlements, insurance issues and similar issues.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava in the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes on the cards a rent increase of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for the new rentals.
“It’s been running for a week, so it’s starting,” the workers, after briefly doubting it, respond when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and Bakala’s former mining flats are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament from Ostrava, Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek, of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, already treated them loud and clear, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
“Twenty years later, I want a new floor.”
"I didn't even change the damn bathroom dish," the man mentioned in the introduction unravels.
According to the workers, at the moment they come more than anything retirees to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half the discount on the February rental.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
“Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rental in 2011 about forty or fifty people,” the employee of the window estimates.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rental, the matter must be settled by an independent judge.
“This is not a threat, but information about the only possible way to proceed and fully comply with the law,” RPG warns on its pages.
“No one is going to be judged here,” says one of Byty’s RPG employees, and a man standing on the street in front of the customer service center gives her, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I don’t have the means to go to court,” he says.
But immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait," he said.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
“Current rents still do not even cover the amounts needed to maintain the community fund,” recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of the RPG Byty company, adding that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing rent.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014, the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlights in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square meter per month," it said on the screen.
Only increased by 38% the rental of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square meter," says RPG.
At 2,600 floors, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not suddenly affect rents, but will scale between four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent rise (see graph) back into the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rental agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need daycare
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with all the same to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to it.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio came out numerous well-known buildings in Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-kindergarten.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom and they wanted to allow the architects and outliners to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility to enjoy a reduced schedule, the daycare is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers to its workers as part of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-kindergarten was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-kindergarten is financed through the European Social Fund under the Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme, as well as from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a grant of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding runs out (two years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to keep the mini-kindergarten running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and in the submission of the application for financing contributed the company Economy Rating.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified staff, and a nurse and teacher from the Ministry of Education are present for their care throughout the day. The daycare centre currently houses children with no age limit, although most of them are under three years old.
Since it is a "mini-kindergarten", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the contents of the mini-kindergarten program are comparable to the usual pre-school curriculum.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach to English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive atmosphere.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive while they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design ranks among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, in short, this program strengthened the marketing of personnel.
The House of Bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Observe the interiors of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Because of its skeleton-like shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the novel use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade reminiscent of the scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
The cover of the house plays with dreamy lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and wildlife.
Paying more attention, one observes a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought-out order.
At night, the whole facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Snake and the twist of the shapes continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the window frames, railings, door ornaments, lookouts and signs.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA0>cia, arose from the remodeling of a house from the year 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of making a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, consisting of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
The architect Josep Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their project plans ornaments appeared for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
Other creators and artists also work on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Güell Park, in which other pieces of the same are found.
Due to its organic form, the locals soon after its completion dubbed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawnings".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, appears the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
It can be strange its inclination of forty-five degrees.
During construction, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> did not respect at all the rules of construction of the moment and did not let himself be influenced by them.
Nevertheless, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so shocked by the result that it asked for it to be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
Arrangements were never made, quite the opposite: just fifteen days after the city council’s request, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> applied (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely traversed by a staircase leading up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the living rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>, not only obtained a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with the two colors brings maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the sun's rays.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most recharged apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of admission to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount exceeds considerably the price of entry of other buildings of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true ambience of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit them at home.
How to choose a mattress and bedside table: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really imparts its quality to a good bed is the lying surface, i.e. the mattress and the bedside table.
First of all, they must be perfectly complemented in order to adapt to specific users.
During the choice, numerous elements come into play, including the owner’s weight, height, state of health and sex.
It is also important the type of interior on which the mattress and the bedside table are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that usually does not have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them more often.
If the canals of the center are not properly aerated and, on top of them, are on a firm basis, they keep moisture inside.
When it comes to choosing a bed, habits also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft coat and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
“Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL were complaining that they weren’t sleeping as well here.”
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft viscoelastic layer."
"These types of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have problems with the nervous system, so they receive poor information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate viscoelasticity.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing puts pressure on him; during the night, he won’t turn around like after a hard game.
He just sleeps better.
Viscoelasticity also acts as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example singles, it is recommended to be between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when lying face up, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk to the elbows," advises the engineer Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, expert of Cechu <0xC4><0x8D>aloun<0xC3><0xAD>k<0xC5><0xAF> to decorators, who has for many years been dealing with the problematic of healthy sleep and ergonomics in the furniture.
In the double rooms, everyone needs their own mattress and mattress, so during the purchase it is necessary to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bedspreads at different heights, which is not always possible on all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interior a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and smoothness.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you settle on the mattress, you should definitely not notice the springs," warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a certain type of mattress.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and you can’t wash your cover, which is often done today.
And, since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will start to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, the sellers give a tip: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of the cleaning and washing of the cover, but it is better to add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers with zipper closure are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when opened they are left in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a bedside table, do you have a firm board?
Never, ever!
At the very least for beds designed to spend one night visiting.
However, it should make (if you don't already have them) ventilation holes in the board and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulate sheet mattresses containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although a mattress with a higher number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar region can be reinforced and reinforced is always better.
Articulated sheet slats should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fastening of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "round" the shoulders perfectly during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "males", began to use a softer area just around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are cross-structured or tiled sockets with the so-called multi-torsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that, even if you use the proper mattress and bedside table, if you use a bad pillow (large and "soft"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach to the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, which is normal in Scandinavia, for example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder-reinforced mat or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses seem to have something to do with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
The petroleum-based raw materials, with which the polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biologically, in the case of mattresses, it means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" themselves with vegetable extracts from the breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warmth.
Favorites at the moment?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold foam and viscoelastic stiffness allows you to make mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels are going.
A good quality mattress will cost you 7,000 crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as health means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and mattresses.
Sometimes you can approve the offers of the manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a Memory foam attached to the cover for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is available for free.
The era of viscoelasticity with an open cellular structure and high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
It initially emerged as material for NASA, because during takeoffs the astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used on mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents are using people tracking devices to monitor their children
The fear of children is driving more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track the movement of people and contribute in this way, for example, in the case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
“We’re all trying to tell ourselves that it’s not about spying, but another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone’s pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases.”
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> warns about the fact that, if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even the youngest children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to keep them from being controlled.”
“In the past, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> says.
In his opinion, it is questionable whether in the event of an attack such a device is really useful.
"If it's a premeditated kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always check if the child is wearing any kind of electronic device that can reveal their location."
“Now it’s the phone.”
"As the use of tracking devices expands, it will also look for them, since their sale will certainly be carried out with a lot of advertising."
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the event of an improvised attack from a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can help.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If it suffers damage, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The most expensive devices carry an integrated tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and stays motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, in which only special software must be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a size similar to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for this reason, tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
“In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device.”
“Or identify him after a certain amount of time, which can make the police time-saving,” he adds.
Although the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the verification of the position with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to encircle the whole Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to seize explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of wick to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosive wick from STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
The General’s staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick saying soldiers need 60 kilometers of wick a year for training maneuvers.
According to the calculations of the army's pyrotechnicians, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, such maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, senior officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want either Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and Army Captain Vlastimil Picek exempt.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to expend sixty kilometers of wick.
This is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have enough stock for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even the shooting practices for money are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also fail to understand that we are repeatedly bought such amounts of wick."
"But it's their decision and they'll know why they're acting like this."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we as a company try to satisfy," admits Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, commercial director of STV Group.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek defends the hundreds of miles of wick, also saying he will have stockpiles of this “munition” for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, of STV Group, indicates that the wick only has a lifespan of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, of two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of wick, it obtained a discount.
“It cost us 60% less than last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” said Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense’s shopping center.
Just to compare: the annual wick consumption of police pyrotechnicians, who remove World War II ammunition or that left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only the right amount to deplete the ammunition before its useful life ends.
This was decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and in the meantime more modern and reliable wick types can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: it will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is now buying "cheap".
So far I still live from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
The last edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the Year" 28-year-old entrepreneur Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story seems to come from a movie.
And Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank credit, he bought a house that was half-roofed composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
“At present, the value for money of the accommodation in our area has prompted me to do something about it,” says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He began renting the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested back in the building, which he gradually converted into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he has gradually opened four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories in Liberec.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” said the number one businessman last year.
“This sale of hotel opening licenses was greatly helped by winning the Entrepreneur of the Year contest,” added grateful Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity in and around Liberec.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” he recalls.
Definitely recommend to everyone who wants to try some company that participates in the contest.
But he considers that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he still lives on contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
“With some people I met thanks to the contest I started collaborating routinely.”
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
In total about seventy.
“I’ve seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that has won general recognition.”
"It's not, much less, my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the whole team."
“Only my name appears in the foreground,” says today modestly Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we have had in Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition "Company of the Year", last year in the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury appreciated their efforts, with which they managed to turn a small technical workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition,” says the winner last year.
The history of the company Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the state proposed to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father the renting of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo on properties during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the competition in the media.
“Not only did our customers start to consider the Farmet brand as considerably better, but foreign partners also started to value the collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year might not have been at Farmet just a show of the euphoria of victory.
It also gained recognition for its business results up to 2008 and, in part, 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year to sell machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, do not get rid of such a situation either."
“The revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must, at times, take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and kept the company’s profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut spending was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training center, strengthened our presence in the international market and obtained excellent ratings at national fairs," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
All indications are that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are increasing again and with them the number of new employees.
“The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that uncovers ridiculous norms
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He's already managed to get rid of some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested an extract from the trade register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer request an extract from the commercial register when it carries out a check of the insured's taxes," said <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The aim of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year, for the fourth time, it forms part of the business tournament of Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny and begins to create a passion among the general public.
While last year’s edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it almost reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations left over that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in the number of papers needed for the tax return we are first in the world," says Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is in position 74a, that is, eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated the same way every year.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "anti-award" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year's survey, more than one hundred were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year’s seventy proposals is published on the contest pages.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held at the beginning of November in the Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which political and social figures often participate.
This year, for example, they attended this event of the contest Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state continuously puts obstacles to entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not remain in sludge water.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the obligation of the employer to communicate, three days in advance, to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to attend a trade fair or exhibition with a post.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended in second place in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was removed in the so-called green card law.
And the third one is the winner.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
That is why this year the Ministry of Health issued a statement saying that it had removed the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the contest of Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny is the category called Company responsible for the year 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
“In this way, we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone’s mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of the main contest of Vodafone Company of the year 2010, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is, for example, disabled people, in others, the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague-based software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the area of Pardubice is the company Isolit-Bravo, which for seven years has been the main donor of funds to sponsor disabled children.
In Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, there is a stationery shop that is especially concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the workforce; that is why it was awarded the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the year contest finished third in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which cut working hours even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities have the lowest possible impact on the environment,” explains entrepreneur Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The responsible IT company Enlogit in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and at its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona in trouble scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the company's representative Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
The laundry company Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a p<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD> of the Karlovy Vary region is also well placed with a mention, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that affect their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transportation, skills improvement and leisure," says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>, of the construction company Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of Responsible Company of the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year contest were automatically appointed who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
The organizers removed forms that were not complete or wrong from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the year contest, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the year contest."
“Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main Company of the Year competition,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police have made several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
It appears that it is attempting to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land is received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million crowns.
“At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender,” Pilsen Attorney General Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1> told Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo, adding that she cannot disclose further details about the ongoing investigation.
Twenty-four hours later, police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On how it could influence the public auction, given the little official information, can only be speculated.
A spokeswoman for the Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> Agricultural Fund responded to Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo’s questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
“It’s a customer, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public auction is called "Call for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the land law" and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a higher value than their return, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Based on the bids, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest bid," the Fund's spokeswoman explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had information about who was going to submit to the call and, since at the same time he is an interested person because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to interested parties on the ground that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
He was involved in the case of the former head of the PF V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankot, who was accused of speeding up the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has just obtained from the Fund land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular at the site where a large road to the industrial area of Borsk<0xC3><0xA1> pole should be built.
Afterwards, he exchanged them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself with a much higher value.
In this case, the city had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay an additional cost of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating accessories and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns a month from the portfolio, starting in January, more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 crowns more per year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers lowered prices, as support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaics, has increased.
However, the gas is moderately hardened, especially at the time when heating is used the most and therefore the higher the consumption.
In this case, they should also count on a couple of hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are depleted across the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will pay an additional 50 crowns per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay an additional 1,000 crowns per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in water and heating prices, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the Pragians will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest across the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
Rental prices for 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where regulation will end in January, can rise considerably.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 floors in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take those who disagree with the new rental to court.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase next year by as much as 10%.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer in mode, because it slowly takes effect
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers to end up in medical care under the age of fifteen.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
“Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get them drunk.”
"Now the fashion is the strong alcoholic beverages," says the head of pediatrics of the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in the center of Bohemia, Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
“When they manage to get a bottle of their father out of the closet, it can be whiskey, but it’s usually Fernet and vodka.”
“Wodka has the advantage of being lightened with juice and not smelling as much,” he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman of Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Normally, it's Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
“In some cases, they use cigarette butts that they picked up at home,” Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> adds.
According to Chief Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, 13- and 14-year-old drinkers often appear in hospitals.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, plus a mixture with ecstasy," the department's doctor said in a statement.
"He was at the Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice fair at some dance party."
“The interesting thing is that his mother wasn’t surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours,” he said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking on the part of their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot really talk about dependence.
“An alcoholic is understood to be a person who has been chronically dependent on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children.”
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
According to the spokesperson Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, this year in the pediatric clinic of Motol hospitalized until mid-November forty children drunk.
However, the statistics only show those who come with a serious poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after walking medical recognition, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink liquor, there are three seasonal ups and downs for Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n to mention: Witch’s Day, New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink from the bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
“On Witch’s Day, I’ve come to see up to seven drunken children at a time,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n said.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
"They are much better at it, because after the hectic night, they get up well and it doesn't hurt anything."
“They are only confused about where they are,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n notes, adding that patients often lose good humor at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
The transfer by ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients comes to cost tens of thousands of crowns.
“I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell them directly to the children how much their intoxication has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer on a youth job so that you earn enough to pay yourself that night,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n adds.
Medical insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft found in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159s out of a total of five, with which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time such a device has been found in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seat version L-159T1, which until now was used by the Czech army and was still in a state of flying.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seat aircraft.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, already took over them last week.
Jan Pejesk, from the defense press department, says it is not yet known when the planes will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, with no additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 biplaces were exchanged in their current state," he told Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seat aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for a sum of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new planes already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS committed to adding the aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
“The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for the practices of pilots from NATO countries.”
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek says.
The newspaper Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
The Ministry of Defense did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense direction claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 overseas.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
An index finger longer than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
“Our results indicate that relative finger length may be a simple test for prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to the age of 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same odds of getting prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
For men with an index longer than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows the study, but does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "fully demonstrated".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, on Thursday dawned covered in snow.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly covered by compact snow and snow machines circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between km 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and passenger cars, as well as the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
Las noticias las transmittedi<0xC3><0xB3> el operator del <0xC3><0x9A>cenn<0xC3><0xAD>ho automotoklubu (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At kilometer 91, a truck was damaged, at 93 two industrial vehicles collided that caused injuries.
Also several cars ended up in the queue.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers must drive slowly behind Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and join kilometer 182 in K<0xC3><0xBD>valce.
There have been several miles of traffic jams.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 ° C.
Blockades are forming in Prosek, for example, although <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> and N<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC3><0xAD>ru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check the current situation.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> Airport was closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Currently, it is possible to drive on most of the roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brn<0xC4><0x9B>nska snow tongues are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the places most affected was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
To clean them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment, it is not clear when they will be open to circulation.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nska, caution is required in the area of B<0xC3><0xAD>lé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads of the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more so in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall is gradually receding in the Czech Republic.
U.S. soldiers have a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. military is using a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known at the moment only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that it will “change the progress of the game” towards their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with extremely precise aiming.
Its bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it to actually work like a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point on their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind an obstacle, a wall, or a trench.
Undoubtedly, normal protection cannot be used, and when you throw your killer rain of metal shards, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use “smart” technology.
"Soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point at it its laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise sighting point and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say they've been measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the gun is loaded and the projectile is launched at a distance of 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu consortium relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer industry giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July next year from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, which had previously been spread across the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, “In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt’s head of economics, Markus Frank (CDU), said it won a “Global Player”.
This is a “magnificent recognition to the location.”
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
The management informed the city of their intention.
“Of course we have offered the company our help,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change the difficulties.
After all, the economic motives caused the fall.
In such a way, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining buildings on Marienbader Platz for ten years from a controversial construction project of the spa town.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive building that used the gaps as parking spaces and as regards the level of buildings.
In 2001, investment advisory and appraisal companies have been established, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the home computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, based in Tokyo, is recognized as the world’s third largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more businesses in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That is why they have rented 7,000 square meters in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses, among others, the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anxiety is increasingly taking hold of Wikileaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind it is political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly detained in England.
The Wikileaks revelations platform is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former US server and are currently looking for an internet homeland in Europe.
US Senator Joe Lieberman is calling on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon's server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the revelations' activists said via the messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services website in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
Wikileaks tweeted: “Perfect, we’ll spend our dollars to hire people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman requested investigations, CNN reported, according to a call to Lieberman’s office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British Guardian reported.
“I had wished that Amazon had taken these steps earlier, prior to previous publications of classified information via Wikileaks,” he said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"WikiLeaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless process puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently called the investigation in Sweden a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there have been threats.
“There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange.”
This is why he fears for Assange’s safety, Hrafnsson said.
The location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican governor Mike Huckabee said the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations must be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Chief of Government Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
There is a growing dispute between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had asked for the secretary of state's resignation, in case she was responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage tasks.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website.”
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy distribution director of the National Counter-Terrorism Center, has been appointed exceptional commissioner, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing “important structural reforms,” which are necessary in light of Wikileaks’ leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must endanger the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are prepared to help protect them if necessary.”
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream is prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream come from?
The ice cream maker and the ice cream maker.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The ice cream maker removes the ice cream cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special more-day courses on chocolate ice cream and home ice cream practice.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a teacher of this California art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream master Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step in the process seems easy.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently cools it down to four degrees.
Then open the machine tap and a pasteurized white basic cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without stalisizer?
How can you let go of some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that they keep away from the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream "not only natural ingredients", has probably used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, from guar beans.
Of course, you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of the ice cream, master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to put flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"However, they must experiment sometime."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Course participants can now use the freezers.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
They do the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better does not necessarily depend on having more toffee flavor or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to know nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group produces the adored kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mix highlights the taste of ice cream, Luciano says.
The making of ice cream is a problem of artefacts: Peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, you need to lower the proportion of sugar from the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano pulls out a utensil with which he sets the amount of sugar from the types of fruit (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the count easier.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
Not only helps the tool for the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to a temperature below zero.
In spite of everything, all automation is left out as far as the small paste is concerned.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if he were an uncontrolled mini-first giant.
“In all courses,” says Master Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has infiltrated the industry that experiments with GMO plants.
This issue is currently being raised by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been hired by the Ilsi association for years.
Consortia such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost money.
Kuiper has significantly collaborated on Efsa’s testing standards for genetically modified plants, putting him in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
The provisions of EFSA are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ilsi’s situation and mimic the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a conflict of interest.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking EFSA manager went without the support or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the General Office for the Environment as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, EFSA cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some in the industry, is used, as long as they are of high technical quality, are sorted in a report.
Experts working at EFSA are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But you must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how are you going to find them?” he asks, accusing, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the U.S. and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not generally published.
“The industry controls safety research,” Hilbeck maintains.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has gained some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on his back.
There were demonstrations
Oh, wow.
The story is well known: In September, excavators arrived and began to knock down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart never became the same again: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was debris.
Rota in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They mustn't disappear."
He exclaims: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that comes from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“There would be dishonor, grinding the gravel or sending it to the trash can,” he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a watchhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21st century for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the shooting.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilo heap cut, with a price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
About half are still in the forest, the rest have long been sold.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could take in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of impulse has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“This stone is really nothing special,” says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political component."
Climb your all-terrain, take a tour of your great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he is interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And she's a stone lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the country’s largest ancient stone dealer.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstone stones chopped.
“They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke,” he explains.
Caliza dawn, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
It points a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
"Bonito travertino."
Formerly the massifs belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police chief, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, toba from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple rig and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something was destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to the stone dealer, in addition stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man who takes advantage of the remains.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be rescued.
Fighting talents around great potentials
There is an active influx in the buffet.
16 students cram around breadcrumbs, tomato soup and candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivals and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, come together in a face-to-face struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: Hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labor market and are hired by others.
And since universities don’t provide publications about their students’ skills, they try to sniff out exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, elbows and folders with the VW logo.
Explains to the enthusiastic young talents the internship programs and jobs for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
See benefits for both parties: “Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience.”
“In turn, VW can get to know students, look more closely at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
"The main point previously was in technical projects," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to be advertised and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacancies in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
At the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of the talent hunt.
It organizes costly hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincan, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of election at the start.
Only the cream of the cream of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to pick and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple journey alone was short-lived."
For the Dykta talent hunter the notes give results.
"To date we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
“Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, there are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their labor fairs.
"We try to get students in the specialized fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, a staff member for solar technology maker Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company's website.
“It’s very difficult to fill vacancies.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is the contact with the professors of the university.
Solarworld collaborates with several high schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
“Teachers advise that you can do internships with us or carry out your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium can’t normally offer it,” says Stübe, the staff manager.
When looking for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child support or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers.
The institute compiles an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what it asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the preconditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in her ranking by her aspirants to work.
“I think the applicant looks especially at the external rankings of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to gain a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through employees themselves,” he says.
In the slang of the sector it is called Employer Branding internal, also promotion of corporate identity within the own staff.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has occurred in recent years.
The Washington government issued a stern ban and thereby undeniably overturned its previous plans.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast remain new perforations blocked for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will at least be in force for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Before the disaster that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The proponents thus wanted to reduce U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the moratorium on drilling after the explosion.
Subsequently, various peteroleros consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by employing tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible supervisory authority, which after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is reforming itself.
Obama also announced that he would close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current poll conducted by the consulting firm BDO - ahead of Wednesday's extraction ban.
American Energy Alliance complains of insecurity in the sector: “Nobody knows exactly what changes with regulation.”
Investments in new extraction projects are soon prolonging, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is brown oil, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of oil spilled have wrecked nature in Nigeria’s Ogonilandia.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal trade in oil.
Celestine Akpobari likes it.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures reporters: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil spots float on the surface.
Before here I would pick up shrimp in handfuls, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: Which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogonilandia, is considered one of the most stinky regions in the world.
In the path of the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship’s engine removes a brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, will take out some filled with oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the colliding palms and hanging their palms.
In vain they look for flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier from the outside is silenced, a kind of phantom calm of an earlier paradise with a gas station smell expands in it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," says, hurricane, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
There is a war comparison.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a tough battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, the return of companies to Ogonilandia is prohibited: While they pumped daily more than two million barrels of black gold from the whole delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipes, the oil fields in Ogonilandia were quiet, the location is too instable for the locals.
Every two hundred meters stood out steel platforms like bizarre water sculptures: "Christmas Trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the crash of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with it.
While the Shell consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break and pipes with leaks as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the conventional world, the scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the defect rates of the pipes are "on a multiple higher than elsewhere".
In a place, which from afar seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the open sky, figures arise from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the perforations, sometimes scattered arbitrarily on the ground, a fire flares up: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil heats up in the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the group’s head.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally diesel comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-litre barrels of diesel daily: “It brings us 34,000 naira,” around $22.
The people of the delta take advantage of the shortage of fuel in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of just 40 euros-cents per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: So they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", who called the pipeline network that passes through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this step at least 16 million liters of oil are lost per day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the best part in shacks and sell it cheaply on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate about whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or the lax mode of production purely academic.
“If the oil mills did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the Ogoni are shattered mostly by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as China."
Michael's getting nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular <0xC3><0x96>lmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the special army unit catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This doomed invention has completely shattered our country,” Akpobari said.
Researchers Detect Dangerous Factory Defects in A380 Engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big safety problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce “a catastrophic engine failure.”
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas Airbus passengers who made an emergency landing in early November were far more fortunate than one can imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s thanks to their investigations, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a sleeve connection, cracks can be caused by fatigue or cracks, ATSB authorities announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline has filed lawsuits against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court in Sydney that allowed for more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the brand of the engine have lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will carry out more safety tests on the superjumps equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman for ATSB.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet ashore for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily ashore.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nationwide Nevada Causes Traffic Chaos
Totally white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed almost all over the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: In almost the whole country, chilly temperatures were reached during Thursday night, which has triggered traffic chaos at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the snowmobiles are in continuous operation, removing the new snow again and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects live tides with water levels 1.2 meters above their usual level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on highways and on national roads.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsische Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for winding it.
There, many trucks and cars were trapped during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia snowfall affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the lanes or broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia, an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and rescue service attended the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
Snow winds sweep the streets.
At Germany’s largest airport, snowy winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The snowflakes are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a crossroads in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to the snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver lost his life.
In the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after hitching her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be increasingly mild and dusty and will therefore swirl in soft strokes.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank recently fixed its headquarters: the twin towers in the Frankfurt bank district were modernized; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to profit from the costs of the resale, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" says based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not mention the reasons for the sale in project.
“We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again,” he said.
This is why Germany’s largest credit institution relinquishes its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms amounted to approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor has not currently been disclosed, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who gave themselves up for dead after many explosions in a mine.
However, the bodies have not been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Nearly two weeks ago there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced into the place of misfortune, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Currently, family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Tens of thousands of people have changed with the gleaming sunshine at Greymouth on New Zealand’s South Island.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the miners’ helmets, lamps and names.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothing and surfboards.
The flags waved at half-mast in front of the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," John Key, the New Zealand government's president, told participants at the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume his son's death until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on November 19 were also buried miners of British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gore fit into the artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the genre again with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience will Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A one-eyed imprisoned Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and tear his enemies' guts from their bodies when it's bad.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters get carried away by as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which behind the scenes offer the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a movie has multiple audiences, it’s a shame they can’t rule each other out.
Director Winding Refn regards his savages and the trilogy about the drug dealer hairstyle "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with something more humorous in the mainstream or something less of the art house's brutality.
A bursting brain mass and guts can’t deter most fans of art cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck for an eternity in calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shuts up again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, there is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, it’s all about atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn counts just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and sombre trance soundtrack make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a small blonde young man, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior out of hell for temporary enemies and allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious movie that you can hate and admire, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
About midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that comes out of the river.
According to information from the U.S. CIA International Intelligence Service at the end of April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the nearby el-Kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves other purposes than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from inside.
The reactor was in operation a short time ago, he says, but it was still not equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely more known than it was then, the enigmas grew larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that he saw little indication that there was a “nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more prudent and only speak of a “supposed reactor,” although they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible.”
They lack solid evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor ahead, a senior UN diplomat responded this summer in a stone-throwing way that the IAEA has “enough material to have questions.”
The Syrians quickly cleared the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and deliberately raided the ground.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by humans.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite imagery of a member state, from commercial vendors at the time just after the attack, which must have greater informational value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not make it to the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always hinted that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this, as it has with regard to satellite imagery.
In addition, the controllers are forbidden a second inspection at el-Kibar and entry to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also maintains strict silence.
"We will never comment on it," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded any results since June 2008 and "is progressively turning into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds with a place at the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is pending, for which the IAEA watches.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in enlightenment, which must be “in functional connection” with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not yet publicly disclosed what teams are being treated, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interns, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which most likely is one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria forbids entry to all three sites to the IAEA.
In Vienna, Syrians are said to be afraid of a record that the U.S. has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to warnings from the U.S. Secret Service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three locations and the cube to the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be “related to fuel production.”
But there is “no sign of sensitive activities,” neither of uranium enrichment nor of reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for the bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable trails that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of loads of trucks disappeared from the ground, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometers from the Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as a zone for radioactive waste, unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in a satellite imagery analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But photographs from orbit show that the Syrians made landslides in the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has taken a few months to develop an inspection plan there, so that the Syrians would allow, in order to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus is also criticizing this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, since a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador fencing the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: It requires a majority of the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious about an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: "And what if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her still unnamed debut.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much is known about this, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women’s associations have protested quickly, at the last minute moving a few days of filming planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women’s organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, she told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She is not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
No love stories are given in the rape camps, and Jolie’s position on the matter leaves the victims sufficiently on the script.
Her organization according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended the dismissal of Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture who read the script, granted it after a strip and loosens a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go anyway.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she enters the Yugoslav conflict with great effort, she wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
The content is still inaccurate.
A second synopsis of the film circulates on the network that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the start of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the “rape victim falls in love with torturer” variant.
It is certain that Jolie’s film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Currently they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here
This afternoon is good for the Irish again.
There is no trace of sorrow
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers in Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans shout for joy as loud music rumbles, hitting the ground with their feet.
Bailey club vibrates in South Cork, because players throw, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus some plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this bizarre drinking game and discreet computer really don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with that, distracted from the fulminant question, what the future will hold for him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a shot she got the job of her dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already been looking for luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in London.
Young people leave: There are many families like the Tanners on the island.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, economic experts and the ESRI Institute for Social Research in Dublin predict.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A big loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, there is a similar wave of migration that the island suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great well-being to the Irish, the melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses above all the young, well-educated Irish, for whom so far, everything is upside down.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes and loses our country and with it an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future emerge because the government is only engaged in montages and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategies to achieve new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
Observe how your peers go from one unremarkable practice to the next.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
“For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career,” says the manager.
On their website are photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something somewhere else.
As there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish fellow builders in Germany.
They are now setting up a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to be able to pay a loan for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as it was a long time ago from the first time he stepped on the threshold of his house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
She laughs a little embarrassed and walks through icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with caring gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent funded by a loan.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O’Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, “I don’t have kids to feed and I’m young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch.”
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears today.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by any means, as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island,” he said.
“Working a season abroad isn’t the worst thing that can happen, maybe that makes us feel like Irish for the first time.”
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."

Let the future hang on and just see how life is elsewhere.
He's been working in London for a couple of years now, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend be fine in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him most: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he might degenerate into a farewell party.
“Just, not too many emotions,” he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Goodbye, it sounds very distressing."
"We'd better call it a walk-out party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine.
Support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies, continues to increase.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows for monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively mood prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the South American Pacific coast (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a sharp decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see graph 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same as last year, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they had confidence in their country's Congress and 45 per cent in their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it remained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year to 32 percent.)
However, moods vary considerably from country to country (see graph 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see graph 5).
About 31% say that, whether they or a close relative, have been victims of crime in the past year, a figure that has fallen from 38% last year and that is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private companies and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private companies are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (see graph 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of the same opinion (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% versus 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the trash
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they were far worse off than the foreigners who were trying to help the country recover from its problems feared.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown into the sewers, electoral colleges destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Electoral colleges opened hours late.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, were roaming the area trying to figure out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, declared that they were "relatively good elections in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautioned that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The playoffs are expected to take place in January.
All hope has not yet been lost in connection with the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition calling for the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has hardly any support, if any, has moved to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is sweeping the country and more than a million earthquake survivors are still living in stores, a major abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents needed to vote had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors believe that the choice of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And, as it has become clear, so do the Haitians themselves.
Pointing forward towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased its popularity index by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level since her election in 2007.
In spite of everything, that it can become a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez puts aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who was still in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of drafting budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the extra income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened since Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have confronted Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
The 2010 budget, therefore, will be implemented next year, giving the Chair an even greater margin of action when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, place it at about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had INDEC, the statistics institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez moderate these policies now?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the growth momentum achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason, Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is about to enter into an agreement with the creditor governments grouped together at the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not involve IMF oversight, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new index of prices to national consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the cleanup of INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez wants to continue in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have waned.
If you want to win another election, you will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, with peace of mind, many of your husband’s policies.
Half Hurrah for China
Voters in Taiwan are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, came in on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councilors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a champion of sentiment for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but for a short time.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to get the majority of votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has leaned toward total Taiwan independence, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it were the presidential elections, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s vote share has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the town halls.
In the elections, the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections could be seen, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and light-wearing girls dancing.
Nor was the mysterious attempt at murder rigor lacking.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to hurt Lien or avenge the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that this was not the issue of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China’s military threat.
Therefore, the KMT usually avoids publicizing its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma stated that it had been confirmed that his policy with respect to China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue bribing them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Certainly, he would also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
It is best to wait for the 2012 presidential election to pass.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on corruption charges.
President between 2000 and 2008, openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under Ms. Tsai’s leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been graciously welcomed as the PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything it can to show that he can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen interceding, the PPD will have difficulty choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also take a conscience test.
Mr Ma’s ratings have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing disparities between the rich and the poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says it will restructure its cabinet as well as local teams.
The PPD’s large samples suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, “the point of no return has already been crossed.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the Revelation Artist category.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys’ surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the Best Revelation Artist category.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Hope", the nomination gives some thought, but respects the Grammys' rules that it must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly represented a great breakthrough and, given his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, one can at least distinguish between Spalding and the path to Norah Jones's success in 2003, the closest category to the Gramy's last concentration.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored "Historicity" by Vijay Iyer Trio, an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a strident New Orleans favorite and regular guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise leans considerably toward fusion as on Stanley Clarke's, John McLaughlin's, and Jeff Lorber's albums.
Darcy James's wild punk Argue's Secret Society earned a well-deserved recognition in the big band category, competing against the big chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Director of Classic Albums
Classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo albums.
The Classic Producer of the Year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for the Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra; and the Synergy Symphonic Orchestra; the Boston Modern Orchestra's "Dreamhouse" of the Orchestra; and Synergy Sycri Vocals;
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Art National" by "The Enchanted Walker" and "The Enchanted Art National Walker".
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Passionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is dubbed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for him to play in Avi Avital mandolin, which performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
“He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral function category, for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists nominated include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees for vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The mosque proposed in Temecula gets the approval of the organizing commission
The mosque project for Temecula has gained unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and stalls.
However, members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
“Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Bah<0xC3><0xA1>’<0xC3><0xAD>s, from all religions,” Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said on Thursday morning.
“The truth is, as an American citizen, I’m proud.”
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
"Only they speak very loudly."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at six in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people interceding for or against the center, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“The United States no longer exists,” reads one comment.
"It's another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Freedom dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near zone zero, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families had been living seamlessly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it demonstrates that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That makes her something very peculiar, though little is missing to be a truly ‘alien’ kind of way of life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in Thursday’s online edition of Science.
For a long time, there are considered to be six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery “yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of “standard” elements that we consider essential to life may not be as fixed,” said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one by the other.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.”
"Consequently, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
“However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, to put it another way, appeals to biochemical machinery,” Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they were able to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic may naturally exist, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found that proves it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early eras of Earth, he noted, so the researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
“So it suggests that there could be other ways of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton.
The two missing dogs were found outside the Bellflower Motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said on Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Corgi Welsh Pembroke, went missing on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were spending the night in, in front of Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met late Wednesday night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They're back with their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
“An investigation is underway.”
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
“We’re following some leads.”
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found for comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered any damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit at the area’s competitions this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were going to exhibit in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the almost two-month tour that the couple makes by participating in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in to the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their room window.
They were carrying three other dogs (a boxer dog, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany), who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and they would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van theft on Tuesday at 6 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while MGM’s restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally got the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to wipe out approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and television shows.
Thursday’s ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to relaunch under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a small study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In reality, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument, to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The study’s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide management advice on how to manage its finances while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron Chairman and bankrupt business recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial tribulations and satisfy the study’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion the creditors were looking for.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially goes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper’s companies will receive multi-billion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company’s management services, will receive “successful fees” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on The Hobbit, along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to make a separate loan of between 265 and 275 million dollars to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of its gift budget
While the iPad is the top candidate to be this year’s most wonderful toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant bead in their gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes of $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three domestic toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year’s.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys powered by button batteries are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when their bellies are squeezed.
A pinch is equal to a note, and a second pinch begins to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start tightening, you can’t stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-shift games like Sim<0xC3><0xB3>m Dice, and can make the lunar pass, thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheels with locking device.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question letters designed to turn a car ride into a session with an on-going self-correction exercise notebook.
If you are reluctant to give your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games don’t teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years old), it’s the Leapster line’s first major set-up, with a newer, brighter display.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, 3- to 7-year-olds) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-block game just bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to arm words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it’s formidable for an improvised word-arming competition.
More and more are the toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based solely on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkins and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include skates on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of button-battery-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves quickly over 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It is also durable.

A more moderate side of law enforcement is promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing low-pitched orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, China’s urban order cops, feared and despised for their whimsical energetic measures and propensity to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Signed!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "how beautiful the girls are!"
Four girls who barely spent their teenage years wearing identical white gloves and olive green jackets and tight pants to get attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly above the hair tied with blue and white striped bows.
“Personally, I think they look normal,” Mr. Tang said, disdainfully.
“The models are beautiful.”
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating gazes: In 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a crumbling snack cart, and watched it with the eyebrows constantly crumbling for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, expressly elected for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the cowardly cop a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s little respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat a passerby to death after he used his cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the internet, describing how to effectively whip criminals without causing them to bleed.
This year, a traveling watermelon salesman in Shanghai suffered brain damage after a row with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar in the government,” lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for “really meticulous cleaning.”
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district solicited through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if women had actual duties or were simply a staged distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features."
They should have a height above average, over 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
“His image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities."
The female Chengguan are like vassals, he said, adding, "in addition to being vassals, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not anxious to back that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job ads for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, the disabled or disfigured should not show up.
“We can’t allow a picky person or a hummingbird to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his colored cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His co-worker with trenches, Xu Yang, 21, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also don’t object to their fixed-time work, they said, because they harbor bigger career ambitions than simply driving salespeople off the streets where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squadron faces roughly a dozen street vendors who launch themselves on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many buns or tofu bowls as possible before being thrown.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Ms. Xu as a salesman was escaping on foot, temporarily abandoning her bicycle-drawn carriage with noodle trims.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is more or less the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine".
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after false rumors spread that Chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen police or Chengguan officers were injured in the nighttime incident; 14 government vehicles were toppled or set on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calmness is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike shouted loudly.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with bad face, opened their way to the elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squad, stayed behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 years of age or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we struggle verbally."
“Sometimes we struggle physically,” Mr. Li said with total naturalness.
“Most of the time it’s the audience that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not bring charges against Senator Ensign
The senator’s attorneys announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Ensign’s office said it was “certainly pleased” with the decision, which came after a full year of investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plan to bring charges against him on this matter."
The Department of Justice declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have conflated to violate a federal criminal lobby ban.
The interviews, emails, and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get lucrative lobby work to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was barred under the law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared to disagree with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop prosecutions against Mr. Brand.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that laws don’t apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to bring charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got lobbying work thanks to Ensign's help with Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff John Lopez contacted Hampton and told him that he was "choking" the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the Transportation Secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator expected the ethics committee to quickly follow the Justice Department’s lead and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign has a desire to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire’s appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to come to an official end, with the death penalty judge’s imposition voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have filed papers in court outlining the arguments for appeals that will likely occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports about the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “an atmosphere of circus,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appellate judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“From what I experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual’s rights to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes’s senior defense attorney.
First-instance judge Jon C. Blue of the State Supreme Court laconically dismissed the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media were “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was led by passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that coverage of celebrated cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the TV show and the movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said the appellate courts that examined Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules may be needed to control the way of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media” on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and their daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of intense process coverage can attract most of the interest.
They noted in a rebuttal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media was continually burning the fire of emotion over the case.
“The daily agglomeration of tweets from the media, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state.”
His attention on Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly, was a ludicrous view that would make the court’s policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said the courts of appeal were often drawn to arguments about the adaptation that was required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In their letter, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which revoked Dr. Sheppard’s conviction because of the process’s coverage, and made it clear that they would demand that new media would require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century.”
Can civility provide a bridge to unite divisions?
After a notable campaign of invective and negativity, this week has unleashed a bit of civility in Washington.
Is it a foreshadowing of a genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick turn to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But as everyone says, it was at least a courteous discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to earn partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a trial period, polling each other to identify signs of cooperativeness and commitment, as they try to assess the limits of public opinion and voters’ patience for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent assessments of the same by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep-rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
The elections arouse partisan passions, which then extinguish.
That's good."
In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to broaden unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can’t make it believe they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism about a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
“After the things that have to be done are done, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to one of confrontation,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civility can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the 2012 main event," he said.
The motives have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who decisively contributed to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises of cutting state spending and overturning the new health law.
These lines of support are already clearly seen in initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include reforming the tax code and increasing some taxes and retirement age, and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that on tax issues there is, at least at present, little basis or desire for engagement.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans in the White House and those in Congress.
The first will take place next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and medical care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch the reaction of the people closely.
Anyone who thinks they are losing is likely to change course and seek engagement.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanism and polarization are now larger than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city’s control is in the hands of a “cleptocracy,” leaving a portion of the bribes and protection money it raises directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service run huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical authority,” takes its share as the money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said: "It's crazy, it's filthy, it's annoying."
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
“The direct links of the Moscow city government to crime have led some to call it ‘disfunctional,’ and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government,” the statement said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means 'roof' or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
“Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow’s criminal world.”
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS raises money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while fundraising is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly find their businesses closed by one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats,” Georgy Satarov, director of Indem’s Moscow expert group, said in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur until late Moscow time night, will surely cause displeasure within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we don’t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way.”
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge Forced to Face the Past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Khmer Rouge.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and cared for his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge government, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed the victims to publicly confront the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations-Cambodia mixed court issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentenced former head of the well-known torture center Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among Anlong Veng Red Khmer veterans, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can’t do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of Cambodia’s Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
“For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the Pol Pot-led government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the shallow soldiers remain poor and unqualified farmers.
"These people have made little profit after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
“They were raised with no concept of doing business.”
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine,” he said.
"Ta Mok fed them all."
“But now life is hard because we have to self-supply.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute the top leaders and those with the highest responsibility for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that is thought to have killed thousands of forced laborers.
During a recent muddy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields at his home on wooden piles on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry pasture, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She stated that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” he said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, even if experts and historians question it.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces," he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved 75-page textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea."
It was distributed at Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they’re not sure how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusted tin roof.
Pol Pot’s body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the side of the road, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot’s last rest, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of good luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its reserve of uranium qualified for armaments
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will relinquish its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations with Belarus had been carried out in the past two months to remove 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation nuclear security summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This demonstrates that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have conserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for armament) and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the low-enrichment uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that “this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen trust” that led to the deal signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-qualified uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh human rights repression.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential easing.
“While progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.”
The Spanish government did not make any repairs to the CIA flights
The Spanish government has not made any repairs to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners headed for Guantanamo by Spanish territory, the U.S. ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the government, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, asked that the Spanish executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised proper surveillance on foreign aircraft passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights abuses, a meeting took place between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no repercussions for intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "inadvertently pillaged," Aguirre says in a cable.
Also the then foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited capacity of influence".
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez conveyed to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge’s initiative to call for the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
“These reports contain no incriminating elements or any sensitive information,” the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern about “apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors,” rather than declassified information from the CNI or the defense ministry.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,” said Aguirre.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and the interior minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric".
The ambassador also expresses concern about the PP’s action on this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” he said.
The parrhicidal confessor complained on the network of the "agobium" of being a mother
The young woman was talking about the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which he used from a young age, he communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two naturals of Noia, the people of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a from which she comes.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of their relatives.
The 30-year-old Galician started a relationship in 1998 with Ivan T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist.
It lasted a year.
When they left him, it was soon known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
It was not long before he met another man.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the boy stayed with his partner, who even came to accompany her to Palma for a week.
But by the content of the communications, you can see that their romance broke, that they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and musketeed, because I have come to work."
“When I said it, he liked it, but of course, now he realizes what it’s like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
Then, talk about a message to the mobile you just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send to the child."
She complains: “If you don’t like me to leave the baby with my mother, I’ll pick it up when I get back,” she claims.
In May, he talks about his return to his village: "I'm going there this week, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to present myself to a job so as not to lose it."
He clarifies that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
“He’s going to be with who he owes, that is, me, and I’ll never think of leaving him with anyone but my mother again,” he said.
In July, there is another post.
When you type it, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly killed on the 10th, is dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
“On the one hand he’s with me and he likes the site a little bit, but on the other he’s going to class almost every day.”
Talk about a transfer to Mallorca.
“I’ll go there (the kid) to some summer classes, and so I save myself a little kangaroo paste.”
The 17th, Memories and Complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
Alberto says that he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck yourself.
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money".
On the internet there are his messages on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervening, where he was called "Muki the Prisoner."
"Terror a la gallega (ep<0xC3><0xAD>grafe)".
The last man who lived with her, she swears, declares her regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that it all happened because he didn't tell him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered yesterday the provincial prison of Palma, from the centre of judicial detainees of Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "nor intended to cause harm to the minor."
Before that, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and put his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and experienced deputies in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has a view on the generals because, whether advanced or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles that it receives in Catalan.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the generals of 2008, while in the regionals of 2006, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been nurtured by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now it has 25) and the PSC would lose nothing.
These calculations would confirm that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP – now it has three – while ICV would either stay with one MP or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relief at the head of the Diputaci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and popular agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the city councils of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - you need to get 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can take the lead in the upheaval in the Tarraconense capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has been placed only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Popular have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the General Police Information Police Office in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba's 10 dead" (Lat.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that the “Operation Kampai” has “weakened” Al Qaeda’s counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and, therefore, “its operational capability”.
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to groups that make up the criminal Al Qaeda galaxy so that its “fighters” can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, therefore, in addition to Thai services, other European police units have participated in the investigations, so it is not ruled out that in the EU territory similar blows are carried out in the next few days as developed on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis were arrested Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand, Butriy Buthan and the other Buthan were developed with the capture of the paqui.
These were the ones who led from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
At the moment, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency some thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by members of the "command" that ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized ample documentation.
The PP requires Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas to his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and without any adventures the filio-sovereignist wants the national leader, as he is with the
The president of the popular Catalans came to the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that he has obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make himself wanted, as the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the investiture vote.
On a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress when holding general elections, but, for the time being, the conversations that Mas holds these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an investiture "all sovereignist and independentist speeches will have to be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the converging leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to slimming the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiations on the investment of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciudadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their guard killed more than 11 elderly
The officials of the geriatrician La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while working there killed at least eleven elderly people in his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the indictment against the person responsible" for the deaths, but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
In addition to the social disdain that the entity may suffer for not detecting the criminal activities of the jailer in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that are already being calculated by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then she has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrician - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was carried out by phone.
La Caritat, through its director, strongly denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “there is not a single indication in the case that there has been reckless action by anyone other than the defendant himself.”
The man, already dubbed “Angel of Death,” confessed to 11 murders yesterday and said the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by shoveling an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by using a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the center's staff have access to medicines.
The insulin shots and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his quest to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being carried out in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they give no credibility to the demonstrations of the jailer, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet’s threat yesterday that warned “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral spreads have closed sharply and shares of European banks have risen more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely risen, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses recovers but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded that the ineffective public debt purchase plan be terminated and that all extraordinary liquidity measures be eliminated on time, leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect you to continue with your bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, may God help us!
As at their May meeting in which they claimed they had not even contemplated buying bonds and the markets collapsed, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, he announced the bazuca on Monday and Wednesday said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday the one-year letter auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only $500 million at 5.28%, compared to $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment following Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole figures have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion short-term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to get private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumable within the aid plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval for its new budget and it still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a focal point of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease tensions in the face of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14th in which a political commitment is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity when he presented yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four stations of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and strong and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we expect it to resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for a help plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available three times as much as in March, at very expensive rates and closes access to the markets sine d<0xC3><0xAD>e.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being so, it seems so".
Good luck, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm does not delay in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "zero of full right", the judiciary board of El Enebro next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to make use of the majority and get to the management bodies of the firm that holds Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for control on the part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services to the company does not seem willing to yield in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was disenfranchised by five of his seven children who were appointed directors at this year’s shareholders’ meeting on January 18 and whose challenge is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantil N<0xC3><0xBA>mero 2 in Madrid, has opened again the box of thunder within the Alvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate appeal from applicants to their five children to, through procedural cunning, in clear fraud of law and abuse of law, try to validate and sanitize the radically null junta of January 18," according to his official.
This argument will be the basis on which, once the meeting is held, it will proceed to challenge it as it is considered to be "zero of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a joint-stock company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez’s seven children control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group, however, claims the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This issue is the substantive question that the judge must decide once the hearing on the appeal is held, for which there is still no date specified.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret Siemens gun
A software designs improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one considered the options of a newly arrived squad and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship all bet on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without sacrificing his ability as the driver of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula One has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing plants around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable failures and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement “in a few hours, almost in real time”, the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team today employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications in the vehicles.
The CEO of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull's vehicles with the exception of the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological refinement is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its vehicles in a locality about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The staff for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull’s Formula One, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety is null.
The factory’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in trolley cars contributed 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the drivers contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computers as they are “unpredictable gladiators.”
HP will install 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will reconcile this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set an example of the refurbished store located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes all 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP Personal Systems also assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and manages the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff at the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-leading pilot program that is in charge of solving possible problems with HP’s warranty computer equipment.
An online service connects to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
“This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have technical assistance services contracted,” said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell Bets on ‘Stealing’ One Million Customers from His Rivals in Three Years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
In spite of this, it foresees a decline in interest margins, which will be compensated in part by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to attract one million private clients in three years, his outstanding subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 that will have a three-year duration.
The goal, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to FROB’s public aid, is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers – 700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted – its great outstanding subject, as it had so far pampered more SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when it presents the results of the financial year.
Few banks at this time dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its Optima management plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made it expand one more exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a “difficult and transcendental” year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the debt war – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and crates are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity are already shifting to the price of credit to offset the drop in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it’s going to be a factor of pressure on credit.”
"We haven't closed the faucet, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto already on Thursday gave orders to its network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of the spreads - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as on November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend is now "raising commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says, that in Spain "larger sizes will be required."
“Next year everything will move,” he said.
It claims that capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institution enters in red numbers.
And he points out that FROB can supply the market in fundraising in the face of new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through rests, which dampens the crisis.
ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrita, ruled out a wave of savings bank mergers yesterday and re-emphasised the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When he started the process of concentrating the Spanish savings banks, it was several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Confederaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ola de Cajas de Ahorros (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrita, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
“I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are adjustments.”
“Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in that as well,” he said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Arag<0xC3><0xB3>n (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the process of concentration is taking place "at the fastest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the deadlines that in his day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
“Going from 45 boxes with an average asset volume of 28.5 billion to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process unprecedented in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrita said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and “probably” in the world, and attributed to those who question it a “lack of knowledge”.
The director pointed out that, in the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes at the fastest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking came out very well stopped from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of unemployment assistance without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How are these movements to be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries in breach, possible suspensions of payments from some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government pulled a constitutional reform from the sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (fiscal rigor and stability plans in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully lengthened Greece’s bailout decision.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the EU treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should be attending the Union reform process that makes those measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if measures have to be taken now with which he may not quite agree, from that date the old functioning of the euro will have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which infringing countries will be severely penalized, may be forced to declare themselves on suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, like the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, simply won’t tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd hurt if we didn't understand.
It is not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand from us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will leave room for greater tranquility.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his twofold manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that order must be put at home has opened the way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn’t look like they’re going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of leaving a monetary zone too crowded with low-serious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sports and Law Fraud
Tretas like those of Alonso and Ramos before Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The alleged expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink to be written about whether such behavior is anti-sporting and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in making several fouls to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
That way, and since Real Madrid will end up as the leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next game of the league, against Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee has sanctioned the team’s coach José Mourinho with two games and different financial amounts to the players involved.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the case reported is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and which in past times has fined its players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds a more technical episode to his dilated history.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit fraud; indeed, they are actions respectful of the sport regulation, but they seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question arises from examining the type of damage they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the goods that the sporting spirit understands is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put in jeopardy, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets referred to with fair play is to prevent the team of the offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that they did not accommodate to what we normally characterize as cheating or law fraud, since their violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but precisely their action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders gain in the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to establish that the opponent is not placed in a disadvantageous situation or gains in the same game, since obviously the result of the action means leaving the team with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated at the first changes, and in addition with this performance the players meet a penalty match and move to the second round of cards, in which the suspension for card accumulation occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, going through rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor the maximum benefit from what the rules allow.
In the case we are concerned with, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of fraud of the law), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without bypassing the punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the line between ingenuity and fraud is blurred, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the directive to provoke them was carried out.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture the Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The calendar dictatorship is concentrating an avalanche of reserves for the 16th and 17th days this year.
Self-supporting celebrations are proliferating for employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turr<0xC3><0xB3>n and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to act as an oxygen ball for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to catch the majority customer: almost all want to spend the dinners in between 20 and 30 euros.
To finish complicating accounting, this year’s calendar (falling New Year’s Eve on Friday) has concentrated petitions in the week of December 13, with the result to date an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and barely moving for the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean cow stage began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to deprive of tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both sides demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Barcelona Restoration Guild, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to predict how the festivities of this month will be.
"People think about it long before booking."
“He wants to go out but he has the alerts on the price issue,” he said.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to lower a step with the crisis, so that the band around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey of several central establishments found the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is a real boom of applications for that Friday, with the pretense of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early bookings, even since early November.
“We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes ranging from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they detail.
At AN Grup, which flags El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and a total of 23 locations, they remain optimistic after detecting a rise in turnover from the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who precede the parties.
To its six group menus have added one Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green buds in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts to start seeing the end of the tunnel and argues that together the reservations are "animated", although customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is, the illusion for the festivities has not descended, pay who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises serious concerns in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at “a faster rate than any other country.”
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security, rather than going up, “decreases”, and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster pace than any other.”
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program — that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy in the event of an attack — is one of the main reasons for unraveling in Washington.
Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson said in a report prior to the visit of then-National Security Advisor James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transportation of atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferative and motive for keeping the watch.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programs," U.S. Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his counterparts.
The latest in the documentation leaked by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the Pakistani high rate of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which described communication with Pakistan as “frustrating,” said: “Transparency is often non-existent; offers of help are left unanswered or dismissed.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make “very clear” to the person responsible that “the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups.”
On the hunt for the Wikileaks chief
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorist official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and track Assange’s movements.”
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Also, it is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks creator Mark Stephens’ lawyer says that “police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
It was on the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Interpol’s 188 countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange “with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as the organization has explained, do consider the so-called "notice free network" to proceed to an arrest -- which must be carried out by the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where it is believed to be.
The move has outraged Assange’s lawyers, who published a letter yesterday denouncing the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder’s willingness to respond by videoconferencing to questions from Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange applied for and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
“This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him – and from Australia his mother defends her son’s innocence – Assange remains in unknown but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an indeterminate interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, it should resign,” he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation petition “ridiculous and absurd.”
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior anti-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with views these days proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to intervene and their funds and prosecute anyone who gives them any contribution or assistance.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has had to resign after saying Assange should be “killed.”
“Obama should make it a target and use a drone or something.”
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment,” he said.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in ERC with nods to those related to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found the recipe to bypass the eleventh internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without a north for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his resigning hideout is insufficient for the likes of former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is now as diluted as his own mentor and that it can at all cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to win over the new critics with nods that will allow him to arm himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC councillors will be able to comment on its continuity in secret.
By paperwork, not by hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would also not be a good result "to the Bulgarian".
The neighbors to Carod demand the president something more than to make his office available to the militants, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have enough majority to force their resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which the management will submit to the national council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to endorse Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s promising to advance the congress to autumn 2011, something the summit already assumes.
The ERC leader acknowledged that the “polyphony” harms stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash dirty cloths from doors inwards.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the acting councillor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, the innovator assumed that the leader would be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militants, that is, to include new faces coming from the Carod-related sector.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assemblyism as a functioning mechanism.
Thus, he advocated a reform of the statutes that would allow congresses to be held through delegates elected by vote.
To end the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave left the task of reviewing assemblyism at a specific congress to reform statutes.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged dealing with the matter.
Now, without critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to take it back and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the contents of MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are the murder of three women and the discovery of a pair of carved bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year there are 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a corpse found in San Diego of the Fathers Cuexcontittl<0xC3><0xA1>n, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearm shots and grace shot in the head in addition to his feet and hands tied with wire.

In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency bodies conducted a thorough search of the other body members, however they were not located.
Neighbors in Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n warned of the discovery of a corpse in the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada area, which was tied with his hands back and with his head bandaged.
The man had a gunshot wound to his neck.
In mid-month, the execution of two men was reported, who were wrapped in blankets and left in the casket of a vehicle in the streets of the fractionation Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of warnings of death.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found dead in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning was located the body of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow blanket with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Rios he according to a message that his ecuje
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman were detected tattoos of the Holy Death, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the latter part of the month, the body of a man was found aboard a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet strikes and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a pair of men with their heads engorged and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who don't line up."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tying of feet and hands, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the colony of San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n Blade colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon ribbon and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag on the streets of the Juarez Colonia.
Next to him the officers found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, his country has invested $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this issue.
He noted that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four headings: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programs.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set as regards the reduction of gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities, to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
In addition, it abounded, are in progress or have already concluded various multi-annual plans, both funded by the Chinese government, and by governments of other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficient Use Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and which received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent spotlights to savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific advisor on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he explained, per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do another both by 2020.
Attached to the legality of Espino's expulsion: César Nava
The national leader of the NAP detailed that the former Panist leader was entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what was appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the NAP, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former Panist leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what suits his right.
In an interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to go, if necessary, via a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the scope of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy has never been on the negotiating table.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez said he was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional will emerge strengthened from the internal election on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
“That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal,” he said.
The Panist leader said that the NAP is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; the story "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he said.
He said that the council will certainly know how to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence it will hand over the racket "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the rebound that the party registered in the last July 4 elections will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it's not time yet to think about 2012."
"For now, it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the reason for observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, longings are placed on them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his speech during the four years of his government, César Nava called on the Priists to reflect on the sexenios of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n; let them start defending them; let them get out of the closet,” he said.
He said that the head of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no jaw-dropping or much less censorship in the country.
Obama promotes Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization today in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link to a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with senators, given that the vote on the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other drafts such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he hoped that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the bills.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
“I think we can reach an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would call for a "debate-closing vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on Thursday in the Senate, though it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the American Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have stayed in the country for the past five years, and have entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the initiative, so they require the contest of a handful of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations are leading an intense lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act require adding several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have said they will not back it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the wound
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where the participants gala narration
"That of The sex in the language I understand but... the finger in the wound? what is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time he used the subtitle of his question (in another fair the table sexon the network).
The finger on the wound... "sets us in a tight spot", sweetly shoved the Argentine writer to the public, mostly young people, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Mayra Montero Lui.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "wreck" is, goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not get answers, although she does get clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist comes the conviction: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who clarifies that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and the traps of the tongue must be very glimpsed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also exhibited a delightful narration titled Praise of the Invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at one point is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, the story of a famous sorceress, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that came to speak later America, the great novel to which he did not miss from the beginning his own chroniclers who told them by quoting the critics that they excelled Bernal.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that was lacking to their shame."
However, he emphasized that "it is the madmen and the ambushers who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that what is narrated belongs to one side or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
In fact, it is called the "Cervantine tradition".
“By his heritage we are what counts.”
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero praised and applauded the variety of interpretations that resulted in the invitation of the FIL with her round table The finger on the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed her towards the great plague of social violence that is passing through her country -and shares Latin America - the product of the disputes of the trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs entail a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose intervention also emphasized "that finger on the wound of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
“To be masters of our thinking and to be masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance often means putting your finger on the wound and annoying those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also annoying the powers that prefer a world in black and white,” he said, inviting to reco
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who meet each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up consoling himself with the medal of the runner-up, he has been a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he took the reins of Morelia with which he fell 4-2 overall against Toluca; subsequently, in Clausura 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with 3-1 overall and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Devils, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team ended up tied 2-2 against the runners after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he put himself in the lead by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally 11 players his 3 fouls.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore he does not want to run the same luck, seeks to break away from the curse and be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he says that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," the helmsman said when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very current has the previous final, from which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw already we were ready to leave the game running and I think that is not even a party".
Knowing that this series could be defined in penal shots, something that does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "One never tries to get to the set of penalties, one tries to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately we got a bad game of fate, sometimes we are nervous about it,
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-champion coach and try for the first time the glory that the titles give.
I changed the rules to get a visa.
Individuals will need to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview at the Consular Section; the cost will be lower as well as the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, it will change the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will need to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASCs) before their Consular Section interview.
ASC staff will take the biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another more for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a one-time payment covering all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for cases of visas on request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for merchants and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will remain at the ASC for less time than in the past.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency cited the press to present a finding tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will unveil an astrobiological discovery on Thursday that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as the one in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
In a statement, NASA said it would present “a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life,” prompting speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures on our side and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and from this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will unveil the true scope of the findings at Thursday’s press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it leads to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in the Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, from Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, from the PRD; and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, were 'throning' against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it starts "bipartisanism", because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He said that in the next few days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and this ended the opposition coalition.
“So far it has come, that’s what I’m looking at, because we’re excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, from Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he went on, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopoly".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipatism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other peers and comrades to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress has become a 'booty' between two, in reference to the PAN and PRI.
“It used to be just one game, now they’re splitting it between two.”
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That not by cupular agreements, left out to 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, now to the five that see us, separated in different factions, we have decided to unite to seek a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they did that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
200,000 more dollars for "supplier"
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n City Council pays another check to the questioned electrical equipment company owner.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts to be paid".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks are missing to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought, it’s just being paid what it owes, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks “reappeared” in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Gazette of the State, as indicated by the Act when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasury said that they have not used their services again.
The above, after on July 25, Noroeste published a review of the cheques issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the three-year term of the Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 42 million to the Municipality.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgency to attend tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs lament foreign tourist accident due to poor conditions of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asked authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a poor image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reversed the bad that tourists encounter with new activities or routes.
He said the poor state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and get back to nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a company one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, or else they wouldn’t do the works in this way for so long and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it by giving preventive maintenance and not just fall into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be given maintenance, but as residents we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Mazatlan Venadite.
"Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
“The attention has not been given and this kind of facts highlights something that is notorious by everyone, maintenance is needed.”
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Deputy Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n is urgent, as they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, tidy and attractive because it is of touristic vocation.
“Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination.”
Asks for IP results from Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, president of the CCE, proposed that deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A legislature worthy of work and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature was installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which adds a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that do not repeat the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly-released 40 deputies of the State Congress take on the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies will actually exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to safeguard their own interests and become carnival comrades of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why he talked about certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that will advance the Governor in turn.
“We are concerned that they come to do a worthy job and above all, they are committed to society and to sectors because it was the Sinaloa people who gave them the vote of confidence in the last election.”
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation.”
As for the tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight he bears within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretary.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruent as an important economic activity that generates foreign exchange and investment and that directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for tourism projects that are detonating and that help in giving security to the state and in updating the Alcohol Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Looking for a magician
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For her parents, the next King’s Day will be hard to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a duck.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the Colonia Salvador Allende and live up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Because sometimes we see it hard because my husband has no chamba, but we sell mandarin and papa... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, Jose Alfredo, 10, has long aspired to have a ‘monster’ car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster,' but I said 'Let's see son,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children, those who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, wears size eight.
Jose Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the campaign Seeking a Magician King, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and production equipment have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke Palace of Justice within hours of their arrest.
They could face allegations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a lengthy investigation that has lasted about a year.
“It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the arrests,” Mr. Ruel said.
About seventy officers from the Quebec Security Estrie investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Department were involved in this police operation.
It will be able to fight illegal migration without problems
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should solve the problem of paternalism charged with illegal migrants, is likely to face major opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the letter."
"I find myself here with a party that has created the granite you step on," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by lawmakers after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone to be detained for up to a year from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not back the bill because it targets the wrong target.
“We are against it and, it seems, all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing,” Duceppe said.
The NDP’s criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has vehemently rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree that action is being taken against the custodians of clandestine paternity and that’s what we intend with another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and jails children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they don’t tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada, and that they treat the country like a pimp.”
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Kenney.
The government has not announced a confidence vote on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each MP who is going to oppose would later explain himself to his voters.
The new unit does not get unanimity
Although Jean Charest had announced the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, numerous observers continued to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation on this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday’s announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It can be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services held on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for Quebec's public safety critic Stéphane Bergeron to call this announcement "a rabbit pulled out of the joker" and "a last-minute tricky solution."
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” he says.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ president Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
“The more stubborn Mr. Charest is in avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the intervener general to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the intervener general,” he concludes.
It also believes that Quebec could give the intervenor the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only ongoing project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request seems to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in this regard.
During the spring 2001 operation related to biker groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently spurred the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a precautionary measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Additionally, an additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, Quebec’s civil security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and of the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, security adviser Annik Bouchard said.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Centre, for its part, issued announcements on Wednesday communicating the growing strengths of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partially Blame Dupont
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as for his rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Council also indicated that the debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received a number of complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts made between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision came after a complaint from the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were incorrect.
Presenters should communicate reliable data and not misleading.
In connection with the suicide, the presented Stéphane Dupont had stated that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes called into question of 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any guilt in this regard has been dismissed.
The latest litigation concerned statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure if the needy were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
“My file has been clean for a year and a half,” the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the radio channel CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, who must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of the largest audience within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai boxing, climbs the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance to the professional level.
“In my case, I’m looking for combat everywhere because for those who don’t enjoy the ground-based mixed martial arts game, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship, held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and thai boxing,” he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four positions in the last World Championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place".
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009."
“The interesting thing is that I’ve been progressing in every competition.”
"At this step, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originally from China in which it is allowed to hit with fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal only has to maintain a competition in his career, he will certainly attend the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
“This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China,” explains the friendly boy.
“It’s like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand’s largest stadium).”
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“He who has won me is a true professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face off in the final of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management contract, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Party of Quebec, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and provoke a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition.”
“I mean, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly,” party deputy Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he claims, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was a collusion with this contract.
“I’m starting to get tired,” he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a “dishonest” and “lack of rigor” way.
He noted that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
Work has already begun and will continue until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without competition being involved; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the formula of the consortia has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of consortia in the technical advice sector is being investigated by the Government.
A quick look at Quebec’s trade register allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, the company Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, that is, Dessau.
As for the Energy Management consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to a particular workforce dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
“If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher.”
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and say to them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
“However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but people’s competition,” Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has hinted that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped the fact that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which “finance” it, before specifying that it is rather about its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The label "green" does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade marks or eco-certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, the first results of which were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe through which they hover messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows down their commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates that carry the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are "co-responsible," the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take the speeches of politicians on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and dubious nature of the information make 46% of consumers reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of the supposed yields of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food grown in their region, the Barometer notes.
Greener and more responsible (the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 points out of a maximum of 100 this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to take the place of the king of recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be doors (from your car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or have shared cars to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this wide-ranging behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, support bicycle use and walking.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after Société Angus and El Parallele, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallele, who were expecting a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on boulevard Saint-Laurent and return him to his true cinematic vocation, have not gotten what they were asking for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would, in fact, be lower than initial expectations; this could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then the requests have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a final report about ten days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
Parallele and Angus have until December 31 to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a state donation should be completely discarded.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Film Complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector do claim considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the film, has been carrying the burden of authoring for ten years on his premises in the complex, after financing its own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to loyalize its clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing for a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallele, continues to screen films on eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, screening Xavier Beauvois's precious film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals they have received.
The veil of complex Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers the complex of Canadians with respect to Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter’s sense of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, during the full federal election campaign, recounts to what extent the United States is not getting into the issues debated by political leaders.
This surprised the U.S. ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority practically inherent to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Accordingly, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this choice: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“Logically, the ability of a candidate, of a party, and even more so of a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when it comes to voting.”
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the government’s survival during the February vote of confidence on the federal budget, whereby Canada will for the first time record a deficit in the last decade due to a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery plan,” Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to prolong parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition from being replaced or that opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communiqué signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image broadcast by the U.S. CBC drama series.
The ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which subtly references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable says that, during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to host some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but that it depended "on each case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, “He has handed over a document to the Secretary of State in relation to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods in relation to the WikiLeaks site have warmed up.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, told CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
In the United States they echo Mike Huckabee.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
The United Nations has proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount that corresponds to almost one-third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED"), much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted to the planet would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary automotive fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that amount should be further reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the rise in temperatures by two degrees centigrade to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced by two times.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
On top of that, they don't contain any mercury.
A number of experts have expressed their reservations regarding fluorescent light bulbs, as they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put instructions.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not fluo-compact bulbs, but coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted from incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the benefits that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the “immediate” publication of the results of the presidential elections in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire, given that the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General highlights the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“Ask all Ivory Coast parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission has allowed Wednesday’s deadline to pass at midnight without the results being published, three days after Sunday’s poll.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had commented on television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there have been multiple calls for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, Gbagbo's side has been counting on the Constitutional Council's annulment of "fraudulent" votes in the north, at the hands of the former New Forces (FN) rebellion since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager for the Ivory Coast president, said the intimidation of voters by the UN in the north had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be voided if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo’s complaints.
However, Gbagbo’s opponents believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northerner who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has deemed the delay in the publication of the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have set the stage for the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the political class in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round on October 31, with 38% of the vote against Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) data published by the Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population on the mainland and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and seek employment or not.
The situation of young people present in the labor market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
On the other hand, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older people, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points both in three months and in one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with the DOM.
Unemployment has only been stable among people aged 25 to 49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
The Insee has been running since 2006 without publishing the monthly unemployment rate, after a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October, after a 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne General Council, is being investigated and has been jailed in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking of influences and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions that the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night, they began investigating and also jailed one of their close associates, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done is take care of the landfills he has to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to the lawyer Simon.
As part of this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, has also been under investigation since Wednesday for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but he has been released on probation and is forbidden to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
“The instructor magistrate has taken account of the explanations and has released him,” his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, said.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, they interrogated four other people and released them, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) property, has been charged with “trafficking influences and passive corruption.”
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated for "theft and misappropriation of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and for "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “covering up the abuse of social property.”
Among the people who have faced Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect their societies have served to whitewash the capital of great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several court orders initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that the research focuses especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: The Elisha has exaggerated Syria’s mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has kept the public in France in a state of turmoil, warned of diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of walkers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the crude reality of how the French presidency attempted to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram issued in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
The Elysee’s strategic affairs adviser, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by Quai d’Orsay’s director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly detained in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continuously release” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate release.”
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more often.”
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discrete channels are exhausted, “silence will solve nothing,” the Iranians are “experts in delaying maneuvers.”
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a customary Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros in reward).
In addition, he notes that the Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that “is going to increase.”
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he says.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but is locked up in Iran.
The following information is being disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iran’s clandestine nuclear-procurement networks, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Freeing the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
The Elisha, he says, not only “has been greatly surprised by the judge’s decision,” but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot annul the decision" judicial, he says.
Mr. Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of French intelligence services.
The adviser of the Elysee marks a phone number, hangs it, and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee does not spare in efforts, uses organized press releases and “leaks” to make it believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an “important” and “influential” role as a “mediator.”
Americans observe this activity with some irony and verify that the manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles broadcast the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the reason for such “gratitude” towards Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done.”
Next, the document deals with the reasons that led Elisha to give way to this fiction.
The major communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he said.
A policy started in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been spotted premature and unworthy."
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris is trying to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided in him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we thanked him."
“At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received her at the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an “active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot.”
Starting at midnight, young Koreans can’t play online
The South Korean government is going to pass a law called “Cinderella” that will prevent teens from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under 16 years of age, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day.”
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” Jo Rin, the minister in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games when the parents of young people so request, the official added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow you to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the organizing countries
Amid a storm of suspicions of corruption, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday appointed the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere in the African continent in 2010, or to continue with its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidatures have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of their country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the bonfire on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has highlighted three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass British officials, who have launched intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The Head of Government hopes to reissue the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, which he had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the JJ.OO. 2012.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain the brilliance of England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the duo Spain-Portugal also has numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World Cup 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they can do is give points to Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadions, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the accusations of the English press against the EC members.
"They're pulling out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to be the most logical favorite.
As the world’s leading economic power and home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, fiercely desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One mandate in the Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence does not combine well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential office.
Therefore, it should always appear that it is doubted.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the deputies of the UMP, on Tuesday night in the Elysee, the possibility of "two terms" has caused some turmoil.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president merely indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It simply conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has talked about presidential elections, with a joking tone, in meetings of this kind.
"At worst, or better, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't think what will come next."
His statements of yesterday do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
There are comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal has come to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Quite the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to demand that the battle be organized sooner than expected.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon’s candidacy to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the issue," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and cautiously.
“If you think you can lose, you will not be a candidate,” says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“He will always think he can win,” corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB is forced to keep its State Letters acquisitions
The latest meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to clarify the modalities of exit from the crisis or at least announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that are expected to end by the end of the year.
Due to the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Issuing Institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so pertinent if it does not want to risk aggravating a more complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde endorsed the ECB’s active role in solving the European countries’ debt crisis.
He did not want to say whether he felt the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its program of buying government bonds.
“I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans.”
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the program of buying State Letters in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see" during the juimos of what it says.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main invariant rate at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to close to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, he would have bought Irish and Portuguese securities again yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired securities amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is little doubt that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not anticipate any significant change in direction.
Although longer than three-month lending operations have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on beneficial terms and durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
“I don’t think he’s going to significantly change his program.”
“If not, it would run the risk of triggering new tensions in the short term,” says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“It seems more likely that a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 will occur,” predicts Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of such bonds in order for the market to remain stable,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It must compensate at any cost for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the yields paid by the most fragile states,” said a senior bond manager.
Because, if interest rates are set in the clouds, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi copes with the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
On the eve of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti calling the situation "indecipherable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached the record 210 basis points and the price of hedge contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing a certain upheaval in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, expressed “deep concern” about “market turbulence” and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, their problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the government deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures should be taken," said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts are in good shape, as we have been saying for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries,” said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
There remains the problem of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period that would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis would be opened.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already reiterated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already shown on Sunday, at night and by day, that Europeans are clearly in solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although it was relative, yesterday’s relaxation in the rates of European states’ obligations has boosted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower the rating of Portugal's debt, the most frequent target at the moment of speculation.
“As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which significantly weighs on banking systems,” economists at Exane BNP Paribas say.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, European countries are stepping up discussions to strengthen existing mechanisms to exit the crisis.
Informal consultations between Finance Ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The next item is the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its CEO, Klaus Regling, has begun a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issuance of EAFRD securities is expected to take place next month.
A U.S. official told Reuters yesterday that the United States would support a potential increase in mobilized funds through a further direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries that are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, these prepare to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are added to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
They both want to avoid, at all costs, requesting international aid before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they deem essential in order to build confidence in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalistic partners of the European funds consider the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of the public bond markets.
Passing through Paris, on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to retake the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe an additional amount of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
There is an instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which is currently endowed with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
A council that could undoubtedly examine European capitals in detail.
Especially if the market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfalls continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the <0xC3><0x8E>le de France.
Snow layers between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France and Lemosin.
The snowfall is strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads for heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend not to drive unless necessary and the circulation of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
On Thursday, school transport in Picardy was banned.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy Paris airport and 10% in Orly on Thursday because of the planned snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers get in touch with their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the island of France has reached its high point, billions have been raining.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro that the Société du Grand Paris must build.
To start this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
In theory, this sum will be the one that will subsequently allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 amending Finance Act, reviewed in the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two modes: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the office tax on the Island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The proceeds of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate such an increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's far from $4 billion.
“It is necessary that the tax resources are added to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of the allocation of funds that will be mobilized by the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,” we read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
“From the moment revenues are created, we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the $4 billion later, as we explained.”
"It will be recorded in the budget and used as needed."
The SGP estimates that it will start receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion pledged are not included in the credit, can provoke a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Revenge Hackers and Diligent Spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and predicts a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who are engaged in occultism not only trust in what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The reporter is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, the editor of the Libération), who considers only what he can recognize to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the U.S. Embassy from Rome to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the previous week.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State can call by phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have become centers of espionage.
Any viewer who sees research films knows it perfectly, we just seem that we don’t know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secretive country in the world’s most powerful country significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "deceivers".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, he could be conceived of in every way as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer even keep its own secrets endure?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, no secret, since it comes from the public realm; but to reveal, as has been done by WikiLeaks, that all secrets are meant by Clinton.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on such a powerful power?
It is obvious that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put on the network any confidential information, since it would be like publishing it on a poster in the middle of the street.
But it’s also clear that with current technologies, you can’t expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than figuring out if and when a Head of State has moved by plane and contacted one of his counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the time being, my prediction is a matter of science fiction and therefore novel, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at most, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then stored, in a single copy, in locked drawers: ultimately, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a wired telegraph (telephone).
The (analog) videotapes had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, uncovering all the secrets of editing, while now the (digital) CDs only allow you to move forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travel it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques bring us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly going on in the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s dips in its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the fast-start or early funding promises made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French hoodies have been unveiled.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was appreciable and appreciated for what it really is: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track to meet its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what “new and additional” means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Currently, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken the year 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years as fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" from 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to previous years' expenditures or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while it pretends to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro borrowed is equivalent to a donated euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is wrong to present a euro that is to be recovered as the equivalent of a euro that is given... At most, only the interest rate of the loan should be calculated for its commitments (the pre-lending country).
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it "respects" its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million commitment by making 91.5% of loans (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>389.8 million) and 8.5 % of donations (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million); see the EU document to see for yourself.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, in its fast-start financing, France performs a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending just <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, he manages to give the impression that he spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million “new and additional”, as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a minor, relatively short-term one, in relation to the whole of the climate negotiations.
But it could be a grain of sand too much in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could push forward the debates on stakes in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter that is currently being debated): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additional character" and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to advance the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Générations Futures association (the former movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value given the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem," acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a child usually consumes about ten years old in four meals and one snack a day.
These model meals, which follow official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
“Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrisome,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green jews in Kenya, including in food, where the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even the bread bar or gum were clad with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most “nutritive” with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk these “contaminant cocktails” pose to the consumer is “probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "against the gravity of the situation" to implement a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the rise of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 were in cereals.
