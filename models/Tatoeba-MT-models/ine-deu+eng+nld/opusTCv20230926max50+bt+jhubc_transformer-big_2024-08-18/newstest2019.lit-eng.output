MG Baltic case: Gustaini's new lawyer says he has not yet been able to access the file
At the eleventh trial of MG Baltic on Monday, all the defendants gathered: <0xC5><0xA0>ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Vytautas Gab<0xC5><0xA1>ys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the testimony of the defendants.
At the last court hearing, the state-appointed new lawyer of S. Gustaini, Alexander Doroshev, told the College of Judges that he had not yet been able to access the file.
At the time, Linas Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, a lawyer at MG Baltic, said that in order to ensure full personal defence, the Judiciary should allow the new lawyer to access the case material and asked to postpone the court session.
"In order to ensure the defence of a person, he must have access to the material of the criminal case.
This is not just a formal sitting,” said L. Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius.
The new lawyer A. Doro<0xC5><0xA1>ev noted that he was unable to access either the indictment or the entire file.
At a previous court hearing, the suspect, Mr Gustainis, announced his lawyer’s resignation because he would no longer be able to pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard at the meeting.
The defendants’ lawyers are outraged that the audio recordings submitted to the court are of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, by taking bribes from MG Baltic, have supported or initiated decisions favorable to the group in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as influenced the decision-making of the winners of public procurements, ELTA recalls.
During the pre-trial investigation, more than 150 persons were interviewed, of which more than 50 were past and current Seimas members, several former ministers, and members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 sprints were conducted.
It is suspected that S. Gustainis received a bribe of more than 8,000 euros, G. Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius - 15,000 euros, V. Gap<0xC5><0xA1>ys - more than 27,000 E. Masiulis is suspected of taking a bribe of more than 106,000 euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and smuggling, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, smuggling and smuggling, and MG Baltic is suspected of smuggling and smuggling these parties.
It is suspected that the politicians consulted with the vice president of the MG Baltic group R. Kurliansky on bribes, and later proposed or supported initiatives in the Seimas or other institutions that were favorable to the group.
Ethical Guards: Liberal Movement Board on the right to conduct the Vilnius chapter
"The decisions taken by the government are in accordance with the statutes," its head Vytautas Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas told BNS after the commission meeting.
“This decision was not a new one.
We had already made an explanation as a commission in the month of July, when the question of the Pah<0xC4><0x93>gi<0xC5><0xB3> and Utena was raised.
We then said that, according to the statutes, this is a matter of the competence of the Board.
And if the board decides that a section can do as it pleases - go with the committee and the board agrees, then the section can go, but if the board decides that everywhere there will be party lists, what the board has adopted, then it is a decision that all the sections form parties.
And if you disagree with the board, then there is an opportunity to suspend membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to Tamoshi<0xC5><0xAB>nas, the party's board will now decide on further action.
On October 17, the Liberal Movement Board canceled the decision of the Vilnius City Department to participate in municipal elections, not with the party, but with the list of the new electoral committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the capital liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes, decisions of the board.
By October 31, the Vilnius chapter had to cancel the aspirations to participate in municipal elections with a list of the committee.
But the department did not do that.
The former head of the parliamentary section, Au<0xC5><0xA1>rin<0xC4><0x97> Armonait<0xC4><0x97>, has already left the Liberal movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, former President of the Liberal Movement Remigijus <0xC5><0xA0>ima<0xC5><0xA1>ius, promising to seek another term of office of the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "To Vilnius, we are proud!".
He also left the party.
Municipal councils and mayors' elections will be held in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India used a tractor to transport a tiger that had previously killed one man, officials said on Monday.
Forestry officer Mahavir Kaujlagi said the tiger ripped off a man who worked in the fields late on Sunday, the villagers surrounded the animal and, while trying to escape, drove it on a tractor.
Residents say that this tiger also attacked and spat on one young man about 10 days ago.
The mentioned village is located in the Dudhva Tigers territory of Lakhimpur Kheri district, about 250 km southeast of the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh, Laknau.
Prohibition of tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
Ramesha Pandey, director of insurance, said the case would be reported to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, villagers in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh struck another tiger, who suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is the national animal of India; under the Wildlife Protection Act, the tiger is considered a species of extinction.
Last year's government data showed that at least one person was killed every day during the previous three years in clashes with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with tigers have been on the rise since the 1980s, when India launched a tigers protection program that established bans on national parks and criminalized the killing of large cats.
Although the methods for counting tigers have changed, the censuses show that the population of about 1,800 tigers at that time increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Proposed mandatory marking of cats and dogs with microchips
The Chairman of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee, K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, together with other Seimas members, registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which proposes mandatory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs be required to be labelled with subsoil microchips and that their registration and labelling be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be labeled free of charge with state funds, and in 2020, cats will also be labeled free of charge, so the public will not be worried and the costs will be covered by the state funding specifically provided for," said K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Chairman of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for the labelling of pets.
It is expected that this will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that the expected average cost of the micro-chip and service, which will reach around EUR 5, will be reimbursed to all animal owners during the transitional period.
The total cost of all pet labelling can reach up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million.
It is planned that the need for this funding will be distributed over three years and will reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million per year.
It is expected that the funds for labelling programmes will be allocated through the Municipal Environmental Support Special Programme, which will significantly increase revenues this year as a result of increased taxes on natural resources and redistribution of funds.
These funds will be used by municipalities not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to Mr. Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikos, the practice of mandatory labelling has been widespread in almost all countries of the European Union, it allows the protection of the animals themselves (because the lost can be easily returned to the owners), and saves the time of the animal farmers themselves, when the runaway and the lost pet is kept for a long time.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only allowed with pets marked.
At the same time, labelling obliges to take care of the animal responsibly throughout its life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling were met with resistance, as the relevant programmes were proposed to be financed by the population.
"The model now provided should avoid this criticism, because it is proposed to finance animal protection with increased revenues in an environmental support program and to give the right to label not only veterinarians, but also publicists, i.e. persons of animal care institutions who have listened to special courses in the veterinary academy."
The bill was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different Seimas groups - K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
Thirteen government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
Arif Noori, the provincial governor's spokesman, said seven soldiers and six police officers had been killed.
He added that four more soldiers were wounded during the attack on the joint army and police control post in Chongqing district.
According to Noori, six fighters were killed in a three-hour battle with Afghan forces and another 10 were wounded.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement in which the movement claimed responsibility for Monday's attack in Ghazni province.
Noori said the post was set up two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban's supply route.
During the attack, the post was completely destroyed.
"Morning" extends a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will be held in Vilnius's "Ryto" arena, where Kosovo and Ukrainian clubs will meet.
The duel will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius "Rytas", which maintains a warm relationship with Ukrainian basketball, will host Cherkaski Mavpy and Pristina's KB Prishtina teams under its roof in the "Ryto" arena on November 7th.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we could not hold this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to welcome us," coach Maxim Michelson thanked the Ukrainian team's senior coach.
“We have a lot of friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best countries in the world with basketball traditions, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope to get some support from the Lithuanians.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine because these countries have no diplomatic relations.
Currently, after the first round, the Ukrainian team takes third place with one victory in three meetings, and the Kosovo team is in second position and has more victory.
This will be a very important challenge for Group E, as only two teams will make it to the next stage.
In the past, there was also a selection of Ukrainian and Kosovo national teams for the 2017 European Basketball Championship in Vilnius.
Then 100:61 won the Ukrainian team.
Basketball enthusiasts will be able to enter the match on Wednesday for free, and the match starts at 19:00.
"Women Lie Better" star B. Arsobaita is being persecuted by liars
This is probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown actress Brigita Arsobait<0xC4><0x97> has already been given roles related to liars.
Initially, the series "Women Lie Better", then the show "Liars" and finally the comedy "Liars".
In this film, Brigita plays the playful wife of Dainius Kazlausks hero.
"I really enjoyed filming Lies because I'm more of a theater actress and I rarely appear in movies.
The wonderful team of colleagues gathered from the very beginning promised an excellent result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened in the playground was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would really be big and serious.
I've never been fascinated by those small, decorative "fiff" four-pieces.
But during the filming, Sunny was so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and eventually I even overtook her to buy it from the hostess, but it was unsuccessful.
From the first minutes onwards, a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai" was shot into the comic and intriguing peripetias of family members, produced by the Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Among Us, Boys..." by Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasios Baltakis and Razarios Vladimiris.
Your loved one just announced - she's waiting.
That would be great news, but... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that’s not all.
After announcing the "good news" to everyone, parents unexpectedly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this takes place just before the most beautiful holiday of the year - St. Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, because no one expected such an atomization.
All heroes are not what they looked like at first sight...
In addition to B. Arsobait<0xC4><0x97>'s comedy "Melagiai", four film stars present a good mood to the audience: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita U<0xC5><0xBE>ait<0xC4><0x97>, Giedr<0xC4><0x97> Giedraityt<0xC4><0x97>, Lubomiras Laucevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Larissa Kalpokait<0xC4><0x97> and Gediminas Gird.
Comedy "Liars" - in the cinemas from November 9th
Deciding whether to write off <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million in unpaid taxes
On Tuesday, the Seimas approved an amendment to the Law on the Declaration of Residence prepared by Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, the leader of the "peasants".
Sixty-six members voted in favour, nine against, and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will continue to consider the amendments on December 6 or later, after the government has reached its conclusions.
According to Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, in three years, one person does not pay about 1 thousand euros, and now there are about 100 thousand such people.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would "try some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Conservative member of the Health Committee Antanas Matulas noted that Lithuanians living abroad benefit from the fact that they come to Lithuania for treatment when paying a small health insurance tax - they are given the same services as those who pay this tax.
The amendments provide that those persons who will pay social security contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation will be considered as departing from Lithuania, and Sodra will exempt them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Sodra's head Mindaugas Sinkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius has previously said that such a step will facilitate both the lives of the emigrated people and the activities of Sodra.
Online video of a wandering bear reveals a serious problem <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
It is drawn as the mother's bow climbs a straight snowy slope, and the baby sticks up, slides down and again persistently copy.
The video received a lot of reviews and comments.
People admired the persistence of the little bear - many times he slipped down, he climbed back to his mother.
He does not succeed at first, but the baby does not even try to give up and finally reaches his goal.
The video was indeed the focus of attention, but it also reveals the threat posed by humans to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to know the wild nature can sometimes be harmful.
"I'm sure the bear was very frightened.
From their movements, we can see that they are panicking.
If the drone had not flown around, they would probably have chosen a safer route or overcome it more slowly or cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Ditmer, along with colleagues, investigated how drones affect bears.
The animals were fitted with heart rate monitors.
As the drone approached, some bears ran away, others did not run anywhere, but all their hearts began to beat more often from fear.
Scientists advise drones to film animals to use responsibly, not to fly too close, not to make noise, and not to fly where it is prohibited.
The runaway president was approached by a newspaper
The Kiev court on Tuesday invited the outgoing overthrown President Viktor Yanukovych to come to the trial for his alleged betrayal of the state in an unusual way - the call was announced in the state's official publication.
In a court summons issued in the government's news newspaper Uriadovoj Kurjer, the former leader is invited to attend a November 19 criminal trial session at which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that V. Yanukovych has the right to participate in the meeting by video link.
On October 30, the Kiev court announced the end of the debate in the case of V. Yanukovych.
Mr. Yanukovych’s lawyer, who works in Russia, was given the opportunity to register with the Register of Foreign Lawyers by November 19, so that he could attend a meeting where Mr. Yanukovych is expected to have his last word on video.
Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, prompted by the president's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former leader of Ukraine was taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Ukrainian-owned peninsula of Crimea, and a little later in the east of the country there was a war between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, the fighting has claimed the lives of some 10,000 people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure long-term ceasefires.
The list of conservatives in the Vilnius City Council will be published by Valdas Benkunskas
The Conservative candidate for the year had already been approved by the former Minister of Economy, the parliamentarian Dainius Kreivys.
On the weekend, during the Conservative primary elections, the party members ranked the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Council.
According to the party, the leader of the list of conservatives was V. Benkunskas, chairman of the Vilnius TS-LKD conference.
Among the top ten candidates were members of the Vilnius City Council Paul<0xC4><0x97> Kuzmickien<0xC4><0x97>, Adamas Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas, Gediminas <0xC5><0xA0>vilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Ba<0xC5><0xA1>kien<0xC4><0x97>, former Seimas member Liutauras Kazlaviksija, Benan<0xC4><0x97>s Kara<0xC5><0xAB>t, and the chairman of the Young Conservatives’ League, Valaskas
The direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on March 3 next year.
Restrictions on Cogeneration Power Plants Complaints to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CT) against the decision of the governors to pass a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition faction of the Seimas of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of Seimas members appealed to the KT, asking to investigate the compliance of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the governors with the Constitution.
"Parliamentarians emphasize that the provisions of the law seek to question the projects of waste incineration plants that are already underway, instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance from the residential area) until the entry into force of the law for the construction of waste in Vilnius and Kaunas -in the pre-incineration power"
"Parliament noted that in view of the fact that the prohibition on the construction of landfills in the country is contained in the law, the prohibition on the construction of landfills is contained in the law, the prohibition on the construction of landfills is contained in the law, the prohibition on the construction of landfills is contained in the law, the prohibition on the construction of landfills is contained in the law (i.e. the definition of "residential territory")), the prohibition on the prohibition on the construction of landfills is contained in the prohibition on landfills is contained in the
It is argued that the adopted law is contrary to the constitutional rule of law.
"The TC has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that have occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted legislation.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law back on the basis of an indefinite criterion.
When such legal regulation is established, the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law, are violated.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration plants.
With the suspension of the projects currently underway, the state would not only suffer hundreds of millions of financial losses, huge losses, and the Lithuanian population would face an increase in heating prices, due to the increasing amount of waste disposal in landfills, which would result in increased environmental pollution.
The petition was signed by Algirdas Butkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Deputy Senior Member of the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic Groups and the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes from the governing bodies to reject the amendments to President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>'s veto of the Waste Management Act, which provided for the government's right to stop the construction of already begun cogeneration plants, and also set a 20-mile-long deadline for the construction of a new cogeneration zone.
The amendments adopted by the Seimas will come into force from 1 January 2019. The truth is that the governors are already proposing to waive the 20 km restriction.
The proposal is expected to be discussed in the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government’s right to stop projects already started is not planned to be waived.
KT will deal with this case in order - no sooner than a year later.
LeBron James’ questioning statistics published at the Lakers Club
LeBron James’s career start at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he himself, the organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start has helped spark rumors about the possible resignation of coach Luke Walton.
Magic Johnson, the president of basketball operations, said he would not forgive the coach, but the game needed to be played better.
The team’s biggest star, L. James, should turn to himself.
Although the attacker's statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 rebounds.
But she doesn’t tell the whole truth.
During the first ten games of the season, other numbers also emerged, showing that the Lakers play better when there is no L. James on the pitch.
The attacker has a negative +/- statistic showing how many more points a team throws or misses when certain players are on the pitch.
That’s when L. James is on the pitch, the Lakers have spent 30 points more this season than their rivals.
As he sat on the ground, the "Ezer<0xC5><0xAB>nas" earned 19 points more than their opponents.
Currently, the Lakers are only 13th in the Western Conference, but a few victories can turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania greatly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and region," said Minister Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out five NATO air policing and air policing reinforcement missions in the Baltic states, including three in Lithuania.
The last time the Spanish "Eurofighter" fighter jets were deployed in <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai in the months of May-August of this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations are taking place between Lithuania and Spain on issues of security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda.
Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius expressed the hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to cooperate closely in addressing the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga has been the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On October 29, Jose Maria Robles Fraga handed the letters of nomination to President Dalias Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> on the arrest of R. A<0xC4><0x8D>o: I believe in the innocence of the man and the law enforcement
“It was the most amazing thing I could ever think of.
On the other hand, the services are probably doing the work they have to do.
We all do our own work.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no dishonest actions of his should be taken," - said V. Achien<0xC4><0x97>.
A<0xC4><0x8D>a was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still the director of the Raseiniai municipality administration, took a high-value bribe and in return could have made exceptional conditions for a private company that has signed a contract with the municipal authorities.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly copying R. A<0xC4><0x8D>a or participating in various financial transactions.
The council of Raseiniai district municipality dismissed R. A<0xC4><0x8D>a in April this year in a third attempt after expressed mistrust from the office of the head of the administration.
Former "manager" in March of this year became a member of the newly established Gediminas Kirkilas-led Lithuanian Social Democrats Labour Party, he suspended his membership in this party on Monday.
A few years ago, he unsuccessfully ran for mayor in the elections as a representative of the election committee "Tavo Raseiniai".
Achien<0xC4><0x97> says the man did not intend to run for mayor of Raseiniai next year, but has not yet decided whether he will participate in municipal council elections.
V. Achien<0xC4><0x97> was elected to the Seimas with the list of Lithuanian peasants and greens, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she is waiting for further law enforcement action - it will depend on whether she will step down from the work commission.
“I really don’t make any honest decisions today, I think I’ll make a decision this week.
I will see, if there is a need, what accusations are made, of course, I will make one or the other decision.
Perhaps I need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - everything will put time in its place," she said.
The representative of the opposition conservatives Seimas Radvil<0xC4><0x97> Mork<0xC5><0xAB>nait<0xC4><0x97>-Mikul<0xC4><0x97>nien<0xC4><0x97> called on the Seimas President Viktor Prankkietis and the "peasant" leader Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis to deviate from the statements of his party colleague Vidas A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97>s and to withdraw her from the committee of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
She argues that further work of V. Achien<0xC4><0x97> in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would lead to society-based distrust and would discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervisory commission."
Sensual "Coldplay" music amused and famous Lithuanian couples
On the autumn evening of Monday, many music and film lovers gathered for the premiere of the film "Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams".
The event was attended by a group of famous people: Jonas and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of one of the most popular British pop bands, Coldplay, which permeates with moments from concerts.
Documentary director Matas Whitecross met the group’s guys back when they were still playing in bars and gathered just a few dozen spectators.
In the film you can see footage from behind the scenes of concerts, rehearsals or leisure.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in college in 1996 and formed the band Pectoralz.
Soon they were joined by bassist Guy Berryman, and a little later by drummer Will Champion.
The band changed their name to Coldplay and just twenty years ago released their first record, Safety, which contained three tracks.
The majority of the 500 copies of the record were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of "Safety" were released.
Now Coldplay is a world-renowned, respected and loved band that has released seven albums with over 100 million copies sold.
Over the past two decades, the group has won 107 awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.
"Juventus" married V. <0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis to victory - LKL week MVP
Vaidas <0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis won the title of the most useful player of the week after Utena's "Juventus" victory in the solid match "Betsafe-LKL".
The center collected a double double, which helped the Juventus team to beat Alytus Dz<0xC5><0xAB>kijas players during the 86:77 extension.
In almost 31 minutes, V.<0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis collected 13 points (5/6 doubles) and recovered 11 balls.
In addition, the high-lift provoked a 7-run gap, took over 3 balls and made 4 successful transfers.
Such indicators guaranteed 30 utility points.
This season, V.<0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis collects 17.2 utility points and this is the best indicator of his career in playing the 11th season of LKL.
High heels are the fourth most useful basketball player of this season.
Together with V. <0xC4><0x8C>epukai<0xC4><0x8D>, Martynas Gecevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius and K<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1>tofas Lavrinovi<0xC4><0x8D>ius (both - Prien<0xC5><0xB3> "Skycop"), Yannickas Franke (Milk Stars of the World) and Jerai Grant (Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da "Nept<0xC5><0xAB>nas").
Only recently, in the 88:93 losing match with Prienai, the legionary Y.Franke added to the Pasvalis team by throwing 24 points, rebounding 10 balls and causing 8 opponents to lose, earning as many as 31 utility points.
True, the most useful basketball player of the week did not allow him to be defeated by the team.
On that day, his opponent - Prienai teams representing M.Gecevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius - made up the defending chain five times with the legionary of the Pasvalis team.
He scored 19 points and rebounded 9 balls.
Such indicators guaranteed the sniper 26 utility scores.
You can also see another Skycop basketball player in the high-stakes chain - K. Lavrinovi<0xC4><0x8D>ius scored 15 points (3/4 doubles, 9/11 penalty) in Sunday's match, caused a 7-match draw and collected 23 utility points.
Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da's "Nept<0xC5><0xAB>nas" striker J. Grant also got into the fifth place in the powerful game in Vilnius.
The American threw 25 points in 25 minutes (10/11 in two), won 4, took 3 balls, and so accumulated even 29 utility points.
Such a legionnaire's appearance allowed the marchers to triumph in the capital against the local "Morning" 78:66.
The highest incidence of flu - in one of the major cities
Influenza and acute upper respiratory tract infections (OCTIs) have declined across the country in the past week.
According to the data of the Center for Communicable Diseases and AIDS (ULAC), the total number of cases of flu in Lithuania and HCVTI was 49.9 in 10 thousand inhabitants from October 29 to November 4.
Last week, this figure reached 68.1 cases of 10,000 people.

Palestinian man stabbed to death in West Bank <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The military "prevented this attack because it identified a terrorist who tried to knife civilians and an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) officer," according to an Israeli army report on the incident at Kiryat Arba near Hebron.
"The guy started a fire on the terrorist and neutralized it.
He was taken to the hospital.
Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers were not harmed," the statement said.
A military spokeswoman told AFP that the attack was attempted by Palestinians.
After the incident, the video footage shows that he was not seriously injured.
A similar wave of attacks by Palestinians began in 2015.
Such attacks have decreased in recent years, but there are fears that a new wave of them may arise.
On October 22, a Palestinian man was shot with a knife at a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron.
Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> urges China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU businesses
President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for European Union (EU) countries to facilitate conditions for foreign imports.
Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> stressed at the opening of the Trade and Investment Forum in Shanghai that, in the face of signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be "to unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world" by applying the "increase in the flow of competition and the tensions caused by major trade wars".
"For the European Union, China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment is very important - it is important to negotiate a trade agreement with China.
It is important to complete this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> said.
According to her, the opening of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The head of Lithuania stressed that the transparency of investments must be "above the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, rule of law, strict observance of international treaties - this must be an essential thing for new investment relations for the environment," - emphasized D. Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China’s import show is trying to alleviate criticism that it avoids opening up its market and only protects its businesses.
The exhibition is attended by several heads of state, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuania’s exports to China increased by 50%, which amounted to 180 million euros.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that China’s investment in Lithuania could bring unwanted political influence, and Beijing’s exclusive focus on Eastern Europe is tearing apart the EU’s unity.

The cause of the Lion Air plane crash has been revealed: relatives of the deceased are angry
Data from the broken liner black box of Indonesian airline Lion Air shows that a malfunction of the speedometer has occurred in at least four of its last flights, the researchers said on Monday.
The chairman of the National Transportation Security Committee (NTSC), Soerjant Tjahjon, said a similar direction had emerged during the last four flights of the plane, including the fatal one on October 29, when the airliner landed in the Java Sea just after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed in the crash.
Many media outlets have reported incidents during the previous flight of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the technical problem was actually the speed of the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," he said at a press conference.
"Black box data showed that during the two flights before the flight Denpasar-Jakarta, there was also the same problem," he added.
“There are a lot of rumors on social media.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (the data remains) about four flights, during which there were problems with the air speed meter," - said the head of the NTSK.
During a meeting with family members of the deceased, Mr. Tjahjon said the information from the device recording the flight data was consistent with reports that the speed and altitude of the last flight of the plane had changed unevenly.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box that records conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air said that during the flight from Bali to Jakarta, it was repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak at a meeting with family members of communications minister Budi Karyas Sumadi, who moderated the meeting with officials overseeing the search and investigation of the plane's remains and victims.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Kirana, along with his brother Kusnan, be introduced to Lion Air in 1999.
"Lion Air has been misbehaving," said one man, who portrayed himself as the father of a passenger named Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island the plane was flying to.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
“Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn’t show us any sympathy.”
After the meeting, Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of identification of the dead.
Nearly 140 body bags, loaded parts of human support, have been handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives raised the question of why the airliner, which was launched two months ago, was allowed to fly, despite a malfunction during the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, among other things, causing the passengers to be frightened by a sudden downfall of the plane immediately after takeoff.
Lion Air has said that this failure has been eliminated.
Is it true that the problem was solved? asked one of the dead son.
- If not, the relevant technicians must be brought to account.
The law is very clear, they did not claim that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond according to the law so that plane crashes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Jahjon said the large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris spread over a rather small area indicate that the liner was likely hitting the water at very high speeds.
"The plane was unified when it landed at sea.
"He didn't blow up, and the aircraft's engines, when he touched the water, were operating in large laps - this is evidence of all the broken turbine blades," the official said.
The collapse of the Lion Air liner is the largest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people were killed in a plane crash near Medan.
After the accident, rescuers led from the wreckage: injured and a minor
On Monday evening on the road V<0xC4><0x97><0xC5><0xBE>ai<0xC4><0x8D>iai - Plung<0xC4><0x97>, cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz collided at Tilvikai.
Cars collided with a car crash and three people were reported injured.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, was driving on the opposite side of the road, and the cockatoo ran into the car "Mercedes-Benz", which took place by a father, born in 1967, and a daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters - rescuers.
A girl from Mercedes-Benz got her teeth knocked out in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
The Presidency: no artificial easing of the referendum is needed
After the Seimas approves the proposal of the governors to reduce the referendum cartel to the first section of the Constitution that currently has greater protection, the president will veto the amendments, says her adviser Mindaugas Ling<0xC4><0x97>.
"More than half the population voted for the Constitution - this is a requirement.
This and its amendment, especially the articles in its first section, should certainly be by no less than a majority .
It is not difficult to predict that the president will really veto," Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>, an adviser to domestic policymakers, told News Radio on Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic matters of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, therefore, reducing the number of votes necessary to change these articles, according to Ms. Ling<0xC4><0x97>, would create a "negative precedent" and "a negative precedent"
"In the President's view, there is no need for any artificial facilitation, there is more need to prepare for the referendum itself, there is a need for more dialogue with the people," he said.
The Seimas plans to vote on Tuesday on an amendment to the Referendum Bill.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution with higher protection shall be adopted if at least two-fifths of the citizens entitled to vote so agree in a referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote can replace the articles of the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution with a referendum.
In Lithuania, about 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote: half of them would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths - one million voters.
The proposal came after the Seimas approved a presidential veto in September over amendments passed earlier in parliament that eased the requirement for the number of votes to change nationality, defining Article 12 of Section 1 of the Constitution.
The cartel is proposed to be reduced in preparation for a referendum on dual citizenship, which is scheduled to take place on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential election are planned.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990 cannot currently, with some exceptions, hold dual citizenship.
The global Lithuanian community seeks dual citizenship, but fears that under the current conditions, a referendum will not take place - a sufficient number of people will not vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "bra<0xC5><0xA1>ka", so they need to be updated
Lithuania’s airport and road infrastructure are starting to erode, so it needs to be upgraded, says Transport Minister Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius airport is the minimum task that the state must perform.
“Air transport infrastructure is already fragile because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We have to renovate Vilnius airport - this is not even part of the long-distance planning, it is the minimum that we must do," Mr Masiulis said at a communication conference held by the Democracy Development Fund and the State magazine on Tuesday.
According to the minister, the next decade will be extremely important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of Klaipeda's outer port, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and perhaps the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the construction of roads, railway integration, the construction of an external airport in Klaipeda, to arrange the airports, perhaps to decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, we must already start projects that will use our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years," the Minister of Transport said.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that there has been too little funding for road maintenance in recent years.
"The road situation is not improving so far, because the funds are not being allocated enough.
We are predicting the construction of new roads, but even the most essential for maintenance, for example on highways, funds are lacking.
We have to determine the amount that should be allocated to road maintenance if we want their condition to improve," Masiulis said.
He stressed that Lithuania’s exports of transport services grew by 18.6% this year, and the largest export market was Germany, which overran Russia.
Mr Massiulis has once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers must periodically return tractors to the country of registration.
“We need to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, it is absurd to suggest that tractors return home on a regular basis, because empty trucks would be driven in Europe, fuel would be burned, emissions would be increased.
Most of all, the railways will benefit from this, because the cost will increase so much that part of the transport will be transferred to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
Lithuanian Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 people and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Disputes with Heritage Protectors
Last week, Mr. Masiulis announced the start of negotiations in the Seimas Economic Committee on the change of the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building - this would allow to demolish the old terminal and build a new one.
However, Algimantas Degutis, interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage, called Mr. Masiulis’s deliberations political pressure.
According to him, a building built in the sixties of the last century is a value, it was registered in 1993, and not by politicians, and specialists have to decide on its deletion.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"The withdrawal of that old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step in order to be able to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal, so that the arrivals in Vilnius feel in a modern country, rather than in such an interesting, really unrepresentative of our country as an innovative one," she said last week.
Mr. Masiulis then also reported that Kaunas is planning to build a completely new passenger terminal and the airport to connect with Rail Baltica by building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to operate in 2026, after the completion of the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected 4.8 million passengers, and next year - 5 million.
Kaunas Airport last year served a total of 1.2 million passengers.
What are the Lithuanian soldiers doing in Afghanistan?
The NCBs shall provide the tasks they carry out.
In total, almost 50 Lithuanian soldiers are serving in Afghanistan.
Kabul.
The headquarters of Kabul International Airport in the Afghan capital is served by troops of the logistics sector, serving all Lithuanians deployed in the country, organizing visits and military rotations.
This headquarters is also served by two Lithuanian Special Operations Forces soldiers, who ensure the interaction of the NATO mission leadership and combat support with the “species” in Kandahar.
At the headquarters of the NATO mission "Strong Support" are military police officers who oversee public order.
Officers of the Lithuanian headquarters serve in the same headquarters.
They are responsible for reconnaissance, operations, planning and logistics.
Kandaharas.
About 30 Lithuanian Special Operations Forces are serving in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
They trained the local police special operations unit, which serves about 150 Afghans.
Officers of the SOP are trained at their own training sites or outside of them.
"Aitvaram" is also joined by an Air Force soldier, who manages unmanned aircraft.

The headquarters in this city in the northwestern part of Afghanistan are staffed by staff officers.
They work on boards responsible for military training, logistics, reconnaissance, operations and planning.
Next year, direct flights to Madagascar will start from Vilnius
In the spring of next year, the largest passenger aircraft, Boeing 767, will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of B<0xC4><0x97>, belonging to Madagascar, according to the travel portal "Itaka in Lithuania".
It is announced that Blue Panorama airline passengers will be able to choose from 259 Economy Class and 8 Business Class seats.
The new holiday direction will be reached directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, CEO of Itaka Lithuania, says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new directions for holidays.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
New holiday travel directions for the summer season 2019 were also prepared by other tour operators.
For example, "Novaturas" and "Itaka" will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on the possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
“We always have to prepare for difficult times.
What I want to be happy about is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in Lithuania’s history, we are accumulating reserves.
But it is also a very important thing not to talk about the disease," Shapok said while visiting Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Finance Minister and Vice-Minister Migl<0xC4><0x97> Tuskien<0xC4><0x97> will attend the meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how to tax revenues generated from the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States until there is a global consensus.
The Eurogroup will review draft budgets submitted to the European Commission (EC) for the euro area countries.
On 23 October, the European Commission rejected Italy's draft budget as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the Commission has taken advantage of this opportunity.
For more information, please contact Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss deepening the Economic and Monetary Union: the possibilities for the implementation of the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.

Lithuanian work traditions and customs
Recently, it was 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural yearbooker, ethnographer and country explorer Balis Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as (1897-1972) in Sidari, <0xC5><0xA0>iauli<0xC5><0xB3> valscie, in the then <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai Governorate.
In commemorating the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-sustaining national revival has called many Lithuanian people, including the brothers Bura<0xC4><0x8D>us - Bali, Jonas, Bronios - from the very depths of the countryside to the power of all creatives to engage in our culture and tradition.
Balis Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as, who has travelled through his native country for more than 50 years with a camera in his hands, presented a wide and realistic picture of the customs, traditions, folk art and material culture of our country.
He sought to preserve the rapidly deteriorating layers of national culture and had a rare ability to grasp the lasting value of his work.
In the photographs of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>a, Lithuanian landscape, castle mountains, everyday life and festive environment, our people decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication presents a large part of the Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D> legacy, dedicated to the description of national working customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the uniqueness and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and a difficult occupation.
In the manuscript of the book there are very many descriptions of the interwar <0xC5><0xBD>emaitija, especially of the Kupi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x97>nai, <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai, Tel<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1>kiai, as well as of the works of the inhabitants of Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitija and Dz<0xC5><0xAB>kija, their festivals and other traditions and customs written by Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as.
Of the approximately 10,000 negatives that remain in museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photos have been selected, grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture characteristic of cupi<0xC5><0xA1>kas, d<0xC5><0xBE>uks, other districts of Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitija and <0xC5><0xBD>emaitija.
In Panev<0xC4><0x97><0xC5><0xBE>ys, a suspect who escaped from a police car was freed for 4 hours

The tragic fate of the couple: died in just a few hours of marriage
In the southwestern U.S. state of Texas, a helicopter crash killed a newlywed couple just hours earlier.
24-year-old William Troy Byler and his wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler were killed on Sunday shortly after midnight by a helicopter crashing into a hill 16 km north-west of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, the local lawmaker said.
Strangely enough, the accident occurred after a flight of about 24 kilometers, just as many newlyweds were years old.
Helicopter pilot Gerald Douglas Lawrence, 76, has also died.
They studied at Sam Houston State University, located in the Texas state of Hantsville.
They were married on Saturday evening at the Byleri family ranch near Juvaldi and after the wedding party, a helicopter belonging to the family flew out.
The accident occurred after the helicopter flew for about 24 kilometers.
Youngsters flew to Sant Antoni International Airport, where they were going to get on the plane and fly for the honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the final destination for the couple's trip.
“This is a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high,” Kennedy said.
Mr. D. Lawrence had been piloting the family's aircraft for many years.
According to Kennedy, he flew helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be clear what the physical condition of the pilot was and whether it could not have been the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after takeoff.
Its wreckage was seen in broad beams on the rocky slope of the hill, and the body remained "dangerously hanged," Flight Safety Investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said during a press conference on Monday.
Investigators are going to remove the debris and then inspect it thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the tractor and truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been established and the preliminary NTSB report should be published in two weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister Calls New Sanctions on Iran ‘Historical Day’
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told members of his Likud party's parliament, his office said.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the United States imposes particularly stringent sanctions on Iran, the most stringent sanctions on Iran during all the time that efforts have begun to curb its aggression," he said.
Israel's Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Monday that the new sanctions would be a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the most stringent sanctions of all time," came after Trump's controversial decision to withdraw from the world power deal with Tehran over its nuclear program in May.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by about one million barrels per day since May, and cutting Tehran off from international funding.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran and says its scope and terms are too limited.
The Jewish state also said the lifting of the sanctions allowed Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has promised not to allow it to establish itself there militarily.
Other parties to the Iran deal - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - disagree with the US decision and say the deal, as planned, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court again examined the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
With the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, in the northern city, the court will hear the testimony of the witness in the case.
The Vilnius District Court decided on Tuesday that in order to find out all the relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses will be questioned at the next meeting on 26 November.
An acquittal has already been issued in this case, but the prosecution does not agree with it.
On August 22, a Vilnius district court in connection with a motorcycle accident that resulted in the death of a motorcyclist exonerated the driver of the car, after the 79-year-old Eduard Osipov announced that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed in the city and caused a serious injury.
Vilnius District Prosecutor’s Office asks the District Court to overturn the District Court’s judgment and claims that Osipov is the biggest culprit in the accident, while the District Court’s findings are unfounded.
The acquittal is also requested by the family lawyer of the deceased motorcyclist.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015, at about 3 p.m., when Osipov’s <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia, a car driven from Lak<0xC5><0xAB>nai Street, entered <0xC5><0xBD>irm<0xC5><0xAB>nai Street and collided with a motorbike on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man of violating the road traffic rules foreseen to give way, and caused a traffic accident - the death of a man driving a main road motorcycle "Piaggo".
Initial police reports indicated that a scooter driver had died, but later, after investigations, it was found that the vehicle was similar in power to a motorcycle.
Vilnius District Court Judge Rolandas Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas told BNS that experts found that the driver of the motorcycle was driving at 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the speed allowed at that place was 50 kilometers per hour.
"The driver of the car could not have predicted that the motorcycle would be driven at such a high speed," the judge said.
At the time, the driver of an honorable age claimed to have driven at a speed of only 5-6 kilometers per hour.
When the driver saw the obstacle, he tried to stop and fell from the vehicle before colliding with the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia.
The prosecutor’s office believes that Osipov had to give way to the motorcyclist after driving from the side to the main road.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Wagner mercenaries killed in Syria
Among the dead were five Syrian soldiers and six people belonging to the military company Wagner.
This was reported by the Novaya Gazeta in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Armed Forces Corps is located in the said territory, to which a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries" have also joined.
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry to provide information on the fate of the Russians.
Ex-Belgian King Will Have to Take a Paternity Test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as a child of a former monarch since 2013.
The 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II had a brief love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies paternity.
According to the RTBF station, it can appeal to the Supreme Court in opposition to DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel - the ex-husband of a Delphinian mother - is neither biologically nor legally the father of the artist.
Delphine appealed for the appropriate investigation in order to be recognized as the "true" daughter of her father, Albert.
We will allocate money to the parties, but we will not give anything to the social workers
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) is planning to allocate a budget grant of almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million to major political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), which was established this spring under the leadership of Deputy Speaker of the Parliament Gediminas Kirkil, is not yet scheduled to allocate funds from the budget.
However, they may be allocated in the near future by a separate decision of the JRC if the legal environment governing the distribution of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>aityte, the President of the CoR, informed the CoR that "a meeting of the Commission is scheduled for Thursday, where it is planned to take a decision on the allocation of a budget grant to the parties."
According to her, a decision on this issue has to be taken by the CoR by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are expected to be allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.751 million.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive a total of 0.2 million euros from the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition in the opposition.
Under the current law, which will be governed by the CoR, when distributing budget money, grants are granted to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections of the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP, established only in the spring of this year, to expect to receive money from the budget.
So far, the party has not participated in any election.
True, the governing coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros at the approaching next year's even three elections - self-government, the president and the European Parliament.
President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> vetoed the relevant amendments to the political parties and budget laws adopted by the Seimas this year.
The Seimas has not yet decided on the veto, but representatives of the ruling party, Kirkilas, and Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, the leader of the Greens, believe that parliamentarians will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, this will not be possible until the meeting of the CoR on Thursday, so, according to Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>ait<0xC4><0x97>, "grants will be distributed according to the existing legal order".
True, the head of the CRC did not rule out that if the Seimas rejected the President’s veto this week or next week and a new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to parties came into force, the commission could consider a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"We will take into account the entire legal environment when making the decision, because we are the executive authority to implement the laws adopted," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and the new laws came into force, the government would allocate additional money to the parties, having additionally borrowed the corresponding amounts.
Grants already allocated to seven parties for such a decision would not be affected.

Poroshenko: Activist Handziuk’s murderers must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and today there are more than 20 - will be rejected.
Each will be thoroughly inspected in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As president, I do not have the opportunity or the obligation to receive information that could be detrimental to the progress of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to know the truth and punish evil," Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he is most interested in the murder of Handziuk being clarified and that the killers, crime organizers and patrons "take the necessary responsibility."
"After this case has been reclassified as a murder, they are rightly and reasonably under threat of imprisonment to the death," he said.
He rightly called the public's demand to investigate the case openly and impartially.
Poroshenko stressed that statements by law enforcement officials in parliament should show that "the government is determined to hold criminals and murderers accountable, whatever they may be."
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not help to clarify the situation, and even more so, to confuse it.
"I call on all the forces supporting the government and the opposition not to squander unfounded arguments and, God forbid, not to use this killing for public relations," he said.
On the contrary, we must now unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, prompt - such as to build public confidence.
There is simply no other way.”
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the situation in the country," he said.
In July, anti-corruption activist K. Handziuk was attacked and splattered with acid in the city of Cherson.
She was the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but died in the hospital on Sunday.
Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuriy Lucenka on Tuesday issued a statement of resignation after the attack's culprits failed to explain to police and prosecutors.
After her death, officials have received accusations from public activists that they are not able to carry out the investigation properly.
The activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister of the Interior.
"Today I am submitting my resignation statement," Lucenka told MEPs, reading her investigative report.
Parliament has yet to approve the prosecutor's resignation.
Lucenka accused the activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of Handziuk’s murder.
Bill Gates unveils toilet without water
Introducing a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such devices to a waterless one with the computer revolution of the 1980s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates unveiled a high-tech toilet that doesn't need water in water pipes at a Beijing exhibition, Reuters reported.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of wastewater are processed into chemical fertilisers.
“The technologies you see here are the biggest achievements in sanitation in the last 200 years,” Gates told Bloomberg.
The technological toilet was created with the help of a charitable foundation founded by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Within seven years, work was underway on a facility that could turn human waste into fertilizer or water, for which the fund spent $200 million.
In total, in the words of Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models were created.
The device is now complete and can be sold.
But in order for such toilets to be mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die each year due to poor sanitation conditions in the world.
Fights against poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, are increasing health spending to $233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates in the toilet presentation of a glass with feces.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example, "there may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100,000 worm parasite eggs."

It was attended by 13 members out of 15.
The main issue on the agenda was the election of a new president.
Two candidates participated in the elections - Sergey Slyva and Vaidotas Rastenis.

Worry in France: Worry about the deaths of people
PARIS (Reuters) - French health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on widely used pesticides, following concerns over dozens of people recently poisoned in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all products with pesticide methamphetamine was taken after a new safety check that began earlier this year, even before at least three waves of poisoning began in the Department of Arts and Sciences in September.
As a result of these cases, the government has already stopped the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfectant should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it was used annually for about 700 tons.
At least 70 people, including a large number of farm workers, in the Anjou region, where many salad broths are grown, complained of cold eyes and throat, breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the justice of our decision, but they did not rush it," Francoise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told the newspaper "Ouest France" on Monday.
Metam, one of the most widely used pesticides in the U.S. and Europe, is considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be a "probable human carcinogen."
This pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check must be carried out.
"There was no choice but to remove him from the market, regardless of whether he had alternatives," Weber told the paper.
"We understand what difficulties will arise for salad broth growers, farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to halt the use of methamphetamine in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
More than half of the 35,000 tonnes of salad broth consumed annually in Europe is grown in this region near Nantes.
The next season will be "a lot less salad broths, radishes and pairs," after the government suspended the use of methamphetamine last month, Philippe Retiere, head of the federation of Nantes growers, told AFP.
In the shopping center with an overview wheel, Taline invested 70 million Eur
Next weekend, a new shopping centre "T1" will be opened in the Estonian capital, in which the local capital real estate (NT) development company "Pro Kapital Grupp" invested EUR 70 million.
A total of 130,000 sq. m, or 55,000 sq. m rented, area in the shopping mall will operate 150 shops or entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, the developer said in a statement.
In comparison, the total area of Vilnius "Acropolis" (computing together with the area for offices) amounts to about 110,000 sq. m.
T1 is the first shopping mall with a rooftop review wheel, the developer says.
It will start operating at the beginning of next year.
In addition to this, international transport gates will also be integrated into the territory: trams are next to it, intercity buses will soon run.
The main terminal of Rail Baltica is also nearby and is projected to serve around 1 million passengers per year in 2026.
Paola Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that the global shopping mall business is undergoing significant changes, while developing T1 has managed to be at the forefront of them.
“We have created a new generation of shopping malls that provide emotions and experiences that are unavailable online.
It is a place of attraction for people in the very center of the city, a gateway for travelers, an impressive and worth a visit and at the same time a quality time with friends or family," Michelozzi said in a statement.
A lot of attention to entertainment
According to the manager of the shopping center, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery center in the Baltics.
A total of 12,000 sq. m., or one fifth of the total rented area, is dedicated to entertainment.
Exceptional accent - on the roof there is an overview wheel.
It will lift guests to 120 m above sea level - Tallinn's taller only TV tower.
After the review round, on the fourth floor, the Super Skypark will operate, opening Europe’s largest shoe centre and Estonia’s first shoe basket and netting pitch, the company says.
In the interactive SkyLAB research and discovery center, children are promised to work at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will also feature a 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to experience the virtual reality cinema with an interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to visual effects and moving chairs according to the rhythm of the film, the sense of reality here will be enhanced by the effects of the perceived wind, rain or snow, as well as selected smells, smoke or fog in the cinema.
According to the developer, the opening of the "T1" is expected to increase Estonia's revenue from tourism by 13 million euros per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Stock Exchange as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group in Lithuania received 1.8 million euros in sales revenue and suffered a loss of 350,000 euros, according to the financial report of Pro Kapital Grupp.
In 2016, almost EUR 9 million of sales revenues were generated on the Lithuanian market and net profit of EUR 2.4 million was earned.
The T1 shopping center was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
President Paul Biya sworn in for seventh term in Cameroon after controversial elections
During a ceremony overseen by Parliament Speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, 85-year-old Biya pledged to protect the "unity and unity" of the West African state.
Africa’s oldest president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner in the October 7 election, which garnered 71 percent of the vote.
However, the election was overshadowed by low voter activity, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biya’s inauguration, 79 pupils and three school staff, including the principal, were kidnapped at a presbyterian school in the northwestern region, where English-speaking separatists are carrying out an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million inhabitants are French-speaking and one-fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016 in the northwestern and neighboring southwestern provinces, when dissatisfaction with alleged discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy began to demand autonomy.
In 2017, when Biya refused to resign, the radicals declared an independent state, the "Republic of the Embassy", and raised their arms.
According to non-governmental organizations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security officials were killed this year in separatist attacks and government retaliatory operations.
More than 300,000 people have fled violence: some across the border to Nigeria, but many have been forced to live in semi-arid forests.
Only 5% of voters voted in the northwestern region during the elections held in October, and 15% of the electorate in the southwestern province.
Mr Biya won two-thirds of the vote in both parts of the country.
Conservative primary elections: mistakes were caused by inexperience
"Some things were missing in places - understand that the party organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities have allowed their premises to be used, but there were no voting booths everywhere, because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who have borrowed,” the politician said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not change substantially, and the violations themselves are not of a malicious nature.
“There were complaints.
Not all the people who participated in the elections were experienced - it was news for them too.
As a result of this inexperience, not all of our actions were in line with our order.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CRC to comply with the principles described by us.
These complaints still do not constitute a reason to doubt the results," Anusauskas said.
According to the President of the CRC, there have been cases where ballot papers have not been stamped - after learning about it, ballot papers without a stamp were found in the ballot boxes were canceled.
Some towns lacked space, but, according to Anushausko, complaints and violations relate to several dozen bulletins.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it certainly does not make a substantial difference for the election results," Anusauskas explained.
It is said that the activity of party members in the elections reached 55%, while the activity of non-partisan voters reached 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked in commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also do not change - for the winner Ingrida <0xC5><0xA0>imonyta voted 79% of the voters (16418 votes), while for Vygaud U<0xC5><0xA1>acka - 21% (4441 votes).
On November 17, the TS-LKD Council will officially support the candidacy of I. <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97> in the country's presidential elections in May next year.
Trump Says He's Probably Not Going to Meet Putin in Paris
White House National Security Adviser John Bolton has said Trump will meet with Putin in Paris this week to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.
But in his final rallies ahead of the midterms of the US Congress, Trump told reporters he was not sure if this would be the right time to meet with the Russian president.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
“Probably not,” the US president said.
However, the White House chief added, the two will meet at the G20 summit and "probably meet many times" afterwards.
Trump is still trying to "recharge" relations with Moscow, despite suspicions that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Stroupas asks to cancel the decision of VTEK
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas, former Director General of Santara Clinics at the University of Vilnius, has asked to cancel the decision of the Central Service Ethics Commission (SEC) - he has acknowledged that transactions were not declared in time and thus violated the law.
Mr. Strupo’s complaint was examined by the Vilnius District Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on 26 November.
The applicant requests the annulment of the decision of VTEK on 23 May, BNS spokeswoman Sigita Jacinevi<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> Baltaduon<0xC4><0x97> informed.
K. Strupas believes that gifts given to loved ones should not be declared, he claims that he has understood the exception to the law.
VTEK announced in May that the then removed Director General of Santara Clinics K. Strupas and Silvija Strupien<0xC4><0x97>, Head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation of the University Hospital of the Republic of Vilnius, violated the provisions of the law regulating the declaration of private interests.
The study found that four transactions were declared in non-compliance with the deadlines: a loan taken from the bank in 2010 with the spouse, the acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift given to the daughter in 2017 - an apartment and a loan granted and not repaid in 1996 together with the married individual.
S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97> also declared these transactions by missing deadlines.
Persons who have violated the law on the harmonization of public and private interests in the public service cannot be promoted for a year.
The law obliges to declare not only their own, but also the spouse’s data.
The survey was carried out by VTEK on the basis of the information provided by Info TV.
It is explained whether K. Strupas and his wife S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97>, head of the Department of Outpatient Rehabilitation at the University Hospital of the Republic of Vilnius, declared their transactions in a timely manner.
As announced by Info TV last year, K. Strupas gave his daughter real estate worth 125,000 euros.
However, the former head of Santara’s clinics and his wife did not mention these data in their declarations of interest.
Lawyer K. Stroupi, along with at least a dozen other people, has expressed suspicions in the corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, for winning public purchases of computers, software in clinics from companies demanded an illegal financial reward, it was disguised as support.
In this way, Mr. Stroup is suspected at least five times, in the Santara clinics for public procurement in the field of information technology.
K. Tomps himself denies his guilt.
Corruption suspect Professor K. Strupas was sacked as head of Santara clinics in September.
With the decision of the Department of Health and Vilnius University of Santara clinics, the employment relationship with K. Strupas was terminated at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10, 2013.
Professor Juozas Raistenskis will continue to lead Santara clinics on a temporary basis until the competition for the election of the new Director-General is held, which is promised to be announced later this year.

Schools already want to teach differently: promises fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday at the forum "Change in the content of education: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania".
Speaking in the debate, Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97> said that over the last ten years, more than 30 million euros have been invested in the renewal of educational content, but no results have been seen.
"According to the results of the international student achievement study PISA, the student achievement is below the OECD average," said Education and Science Minister Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>.
The OECD expert Phil Lambert (Phil Lambert), quoted in the report by the Ministry of Education and Science, said that Lithuania is too focused on the provision of knowledge and not on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in Lithuania, general education programs pay a lot of attention to the literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility of students, but it is also necessary for the creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy of children.
When presenting the changes in the content of general education, Deputy Minister of Education and Science Gra<0xC5><0xBE>vydas Kazakevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said that the volume of programs starting to be updated in this academic year will decrease, they will be more specific and the disciplines will be more closely linked to each other.
According to the Deputy Minister, the education of pupils will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30% of their unique educational content, the current pupil assessment system will change into a cumulative score, gain more weight and acquired in an informal way.
Smaller standardized tests.
It is expected that the general education programmes will be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, a task bank.
The aim of updating the educational content is to improve the achievement of pupils in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to reduce the gap between pupils’ achievements, pupils’ acquisition of modern competences in school by a third, and to be literate in various areas.
Lithuania plans to allocate an amount of 7.8 million euros from the European Union and the state budget from May 2018 to update the educational content.
It is expected that the project of the general education programmes updated in the academic year 2019-2020 will be tested in part of schools, and from September 2021 they will start to be implemented in all schools.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism of the almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 million project of the Centre for Development of Education, aimed at updating the basic, basic and secondary general education programmes.
With <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.8 million planned for four years, the first <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3 million purchase was announced at the beginning of October, looking for developers of educational programmes.
After criticizing this purchase, he was suspended, and Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97> fired Giedri<0xC5><0xB3> Vaidelis, Director of the Centre for Development of Education.
In Lithuania - exercises on how to respond to extreme flooding
In Lithuania, on Monday, ten-day exercises will begin aimed at improving the institutions’ response to extreme flooding.
As reported by the Department of Fire Protection and Rescue (PAGD), the exercise will examine how the state institutions are prepared to work in the country after the announcement of a state-level emergency, such as flooding: to eliminate its consequences, coordinate the search for people, rescue and emergency relief of the inhabitants of the surrounding areas, by circumventing the energy of the
The exercises will be attended by more than 100 representatives from all the country’s ministries, other institutions, as well as members of the emergency operations centers of 12 municipalities.
On November 5-13, the preparatory phase of the exercises will take place, during which the municipalities, having received information from the Hydrometeorological Service about the continuous precipitation and the beginning of flooding, will make decisions on the management of the emergency situation.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for November 14-15.
During this period, the State Emergency Operations Centre will operate in the department, and in the state and municipal institutions - the institutions' emergency operations centres.
After the government announces the state-level emergency due to the effects of the flood, the Prime Minister's appointed operations manager will lead the elimination of the emergency, its consequences, the protection and rescue of the population and assets.
Deputy Director of PAGD Mindaugas Kanapickas says that in the exercises, the most important thing is to check the readiness of the institutions to perform the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the opportunities for the exchange of information, to check how the people, state and municipal institutions and institutions are prepared to warn and inform the public about the impending disaster.
The exercises will also demonstrate the joint capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters and rescuers to pump large amounts of water from the covered areas.
For this purpose, the module "BaltFloodCombat" was established in 2009.
Ukrainian Attorney General Yuriy Luzenka resigns
Ukraine’s Attorney General Yuriy Lucenka on Tuesday announced his resignation due to the resonance caused by the death of an acid-ridden anti-corruption activist Katerina Gandziuk, Ukrainian news agency Unian.net reported.
Under Ukrainian law, a request for resignation must be submitted by the Prosecutor General to the President of the country, who must submit it to the Supreme Council for approval by a majority of the votes.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General Lucenko presented the progress and results of the law enforcement investigation into Gandziuk’s murder order in the Supreme Council.
In a speech to parliamentarians, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that Gandziuk's death was being exploited for public relations by politicians.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her native southern Ukrainian city of Cherson.
On July 31, an unknown assailant, K. Gandziuk, shoved acid into her face.
On 4 November, she died in the hospital due to injuries sustained.
Protesters at Ukraine's Interior Ministry are demanding an answer, which killed Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix news agency reported.
According to Lutsenko, the law enforcement investigation involved 12 people who may have been involved in Gandziuk’s order to kill him.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was leaked to the media, which poses a threat to the study’s success.
According to the Prosecutor General, due to the leak of information, the suspects received essential knowledge for them.
Lutsenko added that he was personally acquainted with Gandziuk and was outraged that some politicians exploited her blood for public relations.
“So that no one has reason to say that someone is interfering with the government, I want to state that I am making a statement to resign.
Today I will present it to the President of Ukraine and you will have to consider this issue in Parliament," Mr Lucenko's speech in Rada is quoted by the Obozrevatel newspaper.
It is written that Lutsenko added that "you cannot allow duality in the country when the law enforcement system collapses without any evidence, even for the crimes revealed."
Lutsenko is considered a close comrade of the country’s President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Attorney General on 12 May 2016 after prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, suspected of covering up corruption by top officials and politicians, from this post.
Minister of Energy <0xC5><0xBD>. Vai<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas meets with representatives of Orlen Lithuania
As Energy Minister Aurelia Vernickait<0xC4><0x97> informed Elta, the meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and after 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that does not currently reach the EU-wide trajectories set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plans, with renewable energy accounting for 6% in 2015.
According to the EC, progress towards the mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to a variety of difficulties, including relatively high costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), and electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas has taken the proposal of corruption investigation questions to supplement the appeal of the conservatives to the KT
The Seimas on Tuesday, following the submission, approved such a proposal, which it registered for an investigation into the illegal influence on political processes led by the "state" Agn<0xC4><0x97> <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97>.
There were 58 members of the Seimas, 27 abstained.
The project will be further considered by the Seimas Committees, the main appointed by the Law and Order Committee headed by A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97>.
Following its conclusion, a vote will be taken on the adoption of an amendment to the decision.
The interim commission of inquiry of the Seimas, which is currently conducting a new investigation into political corruption, is instructed to explain the possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
<0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> proposed to extend this deadline, stating that "significant information has appeared in public space about the possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions".
In the draft, <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> defines "possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Central Commission for Service Ethics".
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by the opposition conservatives.
The ruling "peasants" found that the conservatives had largely relied on the arguments of private pension fund lawyers in their appeals.
With the impact on the Central Commission of Service Ethics (CEC), the leaders of the "peasants" accuse former colleague Povil Urb<0xC5><0xA1>i.
According to them, the former chairman of the Seimas State Management and Municipal Committee could have appointed the members of the VTEK to dismiss the former head of the Prevention Division of the Commission, Mindaugas Siauris.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to explain the possible illegal influence of the parties or their groups on the election process, on the formation of coalitions, on the work of parliamentary factions, on the work of individual politicians, on the activities of parties and social movements, on public relations and on the financing, on the cleaning of legislative processes,
It is also proposed to examine what information law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to the competent authorities as a response to it.
The researchers are expected to present their findings by May 1 next year.
There will be an election campaign for the President of the European Parliament.
Out of the 12 members of the commission, seven are "farmers" representatives.
Its members were also appointed by two social workers, one by one "organizer", a liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian Polish election campaign-Christian Family Union.
Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the committee.
The new study was initiated by Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, Chairman of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union.
According to him, the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGK) investigation conducted during the last session showed that the investigation should be continued, in principle, on the same issues.
Germany's intelligence chief has lost his job.
55-year-old Maassen has further fueled the controversy by saying his troubles were the fault of a "radical left-wing force" in Merkel's coalition.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but was forced to go into reserve.
Last weekend, it turned out, among other things, that at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organizations held in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Mr Maassen criticized Merkel's "naive" immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has defended the intelligence chief for a long time, told a news conference on Monday that Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and "disappointed" him personally.
Seehofer, who was pressured both by the dispute and by his party's poor performance in the Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Maassen to the reserve.

Hairy girls shatter stereotypes about wedding dresses
A chubby girl with a white bubble in a wedding dress - a mission (not) possible?
Can the white swans flying towards the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
Plus size reality show "The Great (r) Evolution" participants will already today prove that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on a woman's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the project girls will have tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the filming stage.
"There are those who think that older girls don't get the attention or looks of guys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me as I am, he doesn't require me to have a figure that meets any standards," Aurika said.
Wedding dress is not easy, in all senses, clothes - it is a complex construction, it contains a lot of material, the dress is difficult, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women believe that a larger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident in herself.
I can reassure you that a properly selected model of the dress really solves this "problem", - explained one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
In the project, R. Kalinkinas decides the fate of girls together with the entire commission - plus the size of the fashion house opened by Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social media star Nagliu Bieranca and TV producer Laura Pauk<0xC5><0xA1>te.
"Deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there is a lot of disagreement between the members of the commission - after all, we all represent different spheres and we imagine the winner of the show differently.
The task of demonstrating the wedding dresses has made it even more difficult and this - I can now reveal - that two newcomers have appeared, who certainly are not inferior to the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense,” Kalinkin said.
The 23-year-old, who was famous for her scandalous behavior in a summer reality show, and the 31-year-old mother of exceptional beauty, two children, Dovil<0xC4><0x97>, as well as other girls, participated in the selection of "The Great (r) Evolution" and entered the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session of girls in the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls returned to the show by LNK viewers, voting for their favorites on the TV portal.
The beauty reality show in Lithuania, which has received international recognition, is already taking place for the second week - here plus-size girls compete for the name of the first star in the country plus-size.
So far, there are only eight of them - and they all know perfectly well that there can only be one winner.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "The Great (r) Evolution" starts already this Monday evening at 20.30 pm via LNK.
Actor I. Elba elected the sexiest man in the world
People magazine has named him the sexiest man in the world this year.
He is the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that this message was unexpected in telling about the new title, he did not give up the gossip.
I thought, "You can't be!
Seriously?".
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought, yes, today I look sexy, laughing at the actor sharing.
Speaking openly, Idriss pointed out that this title was an extremely pleasant feeling that enthralled his ego.
The British star believes he has often received insulting words and jokes, which made his childhood difficult, because, as he calls himself, he was "very tall and clumsy".
The young actor was dissatisfied with his peers and became the object of mockery due to his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"I've just grown your moustache and I've become the toughest guy in my city district," Idris smiles.
When a man loses his place on the big screens, I. Elba works as a dancer at parties held in Spain, and especially in the bustling Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a shoelace of fashion, which he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor believes that the most important thing in the world is his family, so he plans a wedding with his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the 33rd most sexy man in the world in People magazine.
The title was awarded to Blake Shelton in 2017.
Man beaten to death in snorkeling area
On Monday evening, a man was beaten to death while drinking in the village of <0xC5><0xA0>alki<0xC5><0xA1>ki<0xC5><0xB3> in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>irvint<0xC5><0xB3>.
According to the Vilnius County Police, at 21.16 a.m., a report was received that a man beat a neighbor during drinking.
Upon arrival, doctors found the death of a man born in 1943.
A suspect born in 1994 who was found to be 2.53m drunk was arrested.
Police are explaining the circumstances of the incident.
Managers no longer require a distance of 20 km when building waste incineration plants
A Vilnius cogeneration plant is being built near Gari<0xC5><0xAB>nai Market.
Managers no longer want to maintain a distance of 20 kilometers from the settlements when constructing waste incineration plants.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, head of the environmental protection committee, registered an amendment to the Law on Waste Management in the Seimas on Monday, which rejects such a requirement.
According to Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikos, the "peasant" faction, which has previously supported the provision on the 20 km distance, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikas’ amendment provides that from January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built to meet the requirements set out in the laws for the protection of the environment and public health.
He acknowledges that the amendment has raised the president's doubts about such a ban.
"Given the definition of residential area, it is obvious that such a place where the above-mentioned objects could be built would be almost impossible to find," the committee chairman said.
The ruling majority in October opposed the president's veto amendments tightening the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants closer than 20 km from the settlements, the amendments allowed the government to make decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account public health interests.
Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika does not propose to amend the latter provisions.
Lithuanian Energy Group is building a waste and biofuel-generated power plant in Vilnius and Kaunas together with Fortum, a Finnish energy group, is building Fortum Heat Lietuva.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
Talks about a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and Ireland’s leaders discussed a possible compromise on Monday to resolve a difficult issue in Northern Ireland that stemmed from Brexit talks, Dublin said.
Speaking by phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered an opportunity to revise the so-called Safeguards Agreement mechanism, which would allow for an open border between the UK's Northern Ireland province and the European Union's Republic of Ireland.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to consider the proposal but has rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the deal, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the interview, May "revealed an opportunity to review the mechanism of insured measures," it said.
"Varadkar has made it clear that he is open to the review of new proposals, provided that the result of such a review will not be linked to a unilateral decision to discontinue the use of insurers," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators do not find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland border when Britain pulls out of the single market and customs union next March.
Both sides agree on "insurance measures" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger-scale trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional border checks are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied temporarily to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is seeking Britain to withdraw from the insured measures agreement unilaterally after three months.
Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government “cannot support it.”
"Three-month or limited-term insurers are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels did not confirm information about the breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations after the announcement that the deal was reached by hand appeared in Britain over the weekend.
"I would say that we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to do," May's spokesman said in London.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schin told reporters: "We're not there yet."
Nobel laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of eminent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a statement on Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the online age.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen (Amartya Sena) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglitz), a Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Laziosata), as well as nomads.
"We call on goodwill leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate, through which citizens can make decisions based on facts," the group said in a statement.
They argue that the “global space of information and communication” is a common good that “must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and views.”
"People have a fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated on the basis of truth of commitment, principles of pluralism of approaches and rational methods of fact-finding," the statement said.
The document seeks help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who often criticizes "false news" but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
World leaders should express their position on the issue when they meet at the "Peace Forum" in Paris on November 11-13, the signatories called for.
The statement was made within two months, led by Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Christophe Deluar), the head of the Paris-based media freedom and journalist rights advocacy organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao, and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
The Seimas has approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Act, which stipulates that the fines for product safety violations must be increased.
The amendments were approved unanimously in the Chamber.
As the Seimas Health Committee member, Antanas Vinkus, said on the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives are related to better protection of consumers of products.
Its provisions are also aligned with the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, in the proposed bill, is better and more specifically distributed to all the contractors involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, because entities that have paid fines continue to commit repeated infringements," Vinkus said.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after the government’s approval, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The legislative amendments aim at increasing penalties for infringements, strengthening consumer rights protection, empowering market surveillance authorities and creating a clear framework for monitoring product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities are not granted the right to access the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises, to carry out inspections during the state control of product safety, which makes the work of the authorities more difficult.
In the Ministry's assessment, the six-month deadline for the award of fines and warnings is too short to identify the violation, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the penalties imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - in 2017 alone, 14 companies did so.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product, thereby ensuring its traceability, to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to have access to the territory, buildings, premises, inspections and inspections of operators who manufacture, supply products to the market, carry out public product safety checks.
It is intended to increase the fines for violations of the law.
A fine of EUR 150 to EUR 2 500 (now 144 to EUR 1 448) would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who placed dangerous goods on the market and the distributor who supplied them to the market who provided or provided the dangerous service.
A fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,000 (now between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>868 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,344) would be imposed on the Public Consumer Protection Authority (PSRA) or other market surveillance authority if it decided to prohibit the placing on the market and the supply of dangerous products or services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them would result in a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 2500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 6,500 (now between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 1,448 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 5,792).
A fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000 (now between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,448 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,5584) would be imposed if dangerous products have harmed the health of the consumer.
A fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000 (now between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,792 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,169) would be imposed if dangerous products caused the consumer's death.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to 25,000 euros (minimum fine is not fixed), in Belgium - from 26 euros to 600,000 euros in Romania - from 155 euros to 612,666 euros - fine - from 612,500 euros

The baby saw the world thanks to a cesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
They have been under medical supervision for some time.
It is still some time before the young mother with the child will be released home.

Norway’s Armed Battalion Participated in NATO’s Outermost and Toughest Areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces participated in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital Oslo.
This is part of NATO’s “Trishake Connect 2018” exercise, the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the soldiers from the second Norwegian military battalion spent a lot of time away from home after the September 11 terrorist attacks, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But most of all, they are skilled at fighting in the Arctic, and these skills are of great use now that NATO is shifting its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and harsh areas, soldiers have taken part in staged battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wilderness, but in a harsh climate they have to pull a much higher weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
The soldiers at the headquarters say that they share their skills in how to survive and fight under such conditions with other NATO soldiers.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, like no other in particular, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

I am a shareholder in several companies and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with my family," Maciulis said.

Maciulis has not yet had the opportunity to speak with U<0xC5><0xA1>ack after he lost the initial elections of the Union of the Motherland-Lithuanian Christian Democrats to Ingrid <0xC5><0xA0>imonyta on Sunday.
“To be honest, we haven’t been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team yet and talk about future plans.
It is obvious that after Vygaud leaves the further election fight, this stage of my life is over," Maciulis said.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas policy on support for V. U<0xC5><0xA1>ack, only regretted that "Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a true leader in the context of international relations".

He is a shareholder of the private school "Erudito Lyceum" and several other companies.
Workers in Kaunas Castle: What are they doing here?
The Kaunasites, when they saw the workers flapping in Kaunas Castle, were shocked that the reconstruction of the remaining tower was finally underway.
The director of the Kaunas City Museum, Gabrielius Su<0xC5><0xBE>iedelis, believed that work on the replacement of the roof of the south-west tower with a fragment of the defensive wall was taking place here.
According to the speaker, the roofs will be canned.
“Wearing the can coating of the emergency caused a threat to the surrounding environment – people could have jumped and injured – so it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so the heritage was also damaged," the museum director explained.
Will these roofs be similar to those that were several centuries ago?
"All works are combined with heritage and other institutions," - G. Injured added, seeking to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time important and practical side - roofs must protect values from moisture.
When working with heritage, a universal solution is chosen.
Before that, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered with tin in the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value," the director of the Kaunas City Museum said.
The contract was signed on October 2nd.
It is planned that the work will not take longer than three months from the signing of the contract.
"It is expected to be completed by the end of November," the museum's director said.
According to him, the value of the work carried out amounts to almost 24 thousand euros.
This amount, according to the interlocutor, was foreseen in this year's budget.
Work in Kaunas castle is carried out by the company "Statija".
Kaunas. diena.lt has written, as according to the conducted research, Kaunas castle may have looked earlier.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a television interview that criminal measures would remain until Pyongyang renounced nuclear weapons.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet with North Korean envoy Kim Yong Cholu in New York this week.

The Centre for Eastern European Studies will cooperate with two major US “brain centers”
According to Lino Kojala, the head of RESC, based in Vilnius and already counting for thirteen years, the acquisition of the US will allow the implementation of projects and will make the voice of Lithuania more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that the two major institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that there will be niches in the activities, because the topics of development of NATO, security, disinformation and Eastern Partnership countries that we are analyzing are also priorities for them," Kojala said.
The agreements note that RESC and US institutions will work together in the preparation of international project applications, exchange of expertise and knowledge, and hold expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
The FPRI has been in operation since 1955 and unites nearly a hundred top-level analysts.
In the latest University of Pennsylvania Global Ranking of Analytical Centers, the FPRI ranked seventh in its category.
At the time, CEPA, whose analysts have been invited to consult and work at the top political institutions in the United States, ranks ten in the same category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the US information space and will encourage us to raise the quality cartel," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be the help of partners in distributing the upcoming analytical publication RESC Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review to US decision-makers and to the public.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of projects implemented and no targeted grants are maintained.
Among the RESC partners with which joint initiatives are implemented are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseille
Two people were easily injured in the collapse of two buildings in the southern French city of Marseilles on Monday, the fire department said.
When the buildings collapsed, they saw debris in the street, and dust clouds rose.
Dozens of firefighters worked at the scene near the famous old port of Marseilles, some with trained dogs.
The local prefecture on Twitter posted photos showing a pile of debris and wooden beams, a huge gap in the place where the buildings stood, firefighters working at the scene, and cars covered in a thick layer of dust.
Officials said they were looking for people who might have been in the rubble.
Marseille firefighters said on Twitter that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
The amateur video, which was shown on BFM-TV, showed dust clouds in the street and sleeves covered the mouths of passers-by.
Google Street View photos taken prior to the incident show that one of the collapsed buildings was five and the other was six stories high.
One of these buildings was clearly in poor condition, stained with windows, with large cracks in the facade.
Mayor Sabine Bernasconi said one of the buildings was in poor condition and was ordered to be evacuated.
However, the mayor could not rule out the possibility that the building might have been used arbitrarily by the people who lived there.
The region's prefecture has called on people to evade the site and clear roads for rescue services.
The mayor of Marseilles said the building was in poor condition and was ordered to be evacuated.

Mexican Restaurant Helps Deported Migrants From the U.S.
The further away, the more Mexicans are deported back, and they find it difficult to adapt when they return.
“When I was deported, they took everything: the house, the car, the clothes.
They took everything, except one thing - my knowledge," said Victor Hugo Hernandez, the restaurant's director.
The restaurant’s board hopes that the merging of Mexican and U.S. cultures will foster a better understanding of each other.
Afghan special forces officer shoots down U.S. instructor during training
North Ogden, 39, the mayor of Salt Lake City, went on a year-long vacation to complete a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a U.S. military intelligence officer, but was due to return to work as mayor in January.
Another member of the U.S. military, whose name has not yet been released, was injured in an attack Saturday that claimed Taylor's life.
According to officials, Taylor died of a gunshot wound to the infantry.
The commander of the Utah National Guard, Major-General Jefferson S. Burton, told reporters that Taylor had helped train and strengthen the capabilities of the Afghan National Army.
Yuta media quoted a NATO report that Taylor was shot dead by one of the trained special forces soldiers and that the attacker was shot down by Afghan forces.
Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His support is due to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday evening.
He had previously carried out two missions in Iraq, and this mission in Afghanistan was also his second.
In January, before departing for Afghanistan, Taylor told local media that he had been assigned to a team of advisers and instructors of the country's special forces battalion.
Hundreds of North Ogden residents gathered on the streets of a city of about 17,000 to slither their mayor, accompanied by a police escort card.
B. Taylor's mayor became mayor in 2013.
