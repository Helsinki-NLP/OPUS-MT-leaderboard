The Welsh extra deputies are concerned about what they look like marionettes.
Some MPs do not understand why their parliamentary status should be changed to the status of a "Member of Parliament of Wales".
Deputies were outraged by plans to change the name of the local East to "Parliament of Wales".
Politicians from all walks of life think it's a bad idea.
One Labour MP said that his colleagues are concerned that this is rhymed with the words "stupid" and "negative".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "stupid" and pwp means "negative".
She said that her group was completely dissatisfied and offered alternatives.
Welsh Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss the change of the name of the East, but noted that it was a brief verbal transition from a member of the Welsh parliament to a "marionette".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on the draft law on amending the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the deputies of the East call will, of course, be a question of the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals, which showed broad support for calling the meeting the Parliament of Wales.
As for the title of an additional deputy, the Commission preferred Members of Parliament of Wales or CNC, but the CPU option received the most support during public consultations.
Additional deputies obviously offer alternative options, but the way to reach consensus could be a headache for the mayor, Elaine Jones, who is expected to present a bill on the changes over the course of several weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the work of the assembly, such as the rules on the disqualification of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the system of committees.
Additional deputies will hold a final vote on the question of what they should be called when they are carrying out their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters voted to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
The national vote was organized with the aim of resolving a multi-year issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represents a claim on their territory, which has hindered Macedonia's inclusion in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opponent of the renaming referendum, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is just a cost to pay for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
St. Martin's Church is silent, the Boccherks in Harlem are fighting for their existence
“In the past, as the old people I spoke to said, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"There's no one here today."
He said that the disappearance of the bar was understandable.
“People have different relationships and relationships at the moment,” he said.
"Bars are no longer cosy local lounges, where people walk all the time."
As for the churches, he is worried that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for the long period of time that leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by living houses with candaminiums filled with people who would not help the temples that would remain in the area.
"The vast majority of residents who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore it will accelerate the day when these churches close together, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who will move to these condominiums will become pregnant."
Both churches were built by a community of whites before Harlem became a black district – the Church of the Holy See in 1870, the Church of St. Martin – a decade later.
The original white-methodistic commune left in the 1930s.
The black community, which was praying nearby, received the right of ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was seized by the black community under the leadership of the like-minded John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants at the main shopping mall in Harlem, 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
The fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but the faithful under Johnson's father planned a reconstruction: they put the carillons into operation.
David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "the poor people."
The expert, who played at the carillon in July, called it otherwise: "Cultural treasure" and - "an irreplaceable historical tool".
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first in the world to play blackscore musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the bigger carillon 18 years ago at Riverside Church.
Mr. Mereveser said he was not replaced in St. Martin's Church.
What has happened in St. Martin’s Church over the past few months has been a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom have been attracted by false church leaders, others by the diocese.
The Assembly of the faithful – the governing body of the parish, which consists of assistants of the chaplain, – wrote to the diocese in July with caution that the diocese "try to transfer the expenses" to the Assembly of the faithful, although the meeting did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors, which
Some residents complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving to catch lobsters in California.
On Saturday, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was hunting lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near the beach of Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends for half an hour when he heard the boy screaming, begging for help, and then swam with the others to help pull him out.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a thrill from a lobster hunt, but then he "understood that something bad had happened: 'I was bitten!
“I’ve been bitten!”
"His whole key was broken," Hammel said, adding that he noticed it when he approached the boy.
I yelled at everyone to get out of the water, "In the water next to the shark!"
The boy was airlifted to Reidy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The nature of the shark that attacked the shark is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Lara Giles, told a media briefing that the shark had been spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe variety.
Giles added that the victims suffered injuries to the upper part of the torso.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Esinita for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening beauty departments in department stores where trained professionals will work.
As part of the significant promotion to the British beauty market with a turnover of 2.8 billion pounds sterling, which continues to grow, while the volume of sales of fashion clothes and household goods is going to decrease, more large houses of beauty will also be introduced.
Investments in the field of beauty come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the space on the shelves that were previously occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury's has said it will double the volume of beauty products, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will appear for the first time.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in corporate departments similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
Large stores are also relaunching their Boutique line of cosmetics, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is becoming more and more in demand among young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will be testing a license at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will open in Sale Owl (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Purchasing online and moving to buying small quantities of products daily in local stores around the house leads to the fact that supermarkets have to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coupé, Sainsbury's CEO, said trading points will be increasingly similar to supermarkets as the network of supermarkets tries to compete with discounters Aldi, Lidl with the help of more services and groceries.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores, as well as several Habitats points since it acquired both networks two years ago, which it said contributed to the growth of food sales and made the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarkets to rebuild their beauty departments and pharmacies did not end successfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to split revenues from pharmacy stores ended after a series of checks at supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business three years ago, along with 281 Celesio stores, to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy network for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It has been reported that Lloyds has played its role in this regard by expanding the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We’ve changed the look of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in the training of our employees, who will be able to offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any need, and the attractive environment and convenient location make us the best home of beauty that stands up to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones was thrilled after Holly Willoughby renounced the <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal.
Dragons star Peter Jones was thrilled after TV host Holly Willowby dropped out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his brand, which specializes in the image of life, to focus on her new I and Marks.
There is no time for a brand of home goods and accessories Truly.
The business couple became similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old star announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now parting ways with her lucrative branding business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was upset when the "golden" TV girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow (Bakingemshire), that her new deals will be worth up to 1.5 million bucks.
The business was similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand and was doubled to double Willowby's wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: Truly was Holly's top priority.
It's the long-term future she'll see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to resign from the party left all the participants in complete dismay.
No one wanted to believe what had happened on Tuesday, and very soon dinner had to start.
The Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the leader of This Morning, which is among the most important British stars, can cost companies millions due to huge investments in various goods – from pillows and candles to clothes and household goods, and also from
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to John and his wife, Tara Cappe, for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the board of directors in March.
The couple rests together, and Jones owns a 40-percent stake in Baldwin's television firm.
Willoughby will be a representative of the M&S brand and will replace Aunt McPartlin as the leading ITV "I am famous".
Last night, a source close to Jones reported, "We're not going to comment on his case."
A sincere conversation, “After we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism that he receives from the media for his comments, which he considers "non-presidential" for the fact that he speaks positively about the North Korean leader.
Why do you think President Trump is doing a lot of things?
Trump said with his paradoxical “dictator” voice.
“I’m not denying anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was announced by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Li Ying Ho told the world's leader at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North was not expecting "appropriate action" by the U.S. in response to the warning.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
“We are very successful in building relations with North Korea,” he said.
“Everything could have ended in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the completion of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of U.S. troops home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about the relationship with Kim.
“Being on the side of the president is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to break into this crowded arena, we’re already going to have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia have devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake in the village of Lambok, foreign NGOs were told that they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lambok have been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary condition for the provision of international assistance.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it was a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work on the site.
Mr Sutopa, a representative of the National Agency for Combating Natural Disasters, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if the international agency will be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that have always plagued Indonesia, the country is still well-prepared for the unexpected nature.
Although there were shelters built in Aceh, there were hardly any in other coastal villages.
The apparent lack of sirens to warn of tsunamis in Palu has led to more casualties, although the warning was there.
Even in the best of times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia was a difficult task.
Natural disasters have complicated the process of relocation.
The hospital ship, which was located on the village of Lambok for the treatment of earthquake victims, is approaching Palu, but the way to the new place of disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidoda has focused his campaign on improving Indonesia's devastated infrastructure and has spent money on highways and railways.
But the lack of funding is chasing the Jockey's administration, as there will be new elections next year.
Mr. Joka is also facing pressure from ongoing interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where representatives of the Muslim majority embrace a more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
Watch: Daniel Oldy from Liverpool kicks the ball away against Chelsea <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Daniel Oldy saved Liverpool from Chelsea's loss in the Premier League, equalizing the number in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
The old man received a transfer from Girdan Shakira when they were about 30 meters from the wing of the Chelsea goal, which ran with a score of 1-0.
He made a shot with the ball to the left of himself before making a shot at the far pole.
The attempt ended with a shot high under the top bar when the ball flew into the right upper corner of the net.
As a result, the ball flew over the head of Capa Arissabalaga, who jumped directly into the net.
"He was just trying to get into this position to push the ball, and players like Chuck have always been trying to push as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible," Oldie said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that running Kante, made an easy pass, not thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball."
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the start of the second half after Belgian star Eden Azar was knocked out in the 25th minute.
Attacking the "blue" in this match made a pass to Mateo Kovacic before returning to the half-defense zone and running in the half of the Liverpool field.
The squirrel quickly found himself in the middle of the field.
Then he made a spectacular blow, passing the ball to Azara at the goal.
Azar evaded the defender and broke into the lower left corner near the long bar near the Liverpool router by Alisson Becker.
"Liverpool" competes with "Napalm" in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 o'clock on Wednesday at the stadium of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet Videoton at the UEFA Europa League at 3 a.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Agency for the Elimination of the Consequences of Natural Disasters reported on Sunday morning.
At a press conference, a representative of the agency Sutopa Purvo Nugroha said that according to reports, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake force of 7.5 points, which occurred on Friday and a hail.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, has been dormant with debris from destroyed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after he shot a woman.
An investigation into the murder was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, MS.
A 44-year-old woman was found dead at 7:55 a.m. with pressure injuries in the Grayson-Muse area on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called for people to come to them from the area who have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead or saw or heard anything suspicious, and they asked me to contact them.
I also call on all, in particular, taxi drivers, video recorders who may have taken some video, to contact us as they may have information that is of paramount importance to our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
Today, the woman's friends came to the scene of the incident to ask: where was she found this morning?
Investigations are ongoing, and the police said they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mouse, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will be a few more hours before they are allowed to return.
The police explained to one person that the entire area is now a crime scene.
The woman was crying at the scene of the incident.
She said, “It’s so horrible.”
At 14:00, two police vans were in the fenced perimeter, another van was outside.
Several police officers were standing inside the perimeter, investigating the apartment building.
All who have the information should contact the police department <0x40>MerPolCC, call number 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously at 0800 555 111, naming the record 247 from September 30.
The Parliamentary statue of Cromwell became the last centuries-old hit in the matter of "rewriting history".
His removal would be a poetic justification for his Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, made by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Cry's proposal as "stupidity" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the course of the current debate about the dismantling of the statue, it was inevitable that the monument to Oliver Cromwell near the Palace of Westminster would be the object of these actions.
The battle of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Mr. William Ham Tornicroft's vivid presentation of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century thought and part of the historiography of the actor, which many believe still needs to be respected.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many Cromwells have known better since the late 19th century than they do today, as a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation, the subject of a long-standing historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually cognitive figure who represents one of the sides of this confrontation.
His accomplishments as a Lord Protector also deserve to be honoured and honoured.”
The killer pig was kidnapped to death by a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in the southwestern part of China.
“The man known only by his last name, Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and swollen blood, near the swollen Lupanshui market in Guizhou province,” the South China Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farm was preparing to introduce a swine vaccine at a pig farm in Xinjiang, China, on May 30, 2005.
He, along with his cousin, is reported to have come from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that the door to the neighboring porch was open.
He said that there was a large lump of blood in the piggy bank.
According to the report, a forensic medical examination confirmed that the 550-pound cane had deformed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were exposed and damaged,” said the cousin named Wu (according to a Guiyang Evening News quote).
The video from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pigeon was closed to prevent an attack on someone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene of the incident.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although cases where pigs attack people are rare, they have been in the past.
So, in 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, as a result of which the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig pressed a Welsh farmer to his tractor and held on until his wife dumped the animal.
After a farmer from the state of Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a downpour.
“They’re just lazy.
They're smart and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane "Rose" will bring heavy pouring rain to the southwest of the United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, "Rose" will bring flooding in northern Mexico and in the southwestern United States.
The speed of Hurricane Rosa, a Category 1 hurricane, was 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was recorded at 385 mph southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
"Rose" is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific Ocean begins to form an area of low pressure, moving east, to the western coast of the United States. If on Monday "Rose" will approach the coast of the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm.
On Monday, "Rose" will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall to some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity, which interacts with the incoming low-pressure area, in the coming days will cause strong rains in the south-west.
In places from 1 to 4 inches of rainfall causes dangerous sudden flooding, rural flooding, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to the fact that the amount of precipitation in places will reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially in most of Arizona, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected.
Due to the decentralized areas of tropical rains, a sudden flooding is possible under the condition of rapid deterioration of conditions.
It would be very undesirable to go on foot in the desert due to the possibility of the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can cause the canyons to turn into turbulent rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by swaying winds and dust.
The looming low-pressure area will bring heavy rain to places in part of the coast of Southern California.
Possible total rainfalls of more than half can lead to a slight flow of debris and make the roads slippery.
This will be the first rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday before rains go everywhere at the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, there may be strong temperature changes in the United States, as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
In some cases, this will lead to a sudden change in temperature in the near future.
There is a good example of a sharp temperature drop in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City (Missouri State), and Amachi (Nebraska State), St. Louis, and Des Moines (Aiova State), the temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to strengthen and expand again.
In many central and eastern U.S. states, a warm October is expected to begin with a temperature of 80 degrees — from the South Plains to the Northeast.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cowan's hearings.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched interesting testimony Thursday in the Supreme Court case between Brad Cowan and Christina Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, which allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political opposition continues, broadcasters have interrupted their regular programs in favor of the extraordinary news on Friday: an agreement developed by Arizona Senator Jeff Fleck's Office of Intelligence for the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cowan had caught her and tried to take her clothes off for a high school party.
In his heartfelt testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was 100% sure that this was not the case.
More than 20.4 million people, which the Nielsen company reported on Friday, were likely looking at it.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And in the company Nielsen usually have problems with the evaluation of the people who watch TV in the offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing a playoff or an Oscar.
"Fox News, whose experts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, managed all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day," Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
“CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million,” Nielsen said.
The interest remained high and after the hearings.
Flake was the main character of the drama on Friday.
After the chancellor of the moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote in support of Cowan, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when protesters were yelling at his address and when he tried to raise his voice on the phone.
He was standing with his eyes closed for a few minutes when he was lamented, and it was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have power, but many women have been robbed of it."
Flake said his office had published a statement and said before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the committee's hearings.
All cable and broadcast networks for a few hours carried a live broadcast, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on the issue of the nomination of Kavanaugh at the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he would do so, only realizing that the FBI would consider charges against the candidate next week, which Democrats among the minority are calling for.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After a conversation with Kuns and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was strong, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have a vote to approve Cowan without an investigation.
President Trump has begun an investigation into the FBI's allegations against Cowan.
UK Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of 'Game in Politics' Due to Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
During an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, that they are "walking in politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party's conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In one of the interviews next to her at the front of the newspaper was her former foreign minister Boris Johnson, who spoke out against her so-called "cheap" Brexit plan, saying that the proposal to have Britain and the EC had "no single tariffs".
The murder of Wade Sims: Police have arrested LSU player Dieton Simpson, who is suspected of being killed.
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana team.
"The 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson has been arrested and placed in prison on charges of second-degree murder," Baton Rouge police said in a statement.
Officials showed a video of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the shooting.
“Police removed the glasses from the scene and said they had Simpson’s DNA on them,” said WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he confessed to the death shot in Wade.
“The cost of the institution is set at the level of $350,000,” – reports Advocate.
The eastern administration of Batan-Rose has published a preliminary report on Friday, which says the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department of the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the state police's criminal laboratory, and the University of the South police are asking residents of the district for help in an investigation that would facilitate the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Allieva, thanked the district's law enforcement for "care and commitment to justice".
Sam was only 20 years old.
Attacking 6 feet tall, he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the University of Louisiana team.
On average last season he scored 5.6 points, 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the coach of Louisiana University’s basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was “devastated” and “shocked” by Wade’s death.
"That's what I'm always worried about," Wade said.
The volcano erupts ash in Mexico
The ash erupted from the Papacatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Warning on Saturday offered Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater became active and within 24 hours, 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were recorded.
There was a squeak in the center and there was a squeak.
Images on social media showed that in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko, there are thin layers of sandstone coating on the car windshield.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the southeastern capital after an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after supporters of independence clashed with the police on the protection of public order, and thousands more joined the demonstration in the name of the first anniversary of the polling poll.
A group of separatists wearing masks, held back by the police for the protection of public order, threw them with eggs and blossomed with powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that same day, the fighting broke out when the police used their branches to detain the demonstrators.
For several hours, a group of independence fighters chanting "Don't forget, don't forgive" met with the trade unionists present, shouting, "Long live Spain."
According to local press reports, 14 people have been treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to the report.
Tensions in the region, which is striving for independence, remain high a year after the referendum on October 1, which Madrid declared illegal, but which the Catalan separatists noted.
Voters overwhelmingly preferred independence, although the voter turnout was low, which was largely explained by the boycott of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region as a result of the actions of angry demonstrators.
The pro-independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police.
The protests continued, but the protesters were forced to take a different path.
The 68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who is present at a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes for Catalonia's independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I’ve seen my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we’re tired,” he said.
Despite the vitally important, but negligible victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties, who are in favour of independence, have tried their best to keep the momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders and leaders.
The 42-year-old mechanic, who is recording a protest in support of the police on the phone, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting tougher,” he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in SIZA since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Exclusion as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men Arrested After Hurting a House on a Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in the Belinoghard-Crestent area at around 19:30 British time on Thursday.
Detective-inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, a bullet may have been fired into the car.
As a result of Mango's blow, Livingstan wins over Rangers with a score of 1:0
Manga's first goal in favor of Livingstan secured them a win
Livingston's success acclaimed the Rangers, and this was enough to nominate Stephen Gerard after his several defeats in 18 games to the position of manager of the club Ibrox.
The impact of Manga's fate was great, as Gary Holt rose to one level with the Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team won't win this season in the Premier League and next Sunday will meet with the leaders of the team, the Harts, who are behind by eight points.
Prior to this, "Rangers" in the Europa League will host on Thursday the Vienna "Rapid".
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended its win-win series in the division to six games, and head coach Holt is still feeling a loss after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingstan" misses the chances because of rough visitors
Holt's team should have warned long before they were killed, but that same direction has caused Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his chance to kill at the gate, after which Alan Lithov was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Hulkett's blow.
The hosts were happy to allow the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb the guests at some point.
That's how the main goal was achieved.
Rangers were allowed a penalty kick, and Livingston made a debut, with Deklan Gallagher and Robinson teaming up to defeat Meng, who made a pass and shot from the center of the field.
By this time, Rangers had dominated, but it turned out that the defense of the team was inappropriate, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was practically not involved
The same thing continued in the second half, although Alfredo Marélas did indeed save Cale.
The ball from Scott Pitman was rebounded by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and the Litgows were away from the second set of Livingston.
The balls were constantly hit in the gate of Levingston and were rebounded, while the two demands of the penalty shooters, after being summoned to replace Glen Middleton, and the demand for a penalty for the game by hand, were rejected.
“Phenomen” from “Livingstan” – analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alesdeir Lamant at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for “Livingstan”.
For men, they were wonderful, continuing to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have practically not changed since their return to the higher echelon, but it is worth giving the right to Holt for how he stimulated the team from the moment of his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett was grandiose, building a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Waral on the field everywhere.
The Rangers didn’t get inspired.
No matter how good they were at Gerard, they didn't meet this standard.
In the last match they did not own the ball, only hitting the goal once, which was something of a distressing call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the list.
A mixed attitude towards Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, smiles were seen and unfounded flying sensations were felt when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at re-establishing relations between NATO allies.
They got worse because of problems with human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EC.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an went to Cologne to open a new giant ballet.
This city is home to the largest proportion of the Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police relied on security considerations to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their views, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The pro- and anti-protests reflect disagreements over the guest, who was declared a hero by some German Turks, while others were condemned as an autocrat.

The driver died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bethwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, the doctors arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another rider was killed in a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of the Saturday crash.
The police said they were working hard to identify the man and to report him to his immediate family members.
Around that place there are road fences and bus stops, and the motorists were recommended to avoid this area.
Prison "Long-Lartin": Six employees injured during riots
“Six prison officials were injured as a result of the disorder in the prison of a strict regime for men,” – reports the Penitentiary Administration.
The riots erupted in the prison "Long Lartin" in Wustarshry around 09:30 British time on Sunday and continue to this day.
To combat the disorder, in which eight prisoners are located in one wing, the special group "Tarnada" was attracted.
At the scene of the incident, the staff were treated for minor injuries.
A representative of the Penitentiary Service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been directed to fight those who have committed riots in the Long Lartin prison.
Six of the patients were treated after they had been injured.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the culprits will be handed over to the police and can spend more time behind bars."
The Long Larcin Royal Prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was undergoing treatment in the hospital after the attack of the prisoner.
And in October last year, police officers for the protection of the public order were summoned to prison to deal with the serious disorder, during which the employees were attacked with balls for the water polo.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with severe flooding (which may be beneficial for arid regions)
Tropical storms rarely occur in Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week, because traces of Hurricane Rose are left in the southwestern part of the desert, posing a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already on Monday and Tuesday published data on sudden flooding in western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Fethiye.
It is expected that on Tuesday "Rose" will go straight through the Phoenix, approaching with rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or pressure drop within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the border with the state of Arizona.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts a drop in rainfall from 2 to 4 inches, with levels in some places reaching 6 inches in the Magallanes area of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with individual result values reaching 4 inches.
For those who are beyond the risk of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa could be long-awaited, as their region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be useful, as droughts are currently observed in the southwest.
According to the U.S. agency for drought monitoring, at least a little more than 40 percent of the territory of Arizona is experiencing an extreme drought of the second category,” reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to slides on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and will therefore cool off.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm arrives, rivers will flow from the shores during the day or in the evening on Monday.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico can be strong, which creates a significant risk of flooding.
“A total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected from Lower California to northwest Sunderland, where it is possible to fall as much as 10 inches,” reports weather.com.
The Rose will then move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the borders of Arizona early in the morning on Tuesday in the form of a tropical drop in pressure, which will then continue the movement through the Arizona and southern part of the state of Utah.
"The main danger is expected from the Rose or its remnants, it is very heavy rain in Lower California and in the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and rural streams and slides in the mountainous locality.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four Attempts to Arrest Murderers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with multiple press injuries in Summerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Taras Excelsior area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a “stable” condition.
“A 17-year-old boy and both 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested overnight in the Redstock, Avon and Somerset neighborhoods,” police said in a statement.
The police appealed to anyone who could have any evidence on their mobile phone of what had happened to advance in their quest.
“Cavano is acting out of the submissiveness and anger of the Democratic Party,” Trump said.
“The voice for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for the abolition of the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffering from the submissiveness and anger" of the Democratic Party in the process of his removal from office.
Cowano testified before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying Christina Blaise Ford's accusations that he sexually assaulted her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearings about her indictment.
On Saturday, the president said that "on this day, Americans saw a brilliant, high-quality and courageous character" Cowano.
“The voice in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for one of the most perfect experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer with a great history of public service,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president pointed to the election of Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of the image of the Republicans during the interim elections.
“Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections of our time.
“I’m not just late, I’m really late,” he said.
"That's why I'm fighting all over for big candidates."
Trump disagrees that the Democrats intend to “oppose and obstruct.”
“It is expected that the first key processional vote at the Senate level on the removal of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday,” a senior aide to parliament’s leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims is increasing
“At least 384 people died, many people disappeared as a result of a surge of giant waves on the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi,” the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves six meters (18 feet) high swept over the coast in swarms, killing many to death and destroying everything in its path.
After the earthquake of magnitude 7.5, a tsunami occurred.
"When yesterday there was a tsunami threat, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run away, and they became victims," the press secretary of the Indonesian agency for disaster relief Sutopo Purvo told a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami dragged cars, barrows, houses, hitting everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km / h (up to 497 miles / h) before hitting the coastline.
According to him, some people survived only because they climbed the trees to escape the tsunamis.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers of Palu.
The aerial photographs, published by the natural disaster agencies, showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, the ointments rotated and collapsed, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The next round of fireworks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the area with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released as a result of the powerful earthquake on Friday is about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunamis.
Nogrokha called the damage "wide" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the debris of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing without warning.
"Victims and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake," Nugroh said.
The connection in Dongala "was completely damaged," Nugroh said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its employees and volunteers were sent to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could have been much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami in Palo, but officials say the waves came at a time when a warning was made.
In amateur photos, posted on social networks, you can hear the man on the top floor of the building shouting with desperation to people on the street warning of the impending tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water fell to the shore, dragging the buildings and cars behind.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to agree on rescue actions.
According to authorities, the soldiers began directing cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still very much needed food and other items of primary need.
The city's airport has been opened only to provide assistance and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Videa planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palo.
As a result of the tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people were killed
It's very bad.
“While World Vision employees from Dunghala successfully reached the city of Palu, where workers are hiding in the brittle hideouts set up in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of devastation along the way,” Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of broken homes,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even if the relief groups have begun grim actions to launch disaster relief mechanisms, some have complained that foreign workers with deep knowledge are being prevented from going to Paula.
According to the Indonesian rule, financing, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to accrue if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Ouliya Arriani, press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government declares, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we will be able to open up to international aid, but this status is not yet there.
On the second night in Palo, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of the missing without warning hoped that their loved ones would be among those who would leave the inhospitable storylines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the ruins for two days, and next to her was the body of her child.
Hendon Subandon, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were his disciples.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Hendon said that a few hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu participants who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with one gray dot, not two blue dots.
“This means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
The robbers stole $26,750 during the filling of ATMs in Newport on the Lev
“In the morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from Brink’s employee, who put notes in an ATM in Newport on the left,” the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money," wrote Det. Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, another man "escaped from Brink's employee" and hid the fur with the money destined for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses noticed several suspects who left the scene of the incident, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye (“you”).
Rapper Kanye West (Kanye West) changes her name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I'm officially known as Kanye West.
West, who is 41 years old, named Ye, used this name as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes take place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande with a show that has been canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Along with the abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously said that this word has a religious meaning for him.
I believe that “yes” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is “you,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album’s name with the radio host Big Boy.
I am you, I am you, I am you, I am you.
It came from Kanye, which means “one,” to simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good, our bad, our messiness, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced that he was leaning towards the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, Jay-Z, also ran unconnected and overhead.
AMLO in Mexico vows not to use army against peaceful residents
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Abrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday, in the square of Tlatelolco Plaza Lopez, Abrador promised "never to use the Hawaiians to subjugate the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shelled a peaceful demonstration in the square that killed about 300 people, while left-wing student movements spread across Latin America.
Lopez Abrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly grants to those who are studying, thereby opening more free places in state universities.
“Unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups,” he said.
The U.S. should double its funding for machine intelligence.
“As China becomes more and more active in the field of machine intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount they spend on research in this field,” says investor and machine intelligence specialist Kai-Fu Li, who worked at Apple’s Google.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about MI, even if the U.S. does not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China presented its plan: by 2030, it aims to be the first in the field of AI innovation.
“Doubling the budget for research in the ME area would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the US, and we are looking forward to the next breakthrough in the ME area,” Lee said.
"The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next great achievement will be in the U.S.," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Hawton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive of Sinovace Ventures, a company that has invested in one
In the 1980s at Carnegie-Melanie University, he worked on a machine-intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranking American player, Athel, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese office in China.
Lee recognized previous government technology competitions in the U.S., such as the Agency's Robotics Competition for a cutting-edge research project in the field of defense, and asked if there would be any next to help identify the next milestones.
“U.S. investigators often have to work hard to get state grants,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies in recent years have hired candlesticks from universities to work on me.
Lee said that a change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
“In my opinion, green cards should automatically be offered to a candidate in the field of ME,” he said.
The State Council of China in July 2017 released a plan for the development of the next generation of machine intelligence.
“China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people in educational institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other state organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of undergraduate work in Kyiv
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Machine Intelligence, in which partners from industry and scientific circles should participate, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Machine Intellect.
And this month, the Agency for Advanced Research in Defense announced a $2 billion investment called AI Next, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
As far as the National Science Organization (NSF) is concerned, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in research into AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to set up the National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence, has not observed the actions for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which will allow to resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which blocked applications for participation in the European Union.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory, and has vetoed NATO and EC membership.
In June, both governments concluded a deal taking into account the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Georgy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott company questioned whether the voter turnout would match the minimum of 50 percent required to hold a referendum.
The question of the vote in the referendum suggests: "You are in favour of membership in NATO and the EC with the adoption of an agreement with Greece".
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a cost worth paying for admission to bodies such as the EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivier Georgievskaya, 79.
Although it is not a mandatory legal force, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said that they will take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires more than two-thirds in parliament.
The state election commission said that no reports of violations had been received until 1 a.m. on the day of the announcement.
However, the figure was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Jose Tanewski, a 62-year-old voter in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zaritsa and his son Duska voted for a referendum in Macedonia, devoted to the change of the country's name, which opens the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and laid out chairs in front of tents set up by those who will contest the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want unity with the heads up, not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have the honor.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I think the overwhelming number will be ‘yes’ because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the “yes” result will be a “confirmation of our future”.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies says that between 30 and 43 percent of the electorate will take part in the referendum, which is below the required figure.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's TV channel showed 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy-seven percent of them said yes.
For a successful referendum, the voter turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western government's policy since its arrival in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguera from Manchester City passes to the gate through the entire defense of "Brighton"
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of defending against Brittany by winning Manchester City with a score of 2: 0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
At the 65th minute, Aguero did it with ease.
The Argentinian striker received a pass in the center of the field.
He tried between the three defenders of Brittany, before hitting the open field.
At the same time, he was in the midst of four green shirts.
He went through one defender and beat a few more on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed the pass to the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English attacking first touch in the penalty gave the ball to Aguero, who used his right-handed shot to bypass the goalkeeper of Brittany Matthew Ryan by hitting the right-hand side of the net.
“Aguerra has some problems with her legs,” Pep Guardiola, the head of the city, told reporters.
“We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
“We were lucky to have him at the same time.”
But it was Serling who gave Sky Blues the initial lead in the fight in the Premier League.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received this ball in the depths of the territory of "Britain".
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sean made a few touches before Sterling was able to reach the far pole.
Attacking the Sky Blues, he pointed the ball into the net before it jumped over the border.

Sherzer wants to play the role of "selecting points" against Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from the competition in the playoffs, there was no particular reason to pursue a new start.
But consistently competitive Sherzer hopes to take a hit on Sunday against Calorada Rocky, but only if there are still play-off consequences for Rocky, who remain in the lead after one game with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the South.
The years have won at least a single place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday evening, but are still hoping to get their first division title.
"Even though we're playing just like that, at least, we can handle the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here, in Denver, with the crowd and the other team will come together so that the game is likely to be at the highest level from the bottom of it.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced the start of Sunday, but are reportedly prone to give Cherry the ball in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was going to make his 34th start, held a CPC session on Thursday and will be on his usual rest on Sunday.

Trump's speech in West Virginia
The president pointed to the situation around his election of the Supreme Court of Bret Cowano, talking about the importance of the representation of Republicans in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not late, but I’m really late, so I’m everywhere fighting for big candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using any necessary means, you see, – arrogance, abomination.
They don’t care who they offend, who they have to break to get power and control, it’s what they want, it’s the power and control that we’re not going to give them.”
According to him, the democrats are intent on "resisting and obstructing".
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, ugly, reversible and lying.”
He appealed to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the previous recognition of Senator Diana Feinstein of the Democratic Group, who received a loud rating from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the document to escape?
Uh, what.
No, I don’t expect it – it was a very bad nonverbal language – the worst language I’ve ever seen.”
Work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It's an intolerance to those who express their opinion.
If the momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of parliament from the Labour Party, who are told that we are not welcome – everything to express my opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar appeal because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship exposed me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the irony of fate, there are similar issues on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
A statement on the meeting, which was held on Friday by the Nottingham East Labour Party, said that "we want these meetings to be both local and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party, it was this meeting that took place on Friday.
Unfortunately, today at most meetings the tone is not the same and the promise of a "better, softer" policy has long been forgotten, if ever there was.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that in the Labour Party different views are not allowed, and each opinion is evaluated from the point of view, whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because colleagues, with whom I previously believed that I share the same political views, began to wait for me to take a step back, and took a position with which I would not be able to do anything.
Every time I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there is a lot of outrage on social media, calling for the election to be cancelled, condemning the center’s policies, saying that I’m no longer in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I've been luckyr than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me, as a rule, are political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a daily stream of sexual or racist insults, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that adheres to different views, and with each movement of “uncertainty” or change of the rules of selection the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I've been given a lot of advice that urged me not to give up, not to be so loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, led by the government of Thatcher, because of which my education in the school has failed, I have tried to defend the best state services for those who will have more.
I've never been able to hide my political views, even in the last election.
No one in the East Nottingham could be mistaken in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that when a country is heading for Brexit, which is detrimental to the household, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and strength on my loyalty to the Leaders.
But in fact the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my constituents, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of revoking the election will ever be a political target.

Air Merrows 38 - 17: The Invincible Air at the Top
Two later attempts may have spelled out a few final results, but, no doubt, Air deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Premier League match of Tennis.
Now they are leading the tournament table, the only side out of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, as well as their best chances that made them hosts, coach Peter Mercy Merch had every right to be satisfied.
"We've still tried our games so far, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Mellowes said: "Give Airo what he deserves, he's braver than we are.
A 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, portrayed by Fraser Clima, put Ira in the foreground, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the game Warriors, allowed Melrose to juggle the numbers behind the numbers.
Klimov stretched Ayr's leadership with the help of a penalty kicker before, right in the pause, he killed and then made a solo attempt, making 17-5 Ayr in the pause.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed into Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruard Not, which was stretched, and after a restart, Air advanced further through an attempt by Stafford McDowell, implemented by Clima.
Air, fulfilling the duties of Captain Blair McPherson, was given a yellow card, and again Marrows forced another person to pay with the help of Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt at the end of February pressure.
However, the hosts came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for knocking out Klimov without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson landed behind Ayr.
Klimau made his attempt, which he did again almost after the restart, after Kyle Rowe had David Armstrong hit the penalty box and sent flanker Gregory Henry to the field's fifth attempt.
Star Still Game seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, the star of the game Ford Kieran is going to enter the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular show, which he writes, and is filmed alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the series of shows, and it seems that Kernan plans to act further after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun's source suggested that Kernan hopes to take part in "the thriving trade in Glasgow".
"Our Sea": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific
Marrakesh is patrolling the military-marine headquarters in La Paz.
The city's buildings are under the blue flag.
In the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto "Our Sea on the Right" is painted.
Restoration is our duty.
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict due to the resources of the 19th century, is still alive – as is the desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have peaked in the last decade as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalsadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the Foreign Ministry on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague, after decades of tense negotiations, supports Bolivia's statement that Chili is obliged to conduct negotiations on the sale of goods.
Eva Marales is the charismatic president of Bolivia, who faces a conflicting fight for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and that's little to change, even if it does.
The United Nations, which is based in the Netherlands, has no right to take a decision on Chile's territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes out only six months after the final arguments were considered, shows that the case "was not complicated", - said Chilean expert in the field of international law Paz Zarathe.
And far from advancing the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have pushed it back.
“The problem of access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Bolivian administration,” Sarat said.
According to her, the militant rhetoric of Marales has lost the remaining Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after that, it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring “an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Kalsadilla also denied that Marales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – had used the naval problem as a political backing.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“This is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't take place until they can trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ry Yong Ho, says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
He spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders.
His comments come as the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming nuclear deadlock diplomacy with North Korean Kim Jong-un more than three months after Singapore.
Rye says it's an "unforgettable dream" that prolonged sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration to end the war in Korea will ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to the declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps to disarm at first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are calling for a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is taking seriously the denial of an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At Paris fashion shows we saw the latest line in massive headgear on the way to stores in your cities.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the podium a number of unusual headwear for their SS19 collection, which exceeded the expectation of Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has won the popularity of impractical hats, the designers of which sent their creations to the podium.
The distinctive feature of Valentino was a luxurious beige hat, decorated with wide, feather-like poles that filled the heads of the models.
Other accessories of extraordinarily large size included precious stone watermelons, a magician's hat, and even pineapple, but they were not intended to keep the head warm.
Brown also showed a selection of wisely-made masks – just before Halloween.
Many of the multi-colored masks were with sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One of them resembled a raft for underwater swimming with a tube and protective glasses, and the other – similar to a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue to strongly adhere to the huge attributes of fashion, you're in luck.
Those who follow the style, predict that huge hats can break into our daily lives.
Large hats go on heels to "La Bomba", a straw hat with poles two feet wide, which can be seen in all, from Ryana to Emilia Ratajkovsky.
A cult label for a very uncomfortable hat, which was released in social networks, contributed to another great creation on the podium – a straw beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag, dressed in a swimsuit.
A dark orange raffia bag, finished with a raffia border and covered with a white leather handle, has become a prominent part of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer has made a big impact, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have maintained their achievements in academic success, it has continued since 2018 with another outstanding exam result, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music, and other fields of study.
More than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are committed to providing a better level of work for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to remain a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you talk to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a vivid reminder that we can't rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of the last exams this year, we see that languages occupy the first place in the league tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest A-rating.
Data collected in 74 participating schools of SCIS showed that 72% of students achieved a higher grade A in the study of the Chinese language, while 72% – those who learn the German language, 69% – the French language, and 63 percent – the French language.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Now languages as a subject are chosen in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons that employers caused difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming a necessity in order to prepare young people for the future career.
With more promising jobs that require language proficiency, these skills are becoming a necessity in a globalized world.
No matter which profession you choose, if you learn a different language, in the future it will be a real advantage if you have such skills for a lifetime.
The ability to connect directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in the first place among competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak well enough in a foreign language to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage – 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
The availability of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more chances to find a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages taught in it.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in terms of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with a teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages are still vitally important for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as “skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and preference to Scotland's youth.
It's got to be done
John Edward – Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is set to debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The start of the wait for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing at a pre-season opening match Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How long it will last, however, has yet to be determined.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell wrote that James is likely to play in a limited time.
According to the practice developed this week, James was asked about his plans for "six game pre-season schedules".
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins a series of campaigns for the company.
This is the first of Trump's five planned speeches next week, including stops in friendly locations, Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the approval of the vote on the arrival of the elections to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to strengthen the support of the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of the Congress if they go head-to-head.
When does Trump's speech begin tonight in West Virginia and how do you view it on the Internet?
Trump's speech in Willing (West Virginia), scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia on the internet below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider this week's candidacy hearings at the Supreme Court for Brett Cowano, who has problems with allegations of sexual misconduct with the Senate's expected confirmation of the vote during the week's FB investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to provide assistance to the Republicans, who stand before the elections in November.
Thus, President Trump's campaign announced that these five speeches next week are aimed at "activizing the activity of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority, which they are.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, as we enter a tense campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Planned at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing, today’s event can attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is a leader in the polls.
“It’s not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try to give him a boost in polls,” said Simon Hedar, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Rider's Cup: U.S. team advances to fight to keep hopes alive on Sunday
After the three one-sided sessions of the fourth Saturday, perhaps it was just what was needed for this Ryder Cup.
The pivot of the momentum that fluctuates is a completely fictional sports concept, in which players sincerely believe, and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where would they say impulse now?
“They had a six-point lead, and now they’re four, so I think we’re going through it with a little impulse,” Jordan Sleepy said, strolling through the day.
Europe's advantage, of course, is four points ahead, and in the game there are twelve more.
The Americans, as Spits says, feel that they've had a slight gust of wind, and they have a lot to hope for, not least because of the shape of Spits and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each can boast three points out of four.
The site was deadly from t-shirts to green and is an example.
These gargantuan cries of celebration grew louder as his round lasted, and he submerged a resolute blow to play in the four-field matches as they went down two by two with Thomas.
His shot, which allowed them to win in the 15th game, was met with a similar scream, such as one that tells you that he believes the American team is not excluded.
“You just have to dig deep and worry about your own game,” Spicy said.
All of these players are out of the game.
18 holes to make a mark.
Over the past two days, the only players who have earned more points than Spite and Thomas are Francesco Millinary and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Rider's Cup.
Weird, but magical couples in Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
The Malivud were the only couple who did not make gods on Saturday, the second half of the day, but they also escaped the gods on Saturday morning, Friday and the second half of the day on Friday.
This is happening, and as their energy seems to flow to and from this tumultuous crowd, and it affirms that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close the potential victory of the National Golf in Europe.
Both are desired at the same time in different holes.
The debate about the European Union's future is still ongoing.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson did a short stint on Sergey Garcia, the hero of the morning's Furshet when he was paired with Alex Noreen.
Boggi and the two twins on the front nine dug a Spaniard and a Swede for him, with whom they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
After the matches of four balls and fours it is so interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the composition of pairs, the parade they give, the parade they do not perform, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has so far become the best team and has taken on a significant role in the last day, but this fourth session also shows that the U.S. team is striving for a fight that some have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe to reach the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe will get a good lead on the last day of the Rider's Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by the duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Millinary, he led the fight with two wins over Tiger Woods to bring the results at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bourne's European side, striving to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, reigned in the U.S. Dissatisfaction Agency this morning, receiving a 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in four-ball matches, winning two games, but they couldn't do more.
In order to keep the trophy, Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and the Millennials, who were named Molliwood after the sensational outings, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four Cowboys games.
After batting Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they were wonderfully solidified to defeat the downed Woods and American rookie Bryson Decombe another 5 and 4.
Woods, who played himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random burst of shine, but now he has lost 19 of 29 times in four-ball and four-match matches and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested on x four-ball matches, returned to Henryk Stansen's partner in four-ball matches to defeat 2 & 1 Dastin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – occupies one and the other place in the world.
Europe did not have its way, although it was a pleasant, fresh day south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time top scorers Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set a checkpoint for the Americans with two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter of Spain in four-ball matches and came back later to defeat Pulera and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has returned from a deficit of four points, which goes alone, although the owners of Furyk only need to draw to save the trophy.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if they will succeed.
North Korea says that "no way" will disarm in one-sided order without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations is continuing sanctions that strengthen distrust of the United States, and under such conditions, the country can not give up nuclear weapons in a unilateral order.
RY Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the world body that last year North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill", for example, the cessation of tests on nuclear and missile sites, the dismantling of the nuclear test zone and the dismantling of nuclear weapons.
“But we don’t see an appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves in the first place.”
Despite the fact that Ri republished the usual North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to the "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea was rewarded, as it was reluctant to take gradual steps, his statement
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on the path to "denuclearization of the Korean side."
North Korea has sought to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call for the lifting of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States of America first insists on ‘denuclearization’ and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even opposes ‘the declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an unforgettable dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the participants in this issue of denuclearization were not South Korea, not the U.S.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was sharply different from last year when he spoke at the UN General Assembly asserted that targeting the U.S. continent with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after Trump's "Mr. Price"
This year in the UN Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that there will be a lot more to do, and the sanctions should remain in force until then.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a time frame for it, saying, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are arguing in the UN. The Security Council said that it is worth rewarding Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, the Secretary of the United States. Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions should actively and necessarily continue until we are sure of a full, final and verifiable deal."
The Security Council tightened sanctions on North Korea in 2006, trying to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the corridors of the Security Council. The General Assembly then said that next month he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that the progress made with North Korea over several hours of negotiations ended with a visa statement saying he was making demands "like gangsters".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to eliminate the missile installation and the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
Trump said that according to Kim, the “appropriate measures” he expects are a guarantee of security and an effort to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking a course on the right rest.
The new course at Harvard University this year is designed to teach students more sleep, and aims to combat the culture of studying at night with coffee in hand.
The scientist concluded that students in one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to properly take care of themselves and their health.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he began the course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did they only tell me this now, in the last lesson?"
“She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — it surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course, taught by students, explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting achievement, as well as improve the overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health care service, said the university had decided to introduce a course after it found that students were often relieved of sleep.
The course, which lasts an hour, includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a room on the internet where students click on coffee cups, curtains and books that tell about the impact of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports performance, as well as the importance of habits.
At the full stage, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus, with interactive images, invites participants to think about their daily lives.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they need to know this as much as everyone knows about the health consequences of smoking,” Professor Chaisler added.
According to him, the culture of the evening still exists, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students lead to sleep deprivation, which is an increasing problem.
"Ensuring sufficient sleep of good quality should be a 'secret weapon' for students to fight stress, depression, and anxiety," he said, "even to avoid being overweight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly slow."
Raymond Cohen, a 19-year-old Californian student who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chassler develop the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to teach everyone on campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to request all aspirants to complete a similar study programme before enrolling in the university.
Professor Chaisler recommended students the opportunity to install a clock to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, realizing the harmful consequences of the "blue light" that is emitted from the screens of monitors and LED lights, which can be changed every day.
Livingstan 1:0 Rangers: Menga hits Gerardo's goal.
The Rangers suffered another defeat when Doly Mangi's goal assured that Stephen Gerard would not be defeated 1-0 at the Livington Stadium.
Ibrax wants to record his first win on the way to a 4-1 victory in February at St. John's, but Gary Holton's team is already carrying a second defeat to Gerard as a manager with 18 games to leave the Hebrokes on their side.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, did not look like they suffered a defeat.
At the same time, as the Rangers descended to sixth place, the Livington rose to third place, behind the Hibernian with a difference in balls.
For Rangers, additional problems may arise after forward Colum Spence has to deal with a head injury after he has an object thrown from the tribune.
Gerard made eight changes to the players, which is why Ira did not play in the semi-finals of the Batfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Left under number 11, which allowed them to take the item from the Hearts last week, and was thrilled by how well they had outdone their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but Liverpool made more attempts to shoot the ball.
They should have been killed two minutes later when Mengi first aimed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, and then the midfielder took advantage of this opportunity.
Jacobs Caigan's successful penalty kick led to the shooting of Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithov was able to strike a strong blow from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game were more hopeful to kill than demonstrated a good game.
Alfredo Marellas certainly should have been fined a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Lovells bumped into each other on the field, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept Columbia's complaints.
The Rangers managed to hit the goal only in the first half of the game, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly almost gave a goal to Lasan Kulibali and an effective attack by Ovi Ekhiaria.
Although scoring the first goal in the 34th minute of the left, it may have been against further active play, but no one denies that they have to demonstrate to the fans a good game.
Again, the Rangers couldn't break through Jacobs's gate.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Meng for an opportunity to kill at the gate.
Gerard replaced Kulibali at the break with Ryan Kent, and it had an effective impact when the attacker broke through to Marelas, but the impressive Kelly escaped and blocked the blow.
But Livingstan continued to please the visitors, playing the game that they liked, and Lithov and Hulkett continued to share the ball after a long confrontation.
Holt's side was able to prevail only in the last minutes, but McGregor played well to face Jacobs before Litgaw went to the reserve bench.
Rangers' replacement by Glenn Middleton happened again after a fine was imposed when he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson managed to escape.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter.
Page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PAGES... the day of the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which resulted in the appearance of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Names of the Crown, in which the seemingly infamous scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appeared.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to look for radioactive minerals such as uranium.

Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system “see” cancer cells.
A new cancer vaccine can help the immune system “see” bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine is designed to teach the immune system to recognize the bad cells that will be part of the treatment.
The method involves obtaining immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then the cells can "see" the proteins that are common in many cancer cells, and then re-introduce the auxiliary cells.
The trial vaccine demonstrates successful outcomes for patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was given the vaccine, which helps the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw that ovarian cancer disappeared for 18 months.
The method involves obtaining immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab so that they can “see” HER2 proteins, common to many cancer cells, and then being re-introduced.
This was stated by Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
“HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer cells that fight cancer of the mammary gland, ovaries, lungs and fat cat,” said Professor Berazofski.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and "teaching" them to reach cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West has started a discussion in support of Trump, bearing the title of the IAEA, after his appearance in the SNL.
Which didn't turn out to be good.
In the studio on Saturday night, Kanye West was dismissed after a speech where he praised the United States. President Donald Trump said he would run for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song in the evening called "The City of Adventures," when he was in the hat of "Make America Great Again," he spoke out against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“How many times have I talked to white people and they said, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’”
“Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time,” he said.
The SNL began a show featuring the lead role of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cowano's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during a hearing on Christina Blaise Ford's sexual assault case.
Despite the fact that the performance was not broadcast, West's words popped into the frame and were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rocco.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get rid of the West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They sneered at me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out there with that hat.
They've sneered at me.
“And then they say I’m dead,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner newspaper.
West continued: "Do you want to see a vicious place? "Speaking that he" put my cap on Sperman, which meant that he couldn't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to make love.
Due to his statements, the hearings were suspended at least twice, and the representatives of the SNS were confused by the message from Veraiti. "The whole studio is silent".
West was accepted as the replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Party, Candes Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous in spirit Thank you for your support."
But leading the talk show, Karen Hunter, wrote that West is just who he is, and it's always wonderful.
“But I have decided not to reward anyone by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his ‘art’, which I believe embraces and promotes an ideology that is detrimental to my society.
He's free.
Just like us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "officially named Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and has followed in the footsteps of Djiddi, also known as Puff Djiddi.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was nicknamed Snoop Lion and, of course, the music legend, who changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist, formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted murder in restaurant "Belfast"
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a second man was attacked in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balikhamor, police said.
The indictee is expected to appear in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the State Prosecution Service.
The star of "Game of Thrones" Keith Harington captured idealized brutality.
Kit Harington is known for his swinging sword and the role of John Snow in the series "Game of Thrones" in the wartime medieval raw material HBO
But the 31-year-old actor received a macho hero stereotype, which means that young boys often feel tougher for respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture Department, Keith said he believed “something happened” and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
Cat, who recently married his Game of Thrones neighbor Rose Leslie, who is also 31, has admitted that he feels the power to solve this problem.
“I feel personally strong guy – when we were wrong with the courage”? – he said.
“Why do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of attitudes that we see now?”
Cat believes that television must be responsible for the appearance of brutality due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What lies in the beginning, and why is it taught?
Why do they teach on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they need to be so confident to be a real person?
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time – how are we going to change that?
It's obvious that something is going on with young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that next summer the series will end, and he will leave the show's battlefield and will not do any duels or sequels to Game of Thrones.
From November onwards, Cat will begin the rebirth of True Western Sam Shepard, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a slave.
Recently, the actor said that he considers a meeting with his wife Rose the best opportunity to complete "Game of Thrones".
"I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life here," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character in love with the character Keith John Snew in this fantasy series, awarded "Amy".
The couple were announced in June 2018 at Leslie's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases by 14%
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as was the case in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is spread in some areas of China as a result of infection through blood transfusions.
"However, the number of people infected with HIV through blood transfusions has fallen to almost zero," Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV infection through sex is an acute problem of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination in relation to LGBT people still eats.
Due to conservative values in the country, about 70-90% of men who have sex with men, eventually marrying women.
Many diseases are prevalent due to insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies the wrath of the adders, the danger and the conspiracy theory of her parliamentarians
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed accusations that her co-worker had posted personal information about three U.S. Senator-Republicans on Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said there are claims to the right-wing participants and their websites.
“A lie, a lie, and a lot of disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is reported to include U.S. home addresses and phone numbers. Meaning. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on the Capital Hill during a hearing of the Senate commission on sexual harassment charges in relation to Supreme Court member Bret Cowano appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The incident took place some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
"Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source's IP address was linked to the Waters office and shared information with the Waters team employee," Hill said in a statement.
“This unwarranted claim is completely false and absolutely untrue,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team, whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded assertion is utterly false and utterly untrue.”
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ary Fletcher.
“This denial provokes anger,” Fletcher wrote.
This shows that she doesn't have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of not doing it, they shouldn't get angry.
They don't have to behave badly.
They should not question the motives of their accusations.
They need to be calm and calm.
Fletcher compared Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh when they were accused of being too spoiled during Thursday's hearings.
Amar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is running and participating in the midterm elections, also made a statement on Twitter.
“It’s a renaissance when it turns out to be true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities to these false statements.
“We guarantee that the culprits will be found,” she continued, “and they will bear legal responsibility for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any of my team’s employees.”
A review of Johnny English Strikes Again strikes at fictional spy Rowan Atkinson.
It has now become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new film with a British slant, and this slant appears to be in the comedy and action franchise of Johnny Inglesh, which began as early as 2003 with Johnny Inglesh and continued into 2011.
Is it possible for us to express ourselves in a positive way about how stupid we are when we talk about the new possibilities of exporting?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, incompetent Johnny English was given the opportunity to laugh at things – his name was louder than all the comic creations he had made for non-English viewers in cinema.
It is known that he is a secret agent who, despite his cunning pretensions to glamour, turned out to be a bit like Clouseau with the traits of Mr. Bean and a little bit like a guy who made a single note in the Choir of Fire at the 2012 Opening Ceremony.
Originally his character was based on a wanderer and the international mysteries of Atkinson, who once played the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
There are a few pleasant moments that haven't happened before.
I loved Johnny English, who was approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the blades of the rotor were knocking a little at his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for theatrical comedy is vividly demonstrated, but the humor feels weak, and so it's surprising especially when serious films such as Agent 007: Mission Imperfection confidently offer comedy as the main part.
Humor feels like it's not just for adults, but for kids, and even the senseless accidents of Johnny Inglesh aren't as inventive as Atkinson's silent films in the face of Bean.
For many years now, the UK has been facing a number of serious problems.
The cyber-hacker has penetrated the super-secret community of British spies in the UK, revealing the names of all British agents on the scene, to the disappointment of a duty agent – this is, unfortunately, a small role of Kevin Eldan.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is a proud and mixed-minded actor who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can with this Quasi-Teresa May, but there's nothing like that in the script.
Her intelligence consultants say that since every real spy will be uncovered, she will have to involve one of those who are already in retirement.
And this means that for Johnny English himself, everything is complicated: now he works as the sixth teacher in several fancy institutions and gives lessons on how to be an uncovered operator: some good examples are in the English language, because the English language offers academia.
English returned to Whitehall for an extra briefing and reunited with his former longtime friend Bo, who is played again by Ben Miller.
Currently, because of my marriage, tied to the commander of the submarine, the role of which Vicky Pepperdin performed a little in vain.
Thus, Batman and Robin get terribly wrong things in the secret agency of the Queen, where they work again, meeting the beautiful woman Volga Kurylenka.
Meanwhile, the prime minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve problems with UK hackers: with the sinister Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bow begin their action with immediate things: disguise themselves under the officer, set fire to a French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight with smugglers on board a luxury yacht Volta's cabin; the Englishman is doing pure anarchy, bo
All the moments are drawn for the last event, but just as pleasant and noisy, in which there are quite a lot of children on the TV.
It's pretty good material.
And how about the other Johnny English films I couldn't think of: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being developed to pay the British a four-day working week with a payout of as much as five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan if the British work only four days a week, but they are paid for five.
It is reported that the party wants the heads of enterprises to pass on to the workers the results of the work done as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, giving them an additional weekend.
It has been seen that future employees are enjoying a three-day weekend, but will still receive the same earnings.
The source notes that the idea corresponds to the party's economic program and plans to direct the country to support workers.
The trade unions' congress approved the transition to a four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
The Labour Party's senior source told The Sunday Times: "The planned review of the actions will be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen now, but a four-day working week is an idea that corresponds to the views of the party and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse such an idea, the Green Party promises to spend a four-day working week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party's efforts are not supported at all.
A representative of the Labour Party said: A four-day working week is not the goal of party politics, and it is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John MacDonald used a working conference last week to express his view of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonald said he had decided to return power from "unforgiving directors" and "managers" to communal enterprises.
The shadow chancellor's plans also provide that the current shareholder of water resources may not get back the entire package of shares, because the Labour government can make a "calculation" based on the alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it is planned to add workers to the boards of companies and create joint equity funds to transfer 10 percent of the private company's own funds to workers who will hold annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy told 60 Minutes that FBI investigators working with Covano must change their mind.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been postponed to a final vote on his removal to the Supreme Court for at least a week. The question arises whether the Bureau of Republican Senators will be able to report the findings.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pally, a 60 Minutes correspondent, asked Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about the "Sense": Can the FBI reveal anything that could lead to change?
Kennedy was more outspoken than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said, going to the court hearing: I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and asked him about the reason for the accusation, asking, "Did you do this?"
“He was a snitch and a snitch.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be final.
“I think Bret Cowano decided it would be a scandalous accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Bret is resolutely denying it,” Graham added, citing Christina Blaise Ford.
“And everyone she calls couldn’t believe it.
She is only 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the International Festival of Citizens and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York is the International Festival: an annual music event, which has a very impressive composition of performers and performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, within seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will take place on the 30th grand lane of Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concert of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, and also learn about the events of the year.
The International Citizenship Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project against the scourge of an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty through an increase in the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket) the visitor has to perform a number of tasks or "take the action", be a volunteer, write an e-mail to the leader of the country, e-mail to the e-mail address and call anyone else.
But how successful has the Civil Festival been for 12 years and has it been able to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a priceless concert a real way to convince people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism” – people feel that they are doing a good thing by signing up online?
Since 2011, the organizers of the festival declare that they have recorded more than 19 million "shares" from their supporters, who are striving to achieve different goals.
It says these actions have helped spur influential leaders to meet commitments of more than $37 billion, which could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group provided 390 comments on commitments and claims amounting to at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or collected.
According to the group's estimates, the funds provided have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the provision of food, partnerships with investors and performers based in the United Kingdom, "helping children to develop in the full extent of the region", a promise to provide Rwanda 35 million.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eradicate the social injustice of malnutrition in history,” said Ambassador Tracy Ulman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the project "food aid" which reaches 5 million yuan.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “What makes you think we can end poverty?”
The global festival replied: It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will suffer defeat and failure.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Monae are one of a number of persoons performing at this year's New York event, which will be led by Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy for "blockade" to prevent the export of Russian oil and gas
"Washington can, if necessary, turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the EU and Middle East markets," U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zink said in a statement.
Zink claimed that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, are the basis for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to acquire energy just as much as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has an opportunity with the help of the navy to ensure the openness of the navies and, if necessary, to organize a blockade so that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less balancing and replacing fuel,” he said, calling Russia a “deep country” with an economy that depends on digging water.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration workers, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the “wrong” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a “captive” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is being created to double the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exceptionally economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's tough opposition to this project is taking off in the economy and is an example of incomprehensible competition.
"I believe that we have a single view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Mavek Peri in September.
The Americans received a blow in response from Germany, which once again reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industrial organization, the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrialists' Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between the Chancellor of Germany and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Elizabeth Warren is going to be very serious about her participation in the 2020 presidential election, says the senator from the state of Massachusetts.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would be serious about her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a speech in Halioki, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her participation.
“It’s time for women to head to Washington and organize our inactive government, and I’m also talking about women in the highest positions,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.”
During a speech in the city hall, Warren turned to President Donald Trump, saying that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
“I’m extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Cowano.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course, before the vote, it is necessary for the FBI to conduct an investigation."
However, the results of a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Center for Political Studies at the University of Safalek/Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support the decision.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick, where 38 per cent were in favour and 48 per cent were against.
Other well-known names among Democrats that have been discussed in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially take a decision by January.
At a rally in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic syndrome of Track Palin
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq following a call for service in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and indicted on charges of domestic violence.
"What my son is going through after his return, I can compare with the results of the traumatic syndrome and the injuries that our soldiers are returning with, in other families," she said as she gathered at the convention in support of Donald Trump.
Palin called the arrest a "painful issue" and said that her son, along with other veterans of the war, "returned a little other, hardened, returned with the question of whether there was the respect for which soldiers, pilots, other soldiers fought."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasil, Alaska, and has been charged with domestic violence against a woman, an obstacle to an attempt to report domestic violence, the wearing of a gun in a drunken state, according to information from Dan Bea.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new policy on the provision of ports
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies pressure from gangs or domestic violence in the port.
Representatives from 18 states and counties in Colombia filed an analytical note in Washington on Friday to support a dispute over the port's delivery policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the creature in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was unveiled in August by the American Civil Rights Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his friends with a hardcore gang" raped her, but U.S. authorities refused to do so at the port on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have received the largest number of port requests in the U.S., as countries that have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. port policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence to appeal to the port.
Columbia District Attorney General Carl Reysin said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of legislative experience of the states, the country and the world."
"Federal legislation requires that applications for the port be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle," the analytical note said.
The lawyers also said in a note that a policy that denies immigrants worsens the U.S. economy, saying that often immigrants can become entrepreneurs and "create the necessary jobs."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The port is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political views," Sessions said on June 11, announcing the policy.
The arrest never meant resolving the problems, even all the serious problems that people all over the world face every day.
Desperate rescue work in Palu. While trying to find those who survived, the number of dead has doubled
Those who have survived are in a very difficult situation.
“Everything is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother of Rysa Kusuma, reassuring her young son with the temperature in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the car "quickly" brings the bodies.
“The water is very small.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed houses, dismantling wet things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who ruptured the spine and shoulder, are outside Paul's Army Hospital, where patients are treated on the street due to strong repetitive thrusts.
Tears appeared in his eyes when he remembered the feeling of strong underground sighs in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“I didn’t have time to save.
I got squeezed under the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Threats’ Using ‘Propaganda Advertising’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the American daily, hailing the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China blamed the pskov in Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned China Daily’s paid addition to the Des Moines Register – the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the election in the U.S. Congress on November 6.
Trump's accusation that China was trying to interfere in the U.S. election signaled that U.S. officials in a conversation with Reuters called a new phase in Washington's pressure on China.
Although the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice for promoting trade, now Beijing and Washington have unleashed a trade war, which has resulted in the mutual imposition of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, U.S. and Chinese experts said, have been put in place to harm exporters such as the state of Iowa entrepreneurs who support Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, "is now doubling its efforts by printing propaganda advertisements in our free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the good American tradition of free speech and free press by printing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstead wrote.
"And if you look at the newspaper kiosks in Beijing, then there you will find not so many voices against and you will not see a real reflection of other opinions that the Chinese may have about the dangerous trajectory in the economy" is the point of the kiosk, which is taken into account by the fact that the press is
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers has declined to offer" to publish his article, although he did not name this newspaper.
The Republicans are pushing back women voters ahead of the midterm elections from the Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
While many well-known Republicans are defending a candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several accusations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will receive a blow in response, especially from women, during the coming months.
The emotions around this were very strong, and most Republicans are already showing that they are ready to vote.
"These things can no longer be returned," Grant Ryhar, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for the article, which was published on Saturday.
Ryhar said he was not sure whether Senator Jeff Fleck's statements about the FBI's investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, the chief adviser and national press secretary of the progressive group MoveOn, in a newspaper from Washington.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate Hall, when Republicans, who control the Legal Committee, decided to nominate Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the statement of Dr. Kristin B.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be extremely great," Stu Rotenberg, an independent political analyst, told the website.
“People say they’re high, and that’s true.
But they can be even taller, especially among women voters in suburbs and young voters aged 18 to 29, who don't like the president, but often don't vote."
Even before Ford's open statement, in which she detailed her accusations of a candidate in the Supreme Court in sexual assault, analysts believe that if Republicans insist on affirmations, there could be a strong blow to the response.
"For the Republican Party, this has become a mess," said Michael Style, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether to get Kavanaugh to the position. It's about how the Republicans dealt with it and how they treated it," the group noted news channel Guy Cecil, director of USA Priorities.
However, it is similar to the fact that the Americans were divided on the question of the right Ford or Kavanaugh, with the reason being a little more prominent than the last.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are confident or not very confident in Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they are confident or not very confident in Covano.
In addition, 38 percent said that, in their opinion, Covano may or may have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The FBI is investigating allegations by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, when he was drunk, sought her out at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court showed her her genitals at a party when they were studying in Eile in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global network, launches a startup that will become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is built on the open platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows the user to choose the location of the data storage and who has permission to access this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that by creating Inrupt, he meant "domination of the world."
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create "own repositories of data on the Internet" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, case lists, calendar, fanatics, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data repository on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this “a personal enhancement of the potential with the help of data.”
In the opinion of the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the ability to bring together resources, processes and the necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers working on a contract project, and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said he and his team had not spoken to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce full changes if all of their business models were immediately reviewed.
“We don’t ask them permission.”
In a Saturday issue on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in advocating net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Network Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Honoring the Priest Honored by the Victorian Cross in the First World War
The only priest of the Anglican Church, awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a participant in the battles, was celebrated in his city 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Van was awarded on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack at Belenglis and Leacourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper bullet and never found out that he had received the highest British military award.
On Saturday, in the town of Rashden, the county of Narthempanshhir, two of his grandchildren unearthed a memorial stone at the parade.
One of his grandsons, Michael Wang, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone opened just 100 years after his grandfather was awarded.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Van led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin "through a thick cone and under the strong rose and machine gun fire of the enemy."
Then he ran to the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldier forward, grabbing the gun on his own and knocking out three units.
Lieutenant-Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and just over a month later the war ended.
The 72-year-old Michael Wang said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never have done and also something worthy of respect.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van also made the wreath after the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said that "it is a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero was demonstrated by the support that many give."
MMA fans have been waiting all night to watch the Bellator 206, they have instead received the Pep's bell
Just imagine you've been out all night to watch the packaged broadcast from Bellator 206, and then you're denied a view of the main event.
The show from San Jose had 13 fights, including six on the main map, and they aired live all night on the British television channel Channel 5.
And in the sixth morning, when Gerard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing for a fight, watching in the UK was just astounded when the program changed at the bell of Pope.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night, especially waiting for this fight.
One of the dancers on Twitter called the switch to a children's cartoon as "someone's stupid joke".
Responding to a question about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said: "According to the state decree at 6 a.m., this content was inappropriate and needed to be switched to a children's program."
"Yes, "Pep's Pig."
Bellator company president Scott Cocker said that in the future they will be working on the program to account for British viewers.
"I think we're discussing the possibility of repetition, I think we can solve this issue," Cocker said.
"But now it's six in the morning on Sunday, and we can't solve this until Sunday at our time, and it's Monday at their time.
But we are doing our best.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we received a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the problem, considering that it was a technical error.
But it was a state decision.
I can promise you that this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to please the fans, but we're outdated.
It's a terrible situation."
'Discs of an Uninhabited Island': Tom Daley Feels 'Little' Due to Sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, said he grew up with feelings of insignificance to others because of his sexuality — but it gave him motivation on his way to success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand that "not everyone is like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's "Discs of an Uninhabited Island" program in lead Lauren Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give others "hope".
He also stated that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional leader of this rather old program, Kirsty Young, took a break for several months because of the disease.
In the role of a man on a deserted island on Laverne's first show, Dale said that as a child he felt "less" than anyone else, because "society did not accept those who liked both boys and girls."
He said: “I still believe that this feeling that you are not like everything and small, was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so that he would not disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist of the Olympics has become a significant activist of the LGBT movement and at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to live openly, without persecution and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American screenwriter, director and producer Dastin Lance Blacke, whom he met in 2013 – “it was unexpected for me.”
Dale married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but, according to him, the age difference doesn't matter.
"If you go through this at such a young age" - at the first Olympics he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer - he said that it was difficult to find an elder who would have experienced such a rise and fall.
In June, they became parents, their son was named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "perspectives have changed completely."
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you I needed to win a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.”
His son is also called as his father – Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale said his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to sit in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not immortal," he said.
The following year, Dale competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that's what I've been dreaming of all my life - jumping in the water in front of my teammates at the Olympics, that's the best feeling," he said.
It also influenced the choice of a song – Proud by Heather Small – which found a review in preparation for the Olympics and from which ants are still running.
"Disks of an uninhabited island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British summer time.
Mikelson, who is not in shape, remains on the spare bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Michelson on Sunday set a record, playing his 47 game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to return to form so that the event does not become unfortunate.
Michelsen, who will play in this competition, which is held every two years, a record 12th time, the captain of the team Jim Furyk sat on the bench of spares for Saturday forball.
Instead of being at the center of events, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time cup winner divided his days between the job of a cheerleader and training, hoping to return to form.
Even at the peak of his career, he was not the best player, and now a 48-year-old golfer is not the perfect choice for the difficult field of Le Golf National, where inaccurate hits are severely punished.
And if the field itself isn't dark enough, Michelson will be battling the exact British Open champion Francesco Malinara in his ninth game on Sunday, who, along with Tom Fleetwood, won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are behind four points at the start of 12 singles matches, start with success, Michelson's match may prove to be extremely important.
He was confident in the player, but he couldn't say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He is very self-confident.
He was admitted to the Hall of Fame and gave a lot of teams last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two games.
I was planning more, but it worked just the way we thought we'd play.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else.”
Mikelson will break Nick Fall's record for the number of games in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It may be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never been the same as the achievements in individual games.
In Michelson's 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furick said his presence brought the team a benefit.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, humorous, likes to joke about people, and he’s just a very good person to have on the team,” he explained.
"I think the younger players were happy to have his jokes, also this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the team a lot more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bourne knows that a major rift could soon disappear.
Thomas Bourne, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant gap in front of the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup, can easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in the 1997 game in Walderham, where the European team led by Sev Balesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished with a minimum lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that at Walderham we had a great advantage and won, but with difficulty, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost," said Bourne after watching the Class of 2018 win and the team won 5-6 in the fifth.
“History shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not the end.
We'll have to play 100 tomorrow.
Get out on the field and do it right.
As long as it's not on the table, it's not finished.
We have a goal and this is an attempt to win this trophy, that is what we will focus on.
I keep saying this, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that there are the best players in the world on the other side."
Satisfied with the way his players played on the heavy golf course, Bourne added: "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow's going to be another game.
Tomorrow is going to be an individual game, and that's completely different.
It's just great if you're on the field with a partner and everything is going well, but if you're playing alone, then this is where your true golfer talents come into play.
Here's what you need to tell the players that they have to show the best tomorrow.
Now we have to leave the partner, the holes have to go and also show the best as an individual player."
Unlike Bourne, his rival, Jim Furyck, hopes for a better individual game for his athletes than the one they demonstrated in a partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three aces.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these matches on the last day, playing in the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had a "Miracle in Medina."
“I remember every word of it,” he said, answering the question of how Ben Cransho, the captain of 1999, adjusted his players to the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we always want to have a quick start, which you have seen in Brooklyn and in Medina.
As the speed increases, the greatest pressure is exerted on those who play games in the middle.
We made the appropriate schedule and put the players as we liked. You know, tomorrow we'll try to get a little magic."
Thomas was tasked to start playing and play against Rory McElroy in the main games, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rum, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Paulter will play against the top golfers.
"I put my players in that order because I think that's how I'm going to close everything," Bourne said of his choices for individual matches.
The launch of a new German warship has been postponed again.
Germany's new navy frigate was due to go into service in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it will appear no earlier than the following year due to malfunctioning systems and steadily increasing costs, according to Meats.
The descent of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the all-new class of Baden-Württemberg frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting a military representative.
The ship was due to enter service in 2014, but the problems that have arisen after the construction hampered this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships, ordered back in 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with strong guns, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some "stales" technologies, such as reduced visibility for radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important features – longer periods between services – more new frigates may not enter their ports for up to two years.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships – which can allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country – will be obsolete until they finally enter into service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media has written about the many "defects in software and equipment" that make the ship useless in a combat mission.
The disadvantages of the software were particularly significant, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships have only 120 sailors – half of the crew of old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship has a very high weight, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of ships of the same class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the missing equipment, the price of the entire project – including the training of the crew – also becomes a problem.
The price reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) – although initially it was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that are accumulating with the new frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee in the German parliament, said that the Navy "has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions."
He said that the problem is increasing over time as the old ships are decommissioned and there are no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Society for the Protection of Monuments has listened to the secret life of bats
A new study, which is being conducted in the Scottish Highlands, aims to identify how bats use the landscape in hunts for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of unique flying mammals and help in future actions to preserve these animals.
A study by scientists of the National Society for the Protection of Monuments of Scotland deals with small bats and also storms long-eared bats of Dobanton in the gardens of Inver in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in the main locations of this locality to monitor the actions of bats during the season.
Employees of the Society and volunteers will conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all recordings determines the frequency of calls of bats, as well as which bats do what they do.
A living map and a report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Duarte, an adviser to the National Society for Conservation of Nature, hopes the results will show which areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of creating habitats such as meadows, and how to support forests for the habitat of bats and other related animals.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by the construction and development works that affect the place of residence and destroy them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as sticky tapes for flies and some chemicals for building materials. They are also threatened by domestic cats.
They say they're not blind at all.
However, due to their nightlife, bats' ears are more sensitive than eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a complex ejaculation technique to detect bugs and obstacles in the way of flight.
The National Society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, checks of places of residence and, sometimes, rescue activities.
The organisation has even created the first and only Scottish bat reserve in the Trive estate in Domfris and Galway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says that this is an ideal area for bats.
"Here, in Triv, we just have a great place for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about bats yet, so our work here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need for a better life."
He emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before carrying out property repairs, as it is possible to unintentionally destroy one saddle, killing up to 400 females and young bats, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
They are said to be under protection and are forbidden to kill, frighten, disturb or destroy their saddles.
Elizabeth Feral, an employee of the Fleet Protection Organisation in Scotland, calls on the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats, and many of the species we don't even know how their populations live."
Ronaldo has been charged with rape, and his lawyers are going to sue for a German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the accusations of rape "fake news," saying people wanted to "advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
Forward of Portugal's national team and Juventus was charged with raping American Katherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then he seemed to pay her $375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ronaldo appealed to 142 million of his subscribers hours after the accusations were published, calling it "fake news."
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s messages are fake news,” said the five-time owner of the Golden Ball in front of the camera.
“They want to do advertising in my name.
It's OK.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of my work.
I’m a happy and kind person,” he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a case in court against Der Spiegel on charges that they called "an inadmissible report of suspicion in a private case," Reuters reported.
Attorney Christian Scherz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damage in an amount that corresponds to the severity of the violation of rights, and in recent years this may be the most serious violation of personal rights."
It was as if the incident had taken place in June 2009 in the luxury room of the Palms Hometel and Casinos Hotel in Las Vegas.
Meeting in the nightclub of Ronaldo and Majorgo, it was as if they had returned to the footballer's room, where he had allegedly raped her anal, as written in the documents of the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after this, Ronaldo fell down and said that at "99 percent" he is a "good guy" who suffers from "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted that they had sex, but with the consent of the parties.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "very afraid of revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she now wants to reinstate the charge because she feels a moral injury in that case.
At the time, as if this case had a place, Ronaldo was going to move to Madrid's Real Madrid with Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italy's Juventus, closing the deal in 100 million euros.
BREXIT: UK “always regrets” the loss of car builders
The UK will “forever regret” losing its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clarke said in a statement.
He added that he was "concerned" by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cut production at a factory in Burnston, near Derby by half.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the delay at the border as a result of a no-deal Brexit could lead to a job cut.
The factory in Bernaston – where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made – last year released almost 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my opinion, when the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's director at Bernaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have raised the question of how cross-border trade will take place if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement. Among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, announces that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that automakers are talking about the risk of supply chains as a result of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “precisely on-time” basis when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions on the border, leading to delays and shortages of parts.
For Toyota, it will be impossible to keep a stock of parts at the factory in Derby for more than a day, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May’s “Checkers Plan” on future EU relations “is done precisely to avoid these border checks.”
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal that will not only allow today's success, but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The information we receive from not only Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicates that we should be able to continue the work of successful supply chains.”
The Toyota company has not been able to announce how long the production will not run, but warned in the future that the added cost will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and will lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Tsuvularis, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the union coordinator, said that union members are very concerned: "In my opinion, if jobs are cut, they will not recover.
The government's press secretary said: "We have proposed a precise plan for our future relationship with the EU that deserves trust."
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week", while a fight around a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Cowano, a White House official said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who studies Russia's interference in the election, Trump's ties to Russia, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
To fire Trump's assistant attorney general or not, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been pouring oil into the flames of Washington's plot for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office with the help of the 25th amendment.
Rosemary denied it.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid rumors that he was going to resign.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the UN headquarters in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't" want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashes at the Senate Legal Committee hearings, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment spoke.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Cowano's allegations, which further slowed down the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not yet set, maybe this week, maybe next. I think that, rather, a week later, all the other things that have a place in the Supreme Court case are taken into account.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the latest information. "
Some journalists are ready to dispute her claim: Sanders has not held press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, who runs the program, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the briefings was caused not to disparage television reporters who "work in public", although she added, "I agree with the fact that they work in public."
Then she said that Trump's direct contact with the press would increase.
"The president is holding more meetings with the answers to press questions than any president who has been to him," she said, adding without concrete facts: "We've studied these numbers."
Briefings are taking place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to directly ask questions to the president of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We try to do it often, you have seen how we have done it in the last few weeks. Such meetings, where you can ask a question directly to the president, replace briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions about whether he is leaving the White House or taking part in meetings on the street, or in press conferences with high-profile foreign guests.
The President's own press conferences are seldom held.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, when freely and sometimes extravagantly, he appeared before reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote to an employee from the EU countries in the health care system of Scotland before the Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to an EU employee working in Scotland's health care system to express gratitude on behalf of the country and to wish them to stay even after Brexit.
Jan Freeman sent a letter less than half a year before Britain's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government is ready to cover the cost of applications for residence from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on the departure of our country continued over the summer. They lead to the expected decisions this autumn.
But the British government has also rushed to prepare for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very difficult time for all of you.
That's why I want to remind you how much I value each employee's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in a Sunday game that his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores' 31-27 team, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Rudd told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He crossed the sideline and suddenly fell," said Ryd.
Trainers and doctors gave Abercomby oxygen while he was still in the field before putting it on the force and transferring it to make a diagnosis.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at the Vanderbilt medical center.
Harris added that there was "no detail as to what the injury was", and the Tennessee State is trying to identify when the player was injured.
Abercombe, a second-year sportsman, spends his first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full interceptions, giving him just 18 interceptions per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher levy.
According to the new plan, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher duty, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action neutralizes the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in the state tax rate is due to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance plans to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Today, Theresa May announced that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher state duty, and the extra money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters, as well as to keep affordable housing. It is aimed at high-income people.
The increase in state duty is aimed at individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the government's homeless housing program.
The increase in the current state duty, including the higher levels adopted two years ago, on the purchase of second homes and housing for rent, can amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new builds in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, this leads to higher prices and new buyers find it difficult to buy their first home.
Many rich regions of the country – especially the capital – have become “fashion cities”, because a large number of buyers, due to the border, most of the time do not live in the UK.
The new policy emerged literally a few weeks after Johnson's call to reduce state tariffs on young buyers to facilitate the purchase of the first home.
He accused the large construction firms of holding high prices on real estate by seizing land and not using it, and urged Ms. May to cancel quotas on available housing to address the "disgraceful situation with housing."
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of housing reforms, including the control of rents and the cessation of "baseless" evictions.
He also wants to give the local council more powers in the field of housing construction.
Ms May said: “Last year I stated that I would dedicate my job as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that life for every new generation should be made better.
This is a sign that we are improving our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is unfair that individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as working people in the UK.
For too many people the dream of having their own home is becoming increasingly unattainable, and the problem of the homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to manage the Scottish national team"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said that his main ambition is to one day become a coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old is performing the task of restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in third place in the First League, three points from the first.
He moved on to this job in the summer, after returning to the Scottish Premier League last season for the Saint-Mireens.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But it didn't work out," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"I grew up in Scotland with my father at the Hampton Stadium, and something always made me come back.
I’ll be able to do that when I’m a successful coach.”
Among Ross' predecessors as Sanderland coach are Dick Lawyer, David Moses, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poye and Paul de Ca<0xC3><0xB1>a.
Former coach of Aloe Athletic says he did not feel afraid of such famous names in such a big club, previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now success for me will be the answer to the question, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'"
According to the structure and material base of the club, his place is probably in the Premier League," he said.
"Not only do I want to get him back there, but I will only consider my work successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross has only worked as a coach for three years, before that he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and for 15 months worked at the coaching staff of the Harts.
He then helped Aloe to return from the third league and transformed Saint-Mir<0xC3><0xA8>ne from a loser who almost landed at the Champions League to the winner next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academy.
Recalling the work at Aloa, he said that "It was a really important choice."
“I really believed that coaching is what I need, even more than a game.
Sounds amazing because I've been working well, earning well and reaching certain heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still going through this when it comes to stress and pressure, but coaching is what's needed.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, and for me it's the best time of my adult life."

According to research, the perfect time to drink a pint of beer – 17:30 on Saturday
The hot summer has boosted the profits of British pubs struggling to survive, but has brought pressure on the restaurants' networks.
According to the statistics of the pubs and bars group, sales grew by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants sales fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Advisory Group, which compiled this statistic, said: "Longer sunny weather and longer than expected, the participation of the English team in the final of the World Championships was reported in July, which means that in July, the
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June, only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars, which mainly sell drinks, have yet to show the best result as opposed to restaurants.
Pubs that sell more food are also soaked in the sun, although not as strong as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent, and food sales decreased by three percent.
Paul Neumann, RSM's rest and placement analyst, said: "These results are becoming a trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
It's not surprising that restaurants continue to struggle, as sales have fallen by 4.8 percent per year, and it's very unpleasant when prices are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer has come at the worst time for operators who are focused on food, and time will show whether lower temperatures in August will bring such an expected relief."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those recently opened, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracking tool in British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active groups, which have a total turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an important benchmark in the industry.
One out of every five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The study showed that one in five children – some just turned 11 – have secret social media accounts that hide them from parents and teachers.
Study of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of "fake Insta" pages
This news has fueled fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of pupils said they have a "basic" account that shows parents
One in five children – some just turned 11 – create social media accounts that they keep secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rapid growth of “fake Insta” accounts – which seem to be being shared on Instagram.
This news has fueled fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of the pupils said they keep "clean" "basic" accounts to show to their parents, and also keep private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, learned that she had been called by others to “rape me.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Directors Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of teens aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s very troubling that so many teenagers want to create a place online where neither parents nor teachers will find them.”
Eilid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Council of Athletics
Eileen Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an observer member of the council at the body's annual general meeting.
Doyle – Scotland’s most titular athlete and the mayor of Ian Beatty described this event as a great opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from her experience at a variety of levels, including international in the last decade.
“Elid enjoys great respect in Scotland, the UK and the global sports community, and we are confident that lightweight athletes in Scotland will get a lot of benefit from her work in the council,” said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I want to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope to help manage the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two more gold medals at other Olympics, and who now works as an expert on the BBC, cannot walk after having survived the mini-advisor.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will improve and to what extent.
It was hard work, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and now I'm doing exercise in the gym!

An advertisement for a milk pump, where mothers are compared to cows, shared opinions on the Internet
The dairy pumping company has shared views, releasing an ad that compares lactating women with cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is called the "world's first milk pump" consumer company Elvie released an Iranian music ad based on a video to show the freedom this device gives to a nursing mother.
Four real mothers dance in a cage with cows under the song, where the words are: "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you didn't notice, it's not a faggot, it's my chest."
And he said, "I feed the children, I give to my wives, I give to my children."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a heated debate on the internet.
77 000 views and hundreds of comments. The reaction to the video was ambiguous, many said it was a horror of dairy production.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to give birth, only their children are taken away in a few days," one viewer wrote.
Elvie's baby pump is invisibly hiding in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “Obviously traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for a mother who does not have children?"
Someone added, "Such a reckless advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman wrote that she considered the song "forgotten".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have one if I had breastfeeding.
The smell of the milk makes me feel like I'm pregnant.
It's a bit crazy, but I liked it.
“It’s a brilliant product,” she wrote.
Another comment: "A very entertaining advertisement directed at the mother, who sucks milk with a pump (often at work or in the toilet) and hear themselves "cars".
“This is not an endorsement or condemnation of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all danced with invisible milk pumps hidden in bras.
The concept of an advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use breast pumps feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires, no tubes and invisibly hides in the bra for nursing women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to hold children and even leave the house while the device is working.
Ana Ballarin, partner and creative director of Mother, said: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
By running a parallel between breastfeeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to the suction of milk and its difficulty, while demonstrating in a fun and gentle way how a new milk pump will bring extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time Elvis has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on a podium dressed by Martha Yakubovski, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are transported to a tent camp on the border of Texas without excessive noise
Although the number of border crossings per month has hardly changed, the number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies pursued by the Trump administration, which have hampered the placement of children with sponsers.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors are illegal immigrants who are afraid to endanger their own stay in the country, taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased significantly in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of households would need to submit fingerprints and data would be passed on to the immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, spoke before Congress with a report on the arrests of dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later reported that 70% of those arrested had not previously had a conviction.
"About 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a significant part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That is why we continue to persecute such people,” Mr. Albens said.
To speed up the treatment of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, and, according to shelter workers, the earlier standard term was 60 days.
A large number of people will have to use the video link to apply for their own legal status to an immigration judge, rather than be present in court in person.
Those who don't have the resources to help will be expelled soon.
According to shelter workers and reports from sources in the system, which have appeared in recent months, the longer children remain in captivity, the higher the likelihood of depression or an increase in anxiety, which can lead to explosions.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions such as Tarnilla, these problems are much more pronounced, as signs that the child is in a good condition are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to a tent town without providing time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many have already faced.
Syria calls for the immediate withdrawal of “occupation forces” from the United States, France and Turkey
In a call to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the war that has been going on in the country for eight years.
Mualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, based on the fight against terrorism, and "they will be treated accordingly."
"They should leave immediately and without any conditions," he said at the Assembly's meeting.
Mualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of people have had to leave their homes, "the war on terrorism is almost over."
He said Damascus intends to “continue this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mostly serving as instructors and advisers to the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's land-based contingent in this war-torn country is more than 1,000 soldiers.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions for return were favorable and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that detain refugees abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their return,” he said.
“They’re politicizing an exceptionally humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be assisted in its recovery until a political agreement on the end of the war has been reached between Assad and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the latest major insurgency-backed Idlib has created an opportunity for political negotiations to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian forces into the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "precise terms" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, who "will be destroyed."
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and opposition, in the near future to draft a subsequent constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem expressed the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and cautioning against interference.
Why Trump's Going to the Next Level
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election if, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal do not end his presidency.
And this, without a doubt, will be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in all history!”
At the moment, there is no sign of tiredness.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled – to 1.05 million on CNN and almost three times – to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" channel MSNBC gathered at the screen broadcasting 3.5 million viewers and exceeded the ratings of cable.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because we don’t understand it,” says Neil Beer, director of ABC’s Pereemnik drama about a member of the Cabinet who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nelly Scowell, a fictional comedian and author of the book "A Couple of Funny Details and a Few Tough Truths About Entering the Club of Hollywood Boys," there is another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The president told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He said, "Because he's entertaining me," Miss Scowell told me.
Chaos is also valuable to those who can be comforted.
Of course, unlike all the rest of television, the storylines that come out of Washington can be as defining a future as the case of "Row vs. Wade," depending on whether the immigrants' families will be able to.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, if you watch for the sixth hour, as a group of experts discusses the use of Bob Woodward's "information is not for printing" in the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 in leather (clothing, quilted jackets)
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way I did before.
“A part of what he does makes you feel like you’re watching a reality show he’s showing every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and co-creator of Pawn Stars.
You can't afford to miss even one episode, otherwise you'll get away from the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Flesh this week, outside the windows of his house on the north coast of Kauai stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees of heat, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC until he recorded CNN.
He could not resist, not when Brett Cowan stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which hung on its head.
"I remember the days when we were releasing these crazy shows and people were like, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Flesh told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Foreign money flows are poured into the stiff pre-election race of the midterm elections in the House of Representatives
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th constituency has been hit by a cash flood due to a change in the boundaries of the districts introduced by Congress, which is why two candidates participate in the election for one seat.
The recently redesigned suburban area of Pittsburgh surrounds a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in last spring's elections.
Lambo is opposed by another acting MP, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the votes of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted in favor of the Republicans.
The election race in the new 17th district caused a decline in the company's funding by the financial groups of the main parties, the Congress Committee of the Democratic Company (CDC) and the National Committee of the Republican Company (NCC).
Lamb came to prominence in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in a widely acclaimed election in Pennsylvania's 18th district in March.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point lead.
Politicians are noticing a slight advantage for the Democrats.
The U.S. appreciated the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already backed Beijing's position, despite slight opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted Mr. Trump's leadership team.
Representatives of the State Department decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with the "recent decisions on the non-recognition of Taiwan," the press office said.
However, the sanctions were only considered in relation to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would be painful for the Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings were completed, representatives of North and Central America postponed the holding of a high-level conference devoted to security and economic prosperity, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting held in both the United States and the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials will continue to understand that they want the conference to take place and effectively halt consideration of the issue of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at a conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration is in favour of holding the event.
And the three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debates, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by another, close-to-administration analyst, who also wished to remain anonymous.
Let's learn history
The next step could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on a possible impediment to justice for Mr. Trump, examples of which there is currently very hard evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller drew attention in the investigation to the possibility of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia in the run-up to the election.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will face responsibility before this body, just as he is preparing to speak again before the electorate, and possibly ultimately before the jury, among his peers.
There are many “whens” and I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, just like he is in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make a choice that determines how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the coming years of bloodshed.
History revolves around such moments of change, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or postponed.
Right now, the U.S. is facing some of these critical moments.
What will happen if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the newspaper wrote about the fact that last year he offered to secretly write down the words of the president and considered his proficiency.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the story of The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the recently-requested FBI investigation into Brett Cowan's case is not comprehensive or just, or if it is approved by the Supreme Court, despite the credible allegations of sexual assault and inconclusive?"
And, first of all, are we going to vote for Congress, which will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I don't think we will fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light the Candlesticks on this table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorance of the Rangers is optimistic about the game ahead of "Rapid Vienna"
The Rangers will host "Rapid Vienna" on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain over "Villarreal" earlier this month will allow them to confidently exit Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from performing for the first time in the season to a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, however, he believes the Rangers could take advantage of this result as a springboard.
"It was a significant match for us, because Villarreal is a strong rival," the 31-year-old said.
"We started the game thinking we could get something, and we earned a point.
In the end, we could have shot the ball, but in general, none was a good result as well.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second we took ourselves in hand, and we had a better half of the field.
On Thursday there will be another important night for European football.
I hope we can earn three points, but it will be a difficult game, as they showed a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of fans on the stands, I'm sure we will be able to beat them and show a good game.
"Last year was determined to be difficult, both because of my injuries and the change in the club itself, but now we have a confidence factor.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy the game; the training is productive.
I hope that we can move forward, surpass the result of last season and achieve success."
Women lose their sleep due to fears of retiring.
Despite the fact that the respondents had an accurate idea of what they wanted to care for themselves, few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half of the people who took part in the nationwide study reported talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to discuss it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's what it's worth to start with.
Discuss this with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with a counselor and family and discuss where and how to get medical help, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Get in touch with a financial advisor. He can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these costs, or you can insure your own life in that.
Resolve cases with legal documents: foresee court battles.
Gain confidence in medical care to appoint a trustee to supervise your medical care and ensure that your wishes are met by specialists in the event that you are unable to talk.
In addition, consider the possibility of issuing trust in the management of finances.
Assign a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure that your bills are paid when you are insolvent.
Do not forget about the details: imagine that your elderly father needs immediate medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about allergies and allergies?
Write down these details in writing to make sure you're ready.
“Not only the financial issues but also the professionalism of doctors play a role,” Martin adds.
“What kind of medicine is needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to plan everything.”
In Ilfrakomba, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man got a few hits from a pneumatic rifle when he went home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
Police officials described the shooting, which took place at approximately 2:30 a.m. local time, as an "accidental incident".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, the police are asking witnesses to contact them.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people have been killed as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Paula on Friday, and the number of people killed is expected to be as high.
Due to the disconnection of communication, officials involved in humanitarian aid were unable to obtain any information from the regency of Dongala, a district north of Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paul and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 for 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that extends along more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline on the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
Regency is the administrative unit with the status below the province, in 2017 there were 299,200 people.
Fishing and farming are the economic base of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moraval, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Mitigation, Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by the tsunami in Dongala and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic-active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly rocked by earthquakes.
Below is a list of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Achekh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in the entire coastline of the Indian Ocean, killing 22,000 people.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes erupted on the western coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 points occurred on one of the islands of Mentava outside Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the regency of Podza Jai in Achekh province, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of devastation as a result of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not come, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia's Lambok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence in the family
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin from Vasily, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicted reports of domestic violence and opposition to the arrest, published on Saturday by the state police.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to the channel "KTUU", Palin is in the custody of the insulator Matanuska-Susitna under a deposit of 500 dollars.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "exactly innocent" when asked if he would plead guilty, the network reports.
Palin is accused of three Class A offences, for which he is threatened with imprisonment for a term of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B crime, punishable by imprisonment for a day and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time that charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to tell them about the alleged attack.
The case is currently under review by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, falsifying a report on domestic violence and keeping a weapon in a state of alcoholic intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 for her son's harsh behaviors with post-traumatic syndrome caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake with a force of 7.5 points caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is located in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Video clips have been posted on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
The U.S. Attorney's Office is demanding a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist in New York.
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare punishment that was not used in the state for 19-year-old crimes.
Saipov, 30, in October allegedly took advantage of the leased truck of the company "Home Depot" to ride on a bike path along the West Side chassis in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death sentence, according to the announcement of the intention to achieve the death penalty, handed down in the South District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Sipov "intentionally" beat eight people and "intentionally".
According to the court materials, for both offences, a possible measure of punishment in the form of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal investigative jury of Ashlamil Saipov filed charges against him of 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder in support of the racket; this count is usually used by the federal prosecutors.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "old-fashioned and deliberate planning", and describing the crimes committed by Saipov, used such phrases as "abominable, harsh and dishonest".
"Saifula Habibulaevich Saipov caused injury, caused damage and caused losses to Erika's family and friends Diy Enrique Angelina, Nikolas Kleves, Ana-Lora Dekadt, Darena Drake, Ariel Erlia,
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina, according to the report.
It's been ten years since the last criminal case in New York's South District was launched, with the death penalty being imposed.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal death penalty in New York City was imposed in 1953 before Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were sentenced after they had been convicted two years earlier of conspiring with the purpose of espionage.
The Rosenbergs were sentenced to an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipau, a Uzbek national, has demonstrated, according to court documents, the absence of grievances in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he was pleased with his action.
According to the accused's detention, Saipov informed the authorities that he was inspired by the attack by a videotape of the Islamic State on the phone.
He also asked for permission to hang the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital's palace, police said.
He does not plead guilty to an indictment consisting of 22 counts.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipava, said they were "unconditionally disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to use the death penalty, rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the pain of these events for all participants,” Patan said.
In the past, the Department of Homeland Security has asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Today, during a protest at the Tory Party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the People's Army."
Ukip’s former leader said politicians should “feel discomfort” from Eurosceptics – as one member of parliament, Theresa May, offered her candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bowen said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would have "exited" if Mr Farage had held the post of Brexit secretary.
But the problem Mrs. May faced while trying to reconcile her disparate supporters was exacerbated when the Tories, who advocate EU membership, staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying hard to keep the compromise checker agreement under constant pressure from supporters and opponents of the exit, as well as the EU itself.
The Allies insist on attempts to enter into a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the "disembarkation".
Mr. Bone said at a rally in Salichal, "Leave Means Leave," that he wanted to "throw Checker off the board."
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made equal and that obligations should be placed on negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellington added, "I am for Brexit, but we need to get out of the Checker Plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bowen rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is not entirely in line with reality."
Andrea Jenkins, a supporter of Brexit and a member of the Torah, was also on the march, and in a conversation with reporters, said: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The checkered plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and the activists who are actually going out and electing us.
Please give up the plan and start listening.”
In a sharp appeal to Ms May, she added: "The prime ministers remain in office when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said it was necessary to make politicians "feel uncomfortable" when they are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us – the people and the politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘This is not going to get out of your hands.’”
In his appeal to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make those of our politicians who are ready to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
“We will mobilize the people’s army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit, and we will never settle down until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A number of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adanis resented the Conservatives over the security issues they faced due to the party's schedule at the opening of the conference.
“These are people who tell us that they can have a ready-to-use IT system and all the technology for Canada plus, for a border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the bidding process for the post of President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will "pay close attention to the process of running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about his future during a general assembly in the western part of the state of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is about to run for re-election, opposed by Republican Party member Jeff Dzil, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of discussions as a possible rival of Trump in 2020.
Since Trump's inauguration, it has been his 36th meeting with voters in the format of a general assembly held Saturday in Halioke.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix the broken government, and for that, a woman should be at the forefront."
The arrest came after the death of basketball player Sims from the team of the University of Louisiana
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder of basketball player Wade Sims entered on Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dean Simpson during a press conference that took place at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking to help identify the man who was figuring on it.
The 20-year-old was shot dead on Friday morning near the campus of the University of the South.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head as a result of which he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not object to the arrest and was taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A 6-foot, 6-inch (201 cm) junior athlete who grew up in Baton Rouge, the Sims last season played in 32 games, of which 10 were on the pitch from the start, an average of 2 runs in the undercourt, and 5,4 minutes in the undercourt.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton has come close to the title of world champion after having won by intra-team agreement over Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Fetel
From the moment that Walter Bottas warned ahead of Lewis Hamilton's qualifying race on Saturday, it became clear that the orders within the Mercedes team play a significant role in the race.
Botos drew a good place on the savages and almost left Hamilton to his fate, until he defended his place in the first two guises and invited Fethel to attack his friend on command.
Vettel was the first to go to the pit stop and left Hamilton to wrestle at the end of the overall mass of the racers, it was this maneuver that had to become decisive.
The pilot "Mercedes" went to the pit stop for a lap later and left behind the hotel, but Hamilton went ahead after several round-the-clock maneuvers that forced the driver of the "Ferrari" to leave the interior space.
Max Ferstappen on his 21st birthday started from the back row of the grid and by the end of the first round was in seventh place.
He then led most of the race while the tyres were held, as he wanted to finish quickly, beat Kimi Rikanen and take fourth place.
As a result, he went to the pit stop on lap 44, but was unable to increase the speed on the remaining eight laps, so Rykanen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day, because Walter has been performing fantastically all weekend and has been a true gentleman if I'm allowed to say so.
“The team has done an outstanding job to take first and second place,” Hamilton commented.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she was not the source of Christina Blaise Ford's leaked letter, in which she accused a candidate in the Supreme Court.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not turn directly to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate has shown how people can be "poor, dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see evil, ugly, and lying people," he said.
"When you read about press releases and leaks, then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diana Finstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document – “oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, no.
There was nothing for me.”
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
“No, we didn’t,” he added, urging the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter in July detailing the allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and he fled in early September – but Feinstein denied that an escape had occurred from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t let her story escape,” Finstein told the committee.
“She asked for the story to be kept confidential and I met her request.”
But her refusal probably did not please the president, who commented on this during Saturday's rally: "That's what I'm going to tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend a candidate in the Supreme Court accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president speculated that Democrats are using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return to power by any means necessary.
You see the arrogance, the hate, and they don’t care who they hurt, through whom they have to move to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars – Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer has scored two goals for the Giants in a match against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars played for their loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday as part of the Elite League, winning a 5-3 back-to-back match in their home games on Saturday.
Thanks to the blow of Patrick Dwayer and Francis Bavile Giants led on two discs in the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney equalized the number before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bushard of Dundee equalized the number, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the team with two goals to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time in the season; in the previous three games, they won the Giants.
The first goal in the fourth minute of the match (03:35) was scored by Dwyer with Kendall McFollow, and four minutes later Bavillier doubled the number after David Rutherford.
In the lively first period (13:10), Sullivan opened the number from the field's owners, and then Coon equalized the number after Matt Markward's handover (15:16).
Dwyer provided Giants with the lead on the first break, hitting his second washer at the end of the first period.
Taking the side regrouped, and Bushar again equalized the score, hitting the washer at the team's numerical advantage (27:37).
Coon and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the win along with the team's fifth number in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, will play their last home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies after saving hundreds of passengers from an earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia heroically died, ensuring a successful take-off of the plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared without warning after a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday caused by the tsunami.
Strong underground shocks are still ongoing, and many people are buried under the debris in the city of Paul.
Although his colleagues were on the run, 21-year-old Antonios Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the dispatcher's tower, which was hovering wildly at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Juffri airport.
It remained in place until the Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway at the time, crashed off the ground.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided that it was going to be destroyed.
He later died in the hospital.
According to the Australian program ABC News, according to the representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Johanes Sirajta, the decision of the dispatcher may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was supposed to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning, before the helicopter arrived at Paul's.
“Our hearts are broken,” he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities are worried that the number of victims could reach several thousand, and the agency for the reduction of the danger of natural disasters claims that access to the city of Donghae, Sihi and Bhutan is limited.
A spokesman for the Sutopa Purva Nugroha news agency said: “It is likely that the number of victims will continue to increase, as many bodies have still not been able to recover from the debris.”
The waves, which reached six meters, devastated Paul, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing humanitarian aid to the country's armed forces.
Rissa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the car is bringing bodies.
There is no clean water.
There are shops all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who have survived, but we do not know what awaits them here.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Jok Vidoda arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” asked CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia had already suffered from the earthquakes in Lambokee, which killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: according to the "Air Niugini" one person disappeared without warning after the plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight, which made an emergency landing in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, previously claimed that all 47 passengers and the team were happily evacuated from the plane, which sank, and now is disappearing.
The company "Air Niugini" said in a press release that as of Saturday, it can not report on the location of one passenger-man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately disclose details about the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
The local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and the crew after the plane landed on the water while trying to land at the airport of the island of Chowk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been rushed to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were left in the hospital on Saturday; all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unresolved.
According to both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon, without reaching the landing strip.
According to some witnesses, the plane had jumped over the landing strip.
According to U.S. passenger Bill Janes, the plane was flying very low.
"It's very successful," said Janes.
According to him, he and others were able to walk along the belt in the water to the emergency exits of the plane, which had already sunk.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, as well as that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that the sailors who manned the nearby pier also helped rescue by using an inflated boat to transport people to shore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of registered aircraft in Papua New Guinea in the last twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
An analyst retraces the course of events in the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the indictment completed the submission of evidence in a review of the case of a man accused of incinerating a resident of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, has spent several hours giving indications as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone recordings to retrace the movements of 29-year-old respondent Quinton Taylor and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, according to Roulett, he received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Taylor was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his previous statement.
When the data that his mobile phone was next to Chambers's phone at the time, according to him, he was confirmed along with his friend Michael Senford, the police were on their way to ask Senford.
Sandford testified on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by the prosecution whether Talis was telling the truth that Sanford was in the van that night, he said he was "lieing since my van was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was Talis's assertion that he was familiar with Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The cell phone records showed that they had known each other for about a week.
According to Rowlett, some time after her death, Chambers Talis deleted her messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Haley said.
The defense side should begin the disputes of the sides on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be referred to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio intends to challenge the negative view of this genre, filling their music with positive installations.
The High Breed, a group from Britain, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins: political statements and interpersonal issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Akala and Lowkey have returned to the likes of The Fugees and Common, popular in the UK.
There's another black hole?!
New York babysitter sues a married couple for a "racist" message after the dismissal
A New York babysitter sues a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a random message from a mother complaining that she is "another black woman".
The couple denies that they are racists, equating the demand for "competition".
In 2016, Linsey Plasca-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment at discovering that the new babysitter, Jessie Morris, was black when she arrived on her first working day.
"NEEEEEEEE, I'M A ONE BLACK Skull," Mrs. Plaska-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending his husband, she twice sent a message to Miss Morris.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the error, Plasca-Flaxman "fell indifferent" and fired Miss Morris, claiming that the former babysitter, who was also an African American, was not doing well at work, and that she was waiting for her Finley instead.
Miss Morris paid for the day's work and sent home on Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple and wants to get compensation for her dismissal under the terms on which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract: $350 a day for six months with a residency.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," she told the Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple overturned the accusations of racism, claiming that the dismissal of Morris was a sensible decision, given that they could not trust her after she had been insulted.
"My wife sent her something she shouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Post's husband, Joel Plaska, said.
“Would you trust your children to whom you dealt with rudely, even accidentally?
Your baby's?
Is it not?”
Plaska equates the demand for "competition" and reports that his wife was born only two months ago and was in "a very difficult situation".
“And you’re going to persecute a man in that position?
It’s pretty tough,” – added the specialist on investment-banking activity.
Although litigation is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, subjecting them to sharp criticism of their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers have warned that readers will not outsmart the talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was adopted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of the one who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It is so interesting to read, already aware of the great success of Paddington."
She said her father, who worked as a BBC operator before he dared to write a book for children about a little teddy bear, was optimistic despite his work not being accepted and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a "proud one."
She added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success, speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family."
“He was quite a quiet man, and not at all boastful,” she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost a parental honor for a child to achieve something: you're proud of them, even though it's not really your merit.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave what belonged to Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to develop with her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors fought for her life in vain.
“I’ve been calling over regularly to say that it’s really bad, that she can’t stand it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then Nad phoned me to tell her that she would die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, “I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that doctors gave her to be afraid of her heart, slowly left her body.
She died some time ago, and that was the end.
I just had to sit there, knowing that everything was unfolding there.
I couldn't stop crying, crying, crying, because there were families and people around me.
I had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Edna-Laperuz, who was experiencing the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers – and they did not know at all what she had to go through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I shook my head and my face was full of tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a sense of sympathy for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women who are grieving hang out cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones, who have committed suicide, do everything in their power to ensure that other people do not take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang cards on a bridge in Wales with warm words and phone numbers that people can get help on.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began depression, and at the age of 18 he ended his life by suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the way I do,” she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a talented chef with an infectious smile.
“Everybody knew his smile.
People said that his smile would light up any room."
However, before his death, he quit work because he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says: “I’m constantly worried that this could have unpleasant consequences.”
Ms. Davis created the cards, "so that people know that there are people in the world that you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t be shy, you need to talk.”
Ms. Hasfres, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was sad, or that he was depressed, or anything like that," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the holy day he was very depressed: when the children opened the gifts, he did not even look at them.
She said that his death was a big injury for them, but she had to live with it: "There was a big hole in the family.
It's just killing us.
But we have to keep fighting and fighting.”

Brett Cowano's future is uncertain as the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought we could have what he wanted - limited in time and in scope of investigation - we could get a little bit of a reunion," Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was "dissolving" because of what was actually tragic.
"Why do Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance is sometimes explained.
Interim elections in just five weeks, November 6 – if Republicans are expected to suffer a defeat, then they will be weakened in their attempts to choose the Supreme Court candidate they need.
George W. Bush called the senator to work out the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush's presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who then worked as Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cowano will receive at least 50 votes in a Senate vote, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of vote equality and approve it in the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea has declined under Kim's leadership.
The number of migrants from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said in a statement.
Pak Bo-sung, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year and 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that the main reasons are strengthened border control between North Korea and China and higher funds set up by smugglers for the reshipment.
Pyongyang has not commented on this.
Most of the refugees from the north, in turn, get the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, with North Korea having the longest border. It is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very heavily guarded.
China sees migrants as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still in a state of war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when they agreed on common terms to work with the goal of completely liberating the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Rui Yang Ho, accused the U.S. of sanctions in the absence of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such conditions we are not going to be the first to disarm,” Mr. Rye said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Covano "hysterical", she says he should not work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate in the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano "hysterical" and said that in his temperament he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune publishing festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t get rid of the thought that if a woman behaved like that, she would be called a ‘hysteric’,” Pelosi told the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s speech.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied accusations of sexual misconduct to Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and unable to speak when his family and the senior classes of the school were discussed.
He also explicitly blamed the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him a "great and organized murder of a person" organized by liberals who were outraged by the fact that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Covano's speech showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he clearly showed that he had a bias against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try Cavanaugh's impeachment if he was elected and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he's not just not supposed to work in the Supreme Court, he's also supposed to work in the court where he works now," Pelosi said.
At the moment, Kavanaugh is a judge of the District Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she is concerned about Cowano's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or in the case of Rowe against Wade, as Cowano is considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearings in the post, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings.
"Now is not the time for hysterical, non-objective individuals to work in court and expect words from us "how wonderful it is," said Pelosi.
A woman should be able to do that.
It's a justified indictment, months and years of anger just spills over, and she can't remember it without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Stein told me 45 years ago.
“I don’t think it’s that rare.”
She continued: "I was very helped by a woman who worked as a director somewhere, and who said that when she got angry, she was crying, but she was developing a behavioral technique. When she got angry and started crying, she said to me, 'I'm sorry, I can't.
But I'm angry."
I just continued the conversation.
I think it was great.”
Tears are allowed in part as a way out of the amount, because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of my first work, in which I once wept with indescribable anger, then I was grabbed by an old woman behind the collar – a restrained boss who always scared me a little bit – and dragged me to the sunset.
"Never let yourself be seen in tears," she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they brought you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman-democrat from the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt got married on a yacht called Monkey Business and left the presidential race, a very angry Mrs. Schroeder believed that she could participate in the presidential campaign herself.
“It wasn’t a very well thought out decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates already, and I didn’t need them at all.
Someone called this situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the company has been going for quite a long time, it did not have enough funds, so she said she would not take part in the elections if she did not raise 2 million dollars.
It was a losing situation.
It turned out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm going with a discount?" she thought.
When she made a statement that she would not participate in the election campaign, she was so strongly embraced by emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, anger at the system, which made it so difficult to get money and directed at the voters.
"You might think I have a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Shrodar's reaction to the press on her condition.
“You might have thought that my corporate sponsor is a Kleenex paper towel manufacturer.
I used to think they were going to write on my headstones.

Why a trade war between China and the United States could be good for Beijing
The first rounds of the trade war between China and the United States have been tumultuous, and since the war is far from over, misunderstandings between countries in the more distant perspective may be in Beijing's favor, experts say.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing China's main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation occurred this week as new tariffs hit goods totaling $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing responded in the same way, recently raising tariffs from five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised the United States a symmetrical response, and the second-largest economy is unlikely to succeed.
In order to force Washington to back down, we need to delve deeper into the demand, but public inclination towards the US is almost unacceptable for Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the U.S. trade war pressure in the long run could support China by reducing the mutual dependence of the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start the process of a sharp economic downturn is much more dangerous than the observers previously thought," said Abigail Grace, assistant director of the U.S. Department of Defense.
Syria "ready" for the return of refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to return to normal life.
We now have all the conditions for returning refugees to a country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and targeted economic measures aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid for the reconstruction of a devastated country.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from countries that sponsored the militants.
Europe wins the Copa del Rey in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider's Cup, defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil and has not won the Ridder's Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe was crowned when the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who fought the most in the tournament, pushed his ball into the water on 3 pairs of the 16th hole, conceding this match to Francesco Malinara.
The Italian golfer Molinari played excellently in all rounds, becoming one of four players to have passed this field with a 5-0-0 score since the start of the tuning in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spears was knocked out with 5 and 4 players with the lowest ranking in the European team, Thornbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olsen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter of England, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ridder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a has become the player who has the most wins in the tournament with a career number of 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t hold back today.
It's been a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to get the cup back.
It’s all about the team, and I’m glad I could help,” said the shocked Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He handed over the relay to his fellow countryman John Ram, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in singles 2&1 matches.
“I’m very proud to have won Tiger Woods, the man I’ve watched since I was a kid,” said 23-year-old Rum.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record number of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A staggering statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and lags behind only Jack Niklaus.
The American team competed against each other with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tani Finn, who played during the entire high-class golf tournament.
American captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game in defense of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighters.
This morning, we showed Europe what we are capable of.
We fought.
We'll take off our hats in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the American Golf Association and our Ridder's Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We've been run over."
