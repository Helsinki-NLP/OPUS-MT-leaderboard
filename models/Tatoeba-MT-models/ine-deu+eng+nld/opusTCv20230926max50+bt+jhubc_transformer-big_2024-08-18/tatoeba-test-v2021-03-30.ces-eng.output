I don't know why I'm bothering anymore.
I'm not as powerful as I used to be.
Tom's dog bit a few chickens.
Don't forget that Tom is blind.
Mary was dreaming about getting married.
No disputation against taste.
When Tom returned home in the evening, he found that there was no dinner left for him.
He knows them.
I'm sure they're very proud of their daughter.
Tom turned to the right and Mary went to the other side.
There's one left.
He began to explain what had happened.
Tom has an iron stomach, he can eat almost anything.
The mother did not know what to do with her son.
He knows wine.
Tom could feel someone knocking on his shoulder.
Do you know who their parents are?
No words will tell you how wonderful you are.
I'd like some fruit juice.
Will it rain tomorrow?
The wedge font invented by the Sumerians was used in many languages in the ancient Middle East.

You've found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
Before eating, she washed her dirty hands.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left a high spout on the table.
It's not over a glass of beer after a full day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
So far I am satisfied with my work.
Do you really need help?
To be you, I'll ask him.
Leave them to us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting even though I was invited.
Hey, are you still here?
I thought you were probably dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
The dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you've paid a lot for your car.
Tom's obviously lying.
Straight and then to the right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'm gonna have to talk to you again.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's gonna be 13 the next day.

I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you do.
We climbed to the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember how she was?
That belt's too tight for me.
Playing the bassoon is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer here.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are rapidly dying out today.
Tom still has a lot of work to do.
You'd better get out of here now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I'm sorry to bother you, I'm just here to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What was Tom yelling at the crowd?
He is the ideal husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in seventeenth-century costumes.
Are you satisfied with your body?

He climbed the tree with great effort.
Translating Czech text is very difficult.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was there too.
That's all we know, Tom.
I'm glad you brought that to my attention.

You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for the job.

Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.

We didn't do as well as we'd like.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you and Joana have a fight?

The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered with black clouds.
I need it more than you do.

I'm afraid I'm gonna be stuck here forever.
Tom put on the enema.
What should I do in this situation?
Are you going to school by train?
Tom's not going to school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who will Tom visit?
It's Tom's fault, not Mary's.
Why don't you invite me for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I wouldn't be surprised if it happened.
He's free.
That's not what people normally say.
Ask your mother.
Tom carefully washed his feet.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was as happy as a flea when she got a recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time at his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you'd helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's going to visit his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in a place like this?

I'm completely happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we are still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
There was a half-broken wall here.
I spoke to him in English and found that I could make a deal.
Tom had to run.
I see a book.

You should apologise.
The fence is freshly painted.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're fat.
We're supposed to win.
All answers must be written according to instructions.
Answer me the questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and didn't come back.
Did you bring the book?
I dare not open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting a divorce.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
Who are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything bad about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a burst of laughter.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
It's better to be dead than red to live.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he's saying.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse squealed.
I borrowed Tom's comb.

I'm so glad you're here.
She's soft.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.

Throw the balloon at Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Were the police involved?’
We like kids.
