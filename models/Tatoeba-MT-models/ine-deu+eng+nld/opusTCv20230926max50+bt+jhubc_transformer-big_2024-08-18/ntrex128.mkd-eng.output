Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they “look like maps”
Some Members of the Assembly are astounded at the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be the subject of ridicule.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that it was "rhyming with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Welsh: Welsh twp means "stupid/crazy" and pwp means "how".
A member of Plaid said the party as a whole was "not happy" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said his party was "free-minded" about the name change, but noted that the similarity between the words MWP and "mappet" is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision on which words to name the members of the assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on proposals that indicated strong support for the appointment of the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
For the question of the name of the Members of the Assembly, the committee prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from public consultations.
MEPs are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could cause headaches for House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to file a draft law on the changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will give the final vote on the question of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was set up in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are ringing as churches in Harlem face problems
“Historically, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
“There is no one or the other today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People are socializing in a different way today,” he said.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods where people go regularly.
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the properties will not last as long as the leaders think, “and sooner or later, they will return to the same place from which they started.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced with residential buildings full of type of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the settlement.
“Most of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white,” he said, “and that’s why it’s going to accelerate the day when these churches close completely because it’s unlikely that most of the people who live in those apartments will become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by congregations of whites before Harlem became a metropolis of blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original Congregation of Methodist Whites relocated in the 1930s.
The Congregation of Negroes who practice their faith nearby takes ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Congregation of Negroes during the reign of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of vendors on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or advance Negroes.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but because members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bell of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it different: "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part brought by the church’s unprofessional leaders, and part of the episcopal diocese.
The ecclesiastical board – the church’s governing body, composed of incompetent leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would “request to pass on its costs” to the ecclesiastical board, although the ecclesiastical board was not involved in the employment of the archbishops.
Some members of the parish complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Child During Cushion Diving in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California, on the opening day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB television in San Diego that he dived with his friends around an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and then rowed to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel stated that at first he thought it was a thrill to catch a lobster, but then "I realized he was shouting, 'I'm late!
I was too late!”
The whole key bone was looking at him," Hamel said he noticed after reaching the boy.
“I called out to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hamel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was treated as in a critical condition.
It is not known from which species the shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gilles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but they decided the shark was not of a dangerous species.
Gilles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed the beach from the Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Gilles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquired Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of department stores full of professional helpers.
As part of the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn substantial entry into the UK beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and household sales decline, large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country year-over-year.
The investment in beauty emerged after supermarkets began looking for ways to use the space on the shelves that was once intended for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup series, making most of the products suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume merchant Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Creeddon, South London, last week, and the second opened in Selli Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cooper, the director of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off Aldi and Lidl discounts with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's began putting Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they said increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after disagreement over how to split profits from chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a must-have beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their brand Truly for household products and accessories.
The couple's business is related to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This 37-year-old morning program manager said on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, withdrawing from their lucrative branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when the television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her brand-new products - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - don't mean they're worth it.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was said to double Willoughby’s wealth estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby said on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left the UK in one of his cottages.
A source said: “Truly has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was meant to be her long-term future that will follow her in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all concerned caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
At Marlow’s headquarters, there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe the departure of this morning’s program leader, one of Britain’s highest-paid stars, could cost the firm millions because of large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household products and the potential for further postponement.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as president in March.
The couple go on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand's ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We don’t comment on his business feats.”
“Serious conversation” and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for commenting on what some would consider "non-presidential" and because he is so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said in a statement that he was "reformed as a news anchor".
“I didn’t give up on anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump rated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North sees no "appropriate response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
“We agree very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have such a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: missile tests had ended, hostages had been freed, and the remaining U.S. troops had returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach in the conversation about relations with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we’re going to have 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and claimed hundreds of lives
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, no elemental disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge,” Mr. Sumbung said.
Although “Save the Children” is a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Due to the earthquakes that are constantly hitting Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on the other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning has been issued, has likely contributed to the loss of life.
At its best, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Vidodo’s election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia’s old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko’s administration in the run-up to the re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starridge of the Liverpool team equalised against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to Starridge at about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1–0.
He shifted the ball to the left before pointing it towards the far stand.
The ball moved high above the sixteenth as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the jumping cap Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get in that position, get to the ball, and players like Shak always serve as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible,” he told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching and I just touched her and I didn’t think much about it and I was just shooting.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The blues striker pitched a fifth back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before kicking the ball almost halfway through the pitch, and then sprinted to halfway through Liverpool.
They rushed to Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in the middle of the field.
He then fired a missile, leading Hazard to the Sixteenth.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up in the net on the long-distance stand with a left-footed shot alongside Alison Becker at Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said earlier this week.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves at a height of 20 feet, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was crippled by gunfire from demolished buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Mercyside.
The forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stabbing wounds on Grayson Mows on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard something to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the cameras from the cars to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.”
Police say the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the facility.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as the police said, they will inform the victims’ loved ones.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Moves just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that he was not allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have now been told that it will take hours before they can return home.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, covered in tears.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were at the border, and another was outside.
A number of police officers were standing at the border watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters on 0800 555 111 citing record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament became the latest memorial in the "rewrite of history" controversy
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "insanity" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate about removing statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclast of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Sir William Hammott's wonderful presentation of Cromwell is proof of 19th-century thinking and part of the historiography of a figure many still believe to be worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
Swine Killer Scattered and Killed Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Juan", was found dead with a skin artery lined with blood near a bone at a market in Liupanshui in Gizhou province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xingning, Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and opened an open door from the neighboring pork coop.
He said there was a large squirrel of blood on the mud in the sledgehammer.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound squirrel tore the farmer apart and killed him, according to the report.
“My cousin’s leg was bloody and broken,” said the cousin, given the surname Wu, according to a quote in Guayang’s evening news.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Juan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of cases of pigs attacking humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig hooked a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife pushed the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs were not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood could act as an “activator.”
“They’re just playing.”
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa Will Bring Heavy Rain to Southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves through the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring floods of rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rose brought 85 mph winds, a Category 1 hurricane from 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to introduce large tropical moisture north-southwest.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture with the depression approaching will create abundant rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden flooding, a flow of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Large tropical moisture will cause precipitation that in some places will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible due to the rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is especially recommended not to walk in the desert in case of tropical rain.
Frequent rains can cause canyons to become turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring locally heavy rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rains of more than half an inch in total are possible, which can cause rivers of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
Periodic tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before the rains spread more late on Monday and Tuesday.
The rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected throughout the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, but tropical areas remain with high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
A great example of a dramatic temperature difference will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is a 20 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to recreate and expand.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures at 80 degrees from the southern plains to the southeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates the possibility of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony Thursday of nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christina Blasy Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the deadlocked political situation continued, with speakers interrupting regular reversal programs at the last minute on Friday: Jeff Fleck, an Arizona senator, made an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh had been drinking and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, stated that he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen reported, watched it on Friday.
The company had average views on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that displayed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people who look in offices.
To better portray it, it is an audience of a size similar to a playoff competition in football or a film academy awards.
The Fox News channel, whose executives strongly attacked Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Fleck was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After the Republican office moderately issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras captured him as protesters on Friday morning as he tried to get into an elevator for the court committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes as they rebuked him, and it was all broadcast live on CNN.
“They’re standing right in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth on earth?”
He was told, “You have power, and so many women are powerless.”
Fleck said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door was closed, that there would be more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks all covered hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Fleck said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider charges against the nominee next week, which was requested by the minority Democrats.
Fleck was convinced in part by his conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Kuns, and several senators thereafter, Fleck made a decision.
Fleck's election was significant because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party's conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview right next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called “Checkers” Brexit plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the “reciprocal treasury”.
Shot at Wade Sims: Police Arrest Suspect Dieton Simson for Death of Louisiana State University Athlete
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
The 20-year-old Dieton Simpson has been arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, a WAFB partner told CBS.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the pathologist of the parish of eastern Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head towards the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police’s Refugee Unit, the State Police’s Forensic Laboratory, Southern University Police, and citizens from the relief area who gave it in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for her "activity in the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6.6-foot pitcher grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 catches per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of Louisiana State University's basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Sims' death.
“This is what you care about all the time,” the coach said.
Volcano dumps ash on Mexico City
The ash discharge from the Popokatepetl volcano has reached the southern settlements of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Sunday not to head for the volcano after activity began in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center followed more tremors and tremors.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City’s settlements, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity on the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 magnitude rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police for public order and peace and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote to secede.
A group of masked supporters of the separatists held by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into the can, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would usually be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fighters also broke out, and police used batons to suppress the fighters.
For more than a few hours, independence groups have been shouting “No forgetting, no forgiveness,” and on the other hand, trade union protesters have been shouting “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media said.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region, a year after Madrid characterized the October 1 referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the exit was small due to the boycott by people who were against the breakup.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
The independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
The sixty-eight-year-old electrician, Narcissus Termes, who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would have a chance of gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to keep up the momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders either in self-elected exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, recording the police support protest, said the conflict was backed by politicians on both sides.
“Everything is getting tough,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in jail ahead of a trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners arrested for stabbing a car in a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly stabbing a car in a house in Londonbury.
The incident took place in Balinagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gate and the building itself.
At some point it is possible to shoot with a shotgun arrow towards the car.
Menga's season brought a 1-0 win to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured a win
Advanced Livingston beat the Rangers by signing Steven Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 games, as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's tenure proved significant as Gary Hold's side rose to one level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's side lost a guest victory in the championship season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind them with eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remain undefeated in the division for six games, and coach Holt has yet to face a defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston misses the chance against the cruel guests
Holt's team had to lead for a long time before they gave the goal, and their directness caused many problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but dragged the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts away after slipping Craig Hulkett's head over the goal.
The guests were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with their actions.
And that’s how the ultimate goal came about.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston received an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson putting together Menga, who scored just one touch from the center of the sixteenth.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball, but could not break through the hosts' defenses, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly for the most part did not play.
That scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was making a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of Rangers goaltender Alan McGregor, and Litgow took the ball away from yet another set action at Livingston.
The Sixteenth of Livingston was constantly passing by and was constantly defended, while two demands for a penalty – after Hulkett’s challenge to Glenn Middleton’s replacement and one for hand play – were rejected.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alastair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were great, continuing to exceed the expectations of this uphill path.
Their playing style and character hardly changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way the team has galvanized since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warall on hold.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they once were under Gerard's leadership, they are now lagging behind by the same standards.
Their last game was weak – they only managed to open the hosts once – and that’s little awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received mixed reception in the Colonies
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have worsened due to problems that included human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to the Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also spoke out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposing protesters portray the visitor's split as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: biker dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bested and Evelyn Streets, a major traffic congestion in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and came to an ambulance, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The collision occurred several months after another cyclist died in a traffic accident on Childers Street where the driver fled, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been put in place and buses have been diverted and it is recommended that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six Police Officers Wounded in Riots
Six prison police officers were injured in unrest at a high-security men's prison, the prison's office said.
The riots erupted at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado unit were brought in to resolve the unrest, which includes eight prisoners and is confined to one wing.
Officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were directed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and may spend additional time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 detainees, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, police for public order and peace were summoned to prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (may be useful for arid areas)
A tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but it’s likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining force will pass through the desert’s southwestern region, posing a risk of abrupt flooding.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, all the way to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Las Vegas.
Rosa is expected to travel a straight path across the Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Weather Station said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have retained the status of a tropical storm or depression within the 200-mile range of the 1950 Phoenix!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The State Hurricane Center’s latest models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches at the edge of Arizona’s Mongolon.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated locations up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are outside the risky areas of sudden flooding, the rain of the Rose can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is affected by drought.
“According to the U.S. drought watchdog, nearly 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second highest category.”
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa led to landslides all over the Lower California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with the intensity of a hurricane on Sunday morning with winds of up to 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and is declining.
Therefore, rains are expected in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected to rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," a weather.com statement said.
Rose will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah until late evening hours on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from the Rose or its remnants is very heavy rains in Lower California, southwest Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States," the State Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening sudden floods and streams of debris, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with puncture wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace at around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are asking if anyone has the cell phone footage of the incident, to step up.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the most stern and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blasy Ford's accusations that he had committed a sexual assault on her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing about her allegations as well.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliance, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to uphold one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the significance of the Republicans' exit from the early elections.
“Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
“I’m not running, but I’m really fighting,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere and I’m fighting for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats had a mission to “resist and prevent.”
The first key vote for Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP chief told CNN.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesian Earthquake and Tsunami and Total Death toll Increases
At least 384 people have died, many driven by huge waves hitting beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves at a height of 6 meters (18 feet) hit the sunset coast, leading many to certain death and destroying everything on their way.
After the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, a tsunami struck.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for BNPB's disaster mediation agency.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, trees, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centres in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, crooked and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Successive tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the energy released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coastline, is likely to increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the shots of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could increase along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communication was "completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are headed to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing us that the tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came around the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur photo shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of a building can be heard shouting insanely, warning people down the street of the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water sticks to the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened only for aid and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala safely arrived in the city of Palu, where employees were sheltered in cerada shelters in the backyard of their office, they were on their way through scenes of desolation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses being destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began grim attempts to begin aiding the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts had been prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international aid, but it still has no status.”
As it fell the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that would lighten the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been stuck under a shot for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's state paragliding team, coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how, when she began circulating news of the demolition of the Roa Roa hotel in the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu contestants, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray tick instead of a son.
“I think that means the messages aren’t delivered,” he said.
The robbers stole $26,750 while charging ATMs at Newport on the Kayo
Thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's employee who supplemented an ATM at Newport on the Quay, according to a press release from Newport police station.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to supplement it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "runned behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Jay
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yay.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "Society formerly known as Kanye West".
Forty-one-year-old West wore the nickname Yay for some time and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show who had to cancel for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
Although he uses it as an abbreviation for his current professional name, West previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'she' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and that's where 'you' means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“What do you mean I’m you, I’m us, that’s us?
He came from Cana, which means the only one, to Yeh, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
“The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, Jay-Z, also uses his name with or without a line and all capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico vows not to use its military against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
The military fired on peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly help to those studying and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its research resources in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Increasing the budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next big achievement in the field of AI will be made by the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (Superpowers in Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published a month ago by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of SinoVentures+, one of the largest companies in the world.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Melon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the highest-ranking American skeleton player, and later was the director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's branch in China.
Lee thanked the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions as a challenge in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s robotics and asked when the next competition would be, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think ‘green cards’ should automatically be offered to science doctors by artificial intelligence,” he said.
The State Council of China issued its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's state-run Natural Sciences Foundation is funding people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organizations are distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should include industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the formation of an Artificial Intelligence Authority Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
As for the NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the creation of a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not been in effect for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its demands for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbor represents entitlement to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The referendum question read: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies like the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Gjorgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout stood at 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjo<0xC5><0xA1>e Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave their vote at the referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on September 30, 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and chairs in front of tents set by people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I believe that the majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said the “yes” result would be “confirmation of our future”.
The poll, published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required output.
A second poll conducted by Macedonian television, Telma, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them will vote yes.
In order for a referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since they came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes Brighton's entire defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly overcame Brighton's defense in a 2–0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield submission at the start of the sequence.
He quickly passed between three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
Aguero was then found surrounded by four "greens".
He circumvented one defensive player before racing several others on the edge of Brighton's sixteenth.
He then turned left of him, to Sterling.
The English striker used his first come to the sixteenth to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right foot beat Brighton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with a single shot to the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly blues" was given by Sterling in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a long ball in Brighton territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful straight ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before taking Sterling to the remote stallion.
The attack of the "Heavenly Blues" brought the ball into the net before it came out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a spoiler against Rocky
Since the Nashvilles were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But the always-competitive Sherzer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for a playoff for the Rockies, who lead with one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies had at least a “joker” for a place with a 5–2 win over the Nashvilles on Friday night, but they are still struggling to secure their place in the first division.
"Although we're not playing for nothing, at least we can throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is probably going to be played at the highest level of any moment I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
The Nashvilles still have to release a starter in a week, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to pitch in such a situation.
Sherzer, who will start after the 34th race, practiced throwing on Thursday and will throw the usual rest on Sunday.
Washington's right is 18–7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout points in 220 2/3 innings per season.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Trump rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation around his election of Brett Cavanaugh to the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of Republicans' exit from the early elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far will be put to the test in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big ones — I’m not running, but I’m really fighting, and that’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump continued, “You see these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power using all the means at their disposal, you see the evil, the ugliness.
They don’t care who they hurt, when they have to run over in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want power and control, but we won’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and impede.”
"And you've seen that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, mean, rude and untrue."
He mentioned Senator Diana Feinstein from the ranks of the Democrats, appointed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, to which the public responded with outcry.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, wait a minute – that was very bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer accepts different opinions.
Those who express their opinions are not tolerated.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last member of parliament from the Labour Party to be told that we are not welcome – just because he expresses his opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment for taking a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement was criticizing me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the Eastern Labour Party of Nottingham stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party’s parliament, Friday night’s council meetings were just like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of most meetings today, and the promise of a “mild, gentle” policy has long been forgotten, if indeed it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged whether it is acceptable to party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my mind and take positions that I would otherwise never have taken in vain, regardless of whether it was in vain.
Whenever I speak in public, and it really doesn’t matter what I say, there is a critical harassment of social media that calls for condemnation, a denial of the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
I’m not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuse every day, but never withdraw.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how abuse levels have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with each request for “lack of trust” or a change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud and then “everything will be okay.”
But that’s not why I came into politics.
Even 32 years ago, when I joined the Labour Party as a student, provoked by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that literally let my classroom collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those in need, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported Friday’s demand, all I want to say is that when the country goes on a push toward Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste my time and energy loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have one message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, regardless of whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how condemnatory threats or political opportunism I am going to outlive you all, nothing will turn me away.
Chris Lezley is a member of Parliament for East Nottingham.
Ear 38 – 17 Melrose: the undefeated Ear goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the final score somewhere, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderfully entertaining match on the day of the Scottish Rugby Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, it’s all due to their superior defense, as well as their better-taken chances, that the home team has brought, and coach Peter Murci has the right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested through our matches so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Ear, they’ve taken their chances better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute score, converted by Fraser Climo, gave Ear the upper hand, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the game of Warriors, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Bagot added.
Climo delayed Ear's lead with a penalty, previously, exactly at halftime, he scored a point, so he converted a solo point to reach 17–5 for Ear in the rescue.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Andresson's point, converted by Bagot, reduced the lead by five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Rouarid Nott, who was brought out on a stretcher, and from the outset, Ear continued to struggle with Stafford McDowell's point, converted by Climo.
Ear's V.D. captain, Blair McPherson, then received a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for Bruce Colvin's extra unconverted point at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to take down Climo without the ball, McPherson unleashed a touchdown from the penalty line on the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Climo converted, as he did almost from the start again, after Kyle Rowe took the hit from David Armstrong and sent winger Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
The star of Still Game looks set for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiran looks set to move into the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The fifty-six-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, on which he is a writer and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hamfil.
The duo announced that the next nine seasons will be their last and it looks like Kirnan is planning for life after Kregleng.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source said Kirnan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade."
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a covertly faked naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a navy blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are plastered with the motto: “The sea is ours rightly.
It is our duty to come back.”
Throughout mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the longing to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the biggest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the international court on Oct. 1 after five years of debate.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course a positive outcome is expected,” said Roberto Kalsad<0xC3><0xAD>a, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see an international court ruling on big screens all over the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of varying talks, Chile is bound to negotiate a verdict to settle the dispute.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president of indigenous origin, facing a controversial battle for re-election next year, also relies heavily on Monday's verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said solemnly at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that it will not change much even if it rules in their favor.
The U.N. body based in the Netherlands will not be able to allocate territory to Chile and said it would not decide on the outcome of the talks.
That the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final arguments indicate that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And the last four years may have reversed the cause of Bolivia instead of improving it.
“The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes,” Zarate said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric undermined Chile’s remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreement,” he said.
Callasdia also rejected that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the problem of the sea as a political backing.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“A decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it won’t have nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can’t trust Washington.
Mr. Ree was speaking before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was "fiction" to believe that the prolonged sanctions and U.S. objections to a declarative end to the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to a declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit.
Paris fashion magazines unveil the latest line of massive hats that are on their way to the biggest stores near you
If you want to improve the size of your collection of drops or completely block out the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the track that dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats launched Instagram in the summer and these designers sent their creations that catch the eye on the track.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide rim in the form of feathers that flooded the head of the model.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons with zircons, magic hats, and even pineapples, but they’re not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lector more than high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving gear complete with glasses and a diving tube, and the other looked like a melted cornet of ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you are in luck.
Followers of the style predict that huge hats can come to stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after La Bomba, the two-foot wide-rimmed straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult fashion house behind the overly impractical hat that spread through social media sent another great creation down the track, a straw bag for a beach with a size almost equal to the height of the model it was carrying.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia brothel and a white leather handle, was the piece featured in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus at Fashion Week in Paris.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in stores next summer because the designer has caused so much impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only enhanced by individual and group success in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent Schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the careers they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement customized school programs, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable as an elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it will make him imaginary.
If you speak to him in his language, it will strike him in the soul.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can note that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest rate of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language learners achieved a higher grade of 5+.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher score of "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages are now, as an elective subject, viewed at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the programs of independent schools, as well as in other places.
A 2014 survey by the Occupation and Skills Commission found that of the reasons employers cited for failure to fill jobs, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs looking for languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot an advantage over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 OK adults, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent, or 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on the post-classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important in the OK when looking into the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be numerous languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future may bring.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this must be replicated in schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
"Il faut bien le fare" (it must be done).
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will lead the Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait was almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in his first pre-season game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play, it is not yet decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Valton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers season.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
A YouTube channel for Trump's rally in West Virginia.
President Donald Trump launched a series of rallies as part of the campaign, tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five scheduled rallies next week, including visits to sloping places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill the vacant seat in the Supreme Court is at rest, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans could lose control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. East Coast Time Zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia via the internet with a live stream on YouTube.
This week, Trump is likely to address the hearing of the man who nominated him for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, which has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with the expected postponement of the vote in the Senate by up to a week, while the investigation is ongoing.
The primary goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
From there, President Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week were aimed at "inciting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority that they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"Control in Congress is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible with the start of a tough campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Arranged at the Wesbanko arena in Willing, the rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media outlets from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro news.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a country where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not good for Morrissey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls," Simon Hider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Copa Ryder 2018: The U.S. team has shown courage in the fight to keep alive the hopes of the start of individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the four on Saturday afternoon might have been just what he needed at the Ryder Cup.
The bendability of luck is a completely fictional sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
Who do you think is lucky now?
"They had a lead of six points, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky I guess," Jordan Spit said at the end of today's game.
The Europeans have the advantage, of course, a lead of four points and twelve more games.
Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in the sail although they have enough stimulus, if nothing else then the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Sleep was great and led by example.
Those strong shouts of celebration became stronger throughout his game, with a key blow leading to a four-four draw when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His punch with which they won the match on the 15th was met with a similar cry, such that he tells you that he believes that the American team is not out of play.
"You just have to dig deep and take care of your match," Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for every player.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but wonderful duo of Europe are four out of four and can't go wrong.
They were the only pair without bad strikes on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bad strikes on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensured that they are the players who will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players who will provide a potential European victory when the sun goes down behind Le Golf National, except for Fleetwood.
Both are preferred at the same time on different holes.
However, talks about European fame remain unwarranted.
Buba Watson and Web Simson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of doubles, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A missed shot and two doubles from the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double couples and fours are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give themselves, the advice they don’t listen to, and the way the strategy can be changed at once.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved significant leadership in the final day, but the four-day season also showed that the U.S. team can fight even though some, especially Americans, had doubts.
Europeans lead 10-6 in the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter with a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's lead in doubles and fours 10-6 ahead of the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at the Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which struggled to keep the trophy he lost at Haseltin two years ago, dominated the American team that had many early-morning doubles losses and won the series 3-1.
The Americans provided more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but could not reach the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 individual matches a week to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, dubbed "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair ever to win four points in the first four games in the history of the Rider's Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in doubles, they played great and beat worn-out Woods and American rookie Bryson Deshambu with an even more pronounced 5&4 score.
Woods, who ran through two matches on Saturday, at times played great, but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in doubles and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the duration of the morning doubles, returned as a partner to Henryk Stanson in the 2&1 defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans did not have everything after their pleasant, windy day south-west of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a two-pointer target for Americans on Saturday.
They scored a decisive 2&1 victory over Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the doubles and later returned to beat Pulter and Rory McLaughlin 4&3 in fours, but lost in the opening, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a certain team recovered from a lack of four points in an individual game, although as the title holders, the team of Furyk was sufficiently equal to retain the trophy.
After the second two days, however, the Sunday counterattack seems to remain over them.
North Korea says “no chance” of disarming unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the prolonged sanctions deepened distrust in the United States and that there was no chance the country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities, and committing against nuclear proliferation.
“However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions, there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to the "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement appeared to be significant because it did not reject nuclear disarmament unilaterally.
Ree alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit of the current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula," he said.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States argues that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to relinquish strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament in the first place' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even opposes the 'declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can kneel on our knees is a vain dream for people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions are deepening our mistrust.”
Ree did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, it would not have been Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year's, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after a "Mr. Evil President" called Trump "only".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must continue in full and without exception until fully, finally, nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent funding for Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea just hours later because of "gangster demands."
North Korea has committed to a meeting with Moon this month over disarmament of a missile plant, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as moves to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Are Taking Courses to Get Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to combat the growing macho culture of learning by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing when it comes to basic self-care.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, is designing the course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech on the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?’
She said that no one, ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic performance, and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director of health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after they discovered that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there’s a picture of a student’s home where students press on coffee cups, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of the students right away.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know about the effects on health when you choose to smoke a cigarette,” added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of pride in "working all night" still exists, he said, and in addition, modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, with good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go hungry.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course across the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to require all graduates to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students think about setting an alarm about when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the electronic screens and the LED-light that shifts the circuit.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal knocked down Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's hit sent Steven Gerard's relegated team into a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to register their first win after the February 4–1 triumph at St. John's, but Gerry Holt's team inflicted a second defeat on Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team eight points behind the runners-up.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' line-up lost inspiration and chances of equalization.
Now the Rangers fell to sixth place, and Livingston climbed to third and are only behind Hibernian according to the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after line judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after he was apparently hit by a remote object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Air in the semi-finals of the Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 of Livingston who scored a point with Harts last week and would have been happy with the way his well-trained line-up suffocated opponents at every chance.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score a point, two minutes after the start when Menga's first play broke Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
Then Kihan Jacobs's long-distance shot reached Captain Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow could only play openly in the defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should get a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Stephen Lawles collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson gave no sign of approving the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers managed to score only two shots to the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly failed to score from Lasana Kulibali's header and Ovi Edaria's weak shot.
Although the start of the 34th minute of Livingston may have been the opposite during the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with the Jacobs strike.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who with a cold head chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the winger passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with a blockade.
But Livingstone managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoyed, with Litgow and Hackett capturing many of the long additions.
Holt's team could have extended the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor did well and prevented Jacobs from playing head-to-head in the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glen Middleton had another penalty request after colliding with Jacobs, but Thomson again declined.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one side of our almanac "On Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE WILL REMOVE ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since becoming the mainstay of science, the Geiger counter has also become the mainstay of popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Bell of Colorado, in which the seemingly unbelievable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans perform:
Man: “What is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release radioactivity into the minerals.”
Evans: “Say it, it must have jumped now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Resistant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to “Watch” Resistant Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the removed cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their modification in the laboratory.
You can “see” a protein common in many types of cancer, and then be returned to the body
The trial vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the removed cells, ovarian cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their modification in the laboratory, so that they can "see" a protein common in many types of cancer called HER2, and then their return to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot.”
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofski explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and their “learning” how to target cancer cells works in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump outing, wearing a cap with his motto, after performing Saturday night live.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live show Saturday night, after a useless performance in which he lauded U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the performance of the third song that night, dubbed the City of Ghosts, in which he wore a cap with the caption “Make America Famous Again,” he began criticizing the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The Saturday night live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee in connection with the allegations of sexual assault of Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's fallout was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that it was difficult to get behind the scenes because of his drop.
“I was laughed at behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't show up with that drop."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me that I was in the submerged place, he said, according to Washington Exeminer.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the sunken place?" He said that he would "put on his superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try it with love.”
His comments drew outrage from the audience at least twice, and the crew of the evening show looked embarrassed, Varaijeti reported, one man told the publisher: "The whole studio is busy".
The news was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
News surprised many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
News received support from the leader of the conservative TPsAD group, Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest ghosts: I THANK YOU for opposing the crowd."
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West “was her own and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, in which case he is now "formally known as Caine West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff and P Didi.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihacmore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before a high court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington has attacked toxic masculinity.
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as a skilled swordsman as John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho-hero stereotype when he said such on-screen roles meant that young boys often felt they had to be tough to be respected.
In a statement for the Sunday Times culture section, Keith said he believes "something's wrong" and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #SegaKazjum.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted he had "strong feelings" about the issue.
“Personally, I have strong feelings, at the moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What do you learn from TV, and what on the street, which makes young boys feel that they have to have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
“There’s something wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in Game of Thrones sequels when the series ends next summer, saying that he "ends with battles and horses".
From November, Keith will perform in Sam Shepherd's True West revival, which is the story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks getting to know his wife Rose is the best thing that ever came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so in a way she gave me the future family and my life in the future,” he said.
Rose played Gamerite, a character who had a love interest with Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 have been affected in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new events were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly throughout parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health authorities told a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grew by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data provided by a member of staff associated with a Republican senator as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed accusations that a member of her staff had released the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were on “ultra-right” sympathizers and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, released by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing over allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Cavanaugh, a nominee for a Supreme Court judge.
The information emerged shortly after Kavanaugh's interrogation by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstate have announced that the IP address identifying the source of the announcement is linked to the Waters office and information about a Waters staff member has been released, Hill said.
“These unfortunate allegations are completely false and are an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of those false and false accusations – is in no way responsible for the information provided.
“Unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism on the internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Flysher.
“These denials are nervous,” wrote Flyscher.
“This shows that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
It must not be challenged.
He is not allowed to question the accuser’s motives.
He has to stay calm and calm.”
Fletcher appeared to have compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also announced on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s a big deal,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed "the relevant institutions and the police of the false allegations.
“We will allow the offenders to be found out,” she continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all of their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all of my staff.”
Johnny English’s Thought Attacks Again – Undermining Rowan Atkinson’s Spy Cheats
It is now traditional to look for elements of Brexit in every new film with a British relationship, and this seems to be the case for this revival of the franchise's deceptive, action-comedy Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will the careful self-laughter on the subject of how obviously we are nowhere be the new export opportunity that the nation has?
Despite this, the face with big eyes and many grimaces of the incompetent Johnny English received a license to "lock" things up a second time - his name first and foremost indicates that he is a comic creation with a wide reach, made for moviegoers in places where no English is spoken.
He is of course a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for careful glamour, looks a bit like Clouseau, has Mr. Binn's features and part of the boy who plays a note from the song "Coaches on Fire" from the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Its basis is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in Barclay’s now-forgotten TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There's a moment or two in Johnny English's latest edition.
I really liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the fins of the rotor hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but the humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" movie brands like 007 and Impossible Mission themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be meant for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy accidents aren’t as inventive and focused as they are silent stallions of Atkinson’s character Bean.
The issue that has been going on all along is that the UK is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super secret spy network in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agent on duty - a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combative figure and already suffers from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson gives her all in this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is nothing special about the script that would work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retirees.
And that means calling himself Johnny English, who now works as a private school teacher, but "on black" gives classes for secret agents: there are a few good guys here, when English offers a school for espionage that resembles a rock academy.
An Englishman is summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former collaborator Bow, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, in a relationship with a submarine commander, a comical role in which Vicky Pepperdine is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for screwing up all things in the Royal Secret Service are back in action and meet fatally beautiful Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Boo begin their odyssey of absurdities: transformed as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; make a desolation after smuggling themselves on the luxury yacht of the Wallace; and English begins a real-life anarchy when she tries to use it all.
All the brakes are removed for the final sequence, but as courteous and noisy as it is, there is a lot of children's TV in the whole movie.
Nice, moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give the role of Rowan Atkinson who will use his talent?
Labour Denys Plan to Work Four Days a Week but Get Paid for Five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week – but be paid five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to take advantage of the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but they would take the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea "fits" with the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country more prone to workers.
The transition to a four-day working week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high-ranking member of the party told the Sunday Times: "The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration consistent with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to adopt such an idea, as the Green Party advocated a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration was not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a strategy of the party and the party does not consider such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonald used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonald said he was determined to seize the power of "faceless directors" and "profits" in utilities.
The Chancellor's plans in the shadows also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get back all because the Labour government could make "deductions" because of unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds, whereby 10 percent of the capital of private companies will belong to employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lyndsey Graham, John F. Kennedy make a statement for "60 Minutes" on whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could reconsider
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could persuade some Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview published on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelli asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them think.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I think so,” Kennedy said.
“I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was strong, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s voice, however, looks like it was carved into a stone.
“My decision has been made for Brett Cavanaugh and a shocking indictment is needed,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett was vigorously denying it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blakey Ford.
“Everything she said couldn’t be confirmed.
It's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring famous stars and has an impressive mission; an end to poverty.
Now it is held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizen Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances by names like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to give
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or some other useful piece of work to help them get up to speed.
But how successful is a Global Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to look for something or just one more case of “click-activism” – people who feel they make a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a message to Twitter?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “activities” from supporters, which acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped spur world leaders to unveil a commitment and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and announcements resulting from their activities, of which $10 billion have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges are the Power of Food, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers, dedicated to “helping children to use their potential,” which pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda for aid around the country’s poor diet.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens the same as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a landmark in history,” said Ambassador Tracy Ulman of Food Power, in front of the crowd at the 2018 London live concert.
The group also said more than 5,000 activities were undertaken related to calls to improve the diet of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, The Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – we will never succeed.
But like the big civic and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janell Mona are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Fournes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy as a “blockade” to curb Russian energy exports - Interior Ministry
Washington could "if necessary" use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinki said, as quoted by Washington Exeminent.
According to Zinki, Russia’s involvement in Syria – namely, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government – is a bulwark for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of energy trading, just as they are doing in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that seaways remain open and if necessary with a blockade to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki addressed attendees at an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is effectively the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stakes and replacing fuel,” he said, as he spoke of Russia as “an awkward pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement came after the Trump administration launched a mission to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to back down from the “inappropriate” NordTech 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made a “captive” of Moscow from Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tech 2 pipeline, which is worth $11 billion and is expected to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position met with resistance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the first person at the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will carefully consider" whether to run for president in 2020, said the senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "carefully consider" whether to run for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, and that means a woman on the forehead,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether to run for president.”
Warren assessed President Donald Trump's work during a city hall meeting and said he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
“I’m too concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominates as a Supreme Court judge, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her constituency think she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters from Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent support such an application.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential nomination and 48 percent opposed.
Other well-known names from the Democratic Party that are being discussed for nomination in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin speaks about the post-traumatic syndrome of Track Paylin at the Donald Trump rally
Track Paylin, 26, has spent a year in Iraq since reporting in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after he comes back, I know how other families who are torn apart because of the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with are feeling,” she told a crowd at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said her son and other military veterans "are coming back a little different, they're coming back solidified, they're coming back and wondering if there's any respect for what they and their fellow airmen have for each other."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasila Police Department.
18 U.S. states and the city of Washington support a challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington support a challenge to the new U.S. policy that prevents asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the city of Washington submitted a petition to the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who disputes the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Parliament case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was incarcerated in Texas.
The state defender who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum claims originate in the United States, as nations with ongoing gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 immigration complaints board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington City Public Defender Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of lawmaking at the federal, state, and international levels."
“Federal law requires all asylum claims to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the claim and such provision violates that principle,” the petition reads.
In addition, advocates in the letter argue that policies that prevent immigrants from entering are detrimental to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs “to offer the necessary workforce.”
U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never conceived as a solution to all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are being made in Palu as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
“He’s very tense,” 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said as she comforted her male baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Each minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There is no clean water.”
Residents return to their demolished homes and choose from their haunted objects to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, rested in front of Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent successive minor earthquakes.
Tears fell into his eyes as he described the powerful earthquake in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think so," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Troubling’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily listing the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday spoke about China Daily's paid addition to the De Moine Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6, China dismissed the accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election marks a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which they balance import tariffs with each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters from states such as Iowa, backed by Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing is hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the De Moine Register, "now doubles the bullying with propaganda advertisements in our free press."
“In the dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government is abusing the fostered American tradition of free speech and free media by placing advertisements in the De Moine Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the nearby newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see a real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economic trajectory, because the media are controlled by the toughest,” he said.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China has rejected his offer to publish" on the column, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans distance themselves from women's votes ahead of midterm elections because of a debate with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
With many Republicans not watching or defending Brett Cavanaugh's nomination in the Supreme Court despite several accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already stated that they want to continue voting.
There is no going back from such things," Grant Reicher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School of Political Science, wrote of Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Reicher said he doubted that the pressure of the FBI investigation of Senator Jeff Fleck (Republican of Arizona) would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, demonstrators shouted "November is Coming!" in the Senate hallway, when Republicans, who have control in the legal affairs committee, decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Meops, Solisy Forge.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high," said Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
“People are already saying they are tall; that’s right.
But they can be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court justice’s nominee, analysts suggest there could be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," Michael Stile, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to the NBC news.
"It's not just about the vote in the committee or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will go to a hearing, it's also about how Republicans dealt with this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, for the news channel.
However, Americans are divided over who to trust after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, although more accept the first-remembered side.
A new survey by Yu-Gow shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Cavanaugh probably or definitely lied at the time of the testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following Fleck's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one more, of Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, under oath, last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accuses her of showing her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrapt, is a company built on the open-source platform Solid, Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination."
“We have to do that now,” he said of the start-up business.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "data warehouse on the Internet" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Sleak, and Spotify being all available on a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data warehouse on the Internet is that it only depends on the user who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrapt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is to provide the company with resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several development developers with a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a statement, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Network Consortium of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Recently, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over Internet neutrality.
Even at the start of Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m a big optimist for the new era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Famous Victorian Cross Bearer of World War I
The only Anglican priest who received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, Honorary Bernard Van received recognition on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Belenglis and Lechaukur.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out that he had received the highest British military honor.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "an incredible symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "under a very thick fog and under a strong fire of cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to where he was fired and with "greatest courage" led forward, before himself attacking a cannon nest and disabling three of the guards.
Colonel Van was assassinated by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s works were “something I know I’ll never be able to fulfill, but it’s something that doesn’t make us humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of the combined martial arts stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been up all night to watch Belator 206, and you don't have the opportunity to watch the main event.
The list from San Jose included 13 fights, including six with the main card that were shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were stunned when the channel switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after staying up until the early hours because of the fight.
One Twitter fan described the transfer of a children's cartoon file as "something awkward."
"The law is that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so it had to be switched to a children's program," Dave Schwarz, vice president of marketing and communications at Belator, said when asked about the broadcast.
“Pepa Pig,” yes.
The company's chairman, Scott Kucker, said they would work on a schedule that would involve viewers from Britain in the future.
“I think when I think about re-release, I think we can probably find a solution,” Kuker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time and on Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, we got a lot of messages on the transfer, and none of them were kind.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a legal issue.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights, instead of six - as we usually do - we tried to deliver more for the fans and exaggerated.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Albums on a Desert Island: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ to Sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “everyone isn’t like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4's first show, Discs on a Desert Island, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a side character in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, those feelings of inferiority and diversity were the things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist has become a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said of falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lens Black, who met him in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Dayley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at an early age” — he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it’s hard to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his views" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dayley said his father didn’t agree to die and one of the last things he asked them was if they had tickets to London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be here to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held my hand when it stopped breathing and when it actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized it was invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze.
"I just knew this was what I've been dreaming of all my life - jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Pride by Heather Small - which he had turned in his head in preparation for the Olympics and which he was still teased about.
Discs on the desert island of BBC Radio 4 is on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michaelson, a horse not in shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mikkelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup, but will have to change shape to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Michaelson, who plays at the biennial event, a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furick during Saturday's doubles and quads.
Instead of being in the spotlight, as the United States often represents, the five-time winner, he split his time to wind and practice his game, the range, in the hope of fixing what silences him.
He has never been the best leader, even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National, where distant rough hits are a regular punishment for inattention.
And if the field itself isn’t scary enough, Michaelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who plays in pairs with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual games, start hard, the game of Michaelson can be decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
“He fully understood the role he played today, touched my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furick said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a part of the celebrities and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think of it as a two-game game.
I was thinking more, but it was over and we thought we had to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
Mikelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most-played games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup where he has never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 games lost and seven halves, although Furick said his presence brings something intangible to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's contemplative, he wants to joke with people, and he's a great man at team meetings."
“I think the younger players were having fun playing with him, just like this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers a lot more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Björn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that significant lead ahead of individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncompromising position.
The Dane made his debut at a game at Valderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a lead of five points ahead of the Americans, but "crossed the finish line with only the batsmen", with the lowest lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"I remind myself that we had a great lead at Valderama; we had a great lead at Brooklyn, when we lost and at Valderama, when we won a little bit," said Bjorn, the picturesque, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday's 10-6 with a lead.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
You're ready for tomorrow.
Go out and play as you should.
It’s not over until the game is over.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy and the focus remains on that.
"I've been saying all along, I'm focusing on 12 players on our team, but we're fully aware of the opposing side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn added, satisfied with the results of his players on the difficult golf course: "I don't want to give premature assessments on this issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
We’re going to have a game tomorrow, and that’s different.
It’s great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all your abilities as a golfer are tested.
That’s the message that needs to be sent to the players, to give their all tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to give his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furick will require players to play better individually than they played in pairs, with exceptions being Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furick himself was at both ends of the changes on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every word out there,” he said when asked how Ben Cranshaw, the captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start like the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the momentum moves in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure to the mid-games.
We set the line appropriately and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of facing Rory McClure's most important match first and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
“I’ve decided to perform this way with the guys because I think that’s how we’re going to cover everything,” Bjorn said of the choice in the individual games.
The new German warship has been postponed.
The latest German Navy frigate was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace outdated Cold War warships, but it won’t happen until at least next year because of the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wittenberg frigate class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Citt, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the troubled issues after delivery hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wittenberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be a replacement for the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Among other important features is less frequent maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from domestic ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that modern warships — which should allow Germany to have power across the oceans — will already be obsolete as they enter service, DiCite notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate reached the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blom and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wittenberg class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the older Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is drastically above the planned weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar-class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) - an increase from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the latest frigates are particularly important because of warnings about Germany's declining naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the navy "is deprived of ships that can be deployed."
The representative said that the problem has worsened over time, because the old ships have been withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wittenberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Trust interrogates the secret life of bats
A new survey of the property in the Scottish highlands is being conducted to find out how bats use the area in their search for food.
There is hope that the findings will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help in conducting protection activities in the future.
A study by the National Trust for Scotland scientists will follow ordinary and soprano bats, as well as long-eared brown bats and daubenton bats at Inverrow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
The staff of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds from all the recordings will determine the frequency depending on the type of bats.
A map of the habitats will then be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at N-T-Es, hopes the results will reveal which areas of life are most important for bats and how each species is used.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development that affect the beds and the loss of housing.
Windmills and lights also present a risk, as well as sticky tapes for flies and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Lilacs are not actually blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
An-Ti-Es, which takes care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation even establishes the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Trive property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property manager David Thomson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
“Here in Triv we have a great area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, very old two and very good living quarters.
But there are a lot of unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us learn more about what they need to progress.”
He stresses that it is important to check for bats before renovations of the properties are carried out because the unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and infants, and destroy the entire local population.
Lilacs are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer in the Lilac Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and our other species, we just don’t know how they live.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges, Lawyers Will Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "fake news," adding that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus was charged with raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly then paid her $375,000 not to mention the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking to a live video on Instagram to its 142 million followers, hours after the charges were brought, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was reported today is fake news," the five-time Golden Ball winner said in front of his camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that’s part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” added the player, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they called "an inadmissible transfer of doubts from private life," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Shertz said the player would seek damages for "moral damage in addition to an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident, which was the subject of the charges, occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a "99 percent" "good boy", but dropped below that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claimed she went to the police and pictures were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to a non-judicial settlement because she feared revenge" and was concerned "that she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to change the deal because she has been traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer moved to Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'always regrets' loss of car makers
Britain will "always regret" losing its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clarke said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota-Britain had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border stalls in the case of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston - which is manufactured by Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a cessation of production at our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director in Burnston.
Other carmakers in Britain have expressed concern about how cross-border trade will function if the EU leaves without a deal, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-Em-We, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers call the risks of the logistics chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates according to the “exact time” system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU, for cars as ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a break in the border that the industry says could cause delays and defects in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily supply of inventory at the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and production will stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May’s plan for future EU relations was “precisely designed to avoid such border checks.”
“We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will allow us not only success that we will enjoy in the present, but to seize this opportunity,” he said of today’s BBC Radio 4 program.
“Evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the long run that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a union representative at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once he takes off those jobs, he will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with deputy public defender Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as a Supreme Court judge continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential lawbreaking by the president.
Whether Trump will fire his deputy public defender and thereby threaten Miller’s independence has fueled months of turmoil in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report, however.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women he accused of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine B.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI into the lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which would further delay the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting has not yet been determined, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week in view of all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see how things go, and I always try to keep the press properly informed.”
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a briefing for reporters at the White House since September 10.
The driver, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings was not due to a reluctance to "great influence" from television journalists, though he added, "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organizes more question and answer sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the president of the United States, it's far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do that more often, and you are witnessing that we have been doing that consistently over the past few weeks, and talks with the President of the United States will replace briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is so with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance before the assembled journalists.
Secretary of Health with a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland’s national health system regarding Brexit-related fears
The Secretary of Health wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of resolved status applications for EU citizens who work in lower-level public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: “The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued throughout the summer, with a view to taking the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of a no-deal.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the workforce, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are of benefit to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Cristion Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker, was undergoing an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He came to the sideline of the playground and just piled on the ground,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen off the playground, then put him in a stretcher and took him to a further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is still no information about the type/stage of the injury” and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecromby is a second-year student and played his first season in a red jersey at Tennessee State after the transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five rebounds on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 rebounds this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying a property in the UK
According to Tori’s new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, funds that will be used to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high-earning individuals.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, with additional funds to intensify the government’s efforts to improve the situation with the homeless.
The additional amount that in addition to the current administrative fee includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of a property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which has led to higher prices and has caused difficulties for people buying the property for the first time to get involved in this process of buying a home.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "towns of spirits" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was released just weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major construction firms of offering high prices on properties that keep the land, but did not use it and asked Ms May to change access quotas in order to fix the "shameful housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including apartment controls and ending evictions for no justifiable reason.
He also wants councils to give them greater powers to build new homes.
Ms May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to returning to the British dream of making life better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
“Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not in order for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to be able to buy homes as easily as valuable British residents.
The dream of owning one’s own home for many people has become too far-fetched, and the humiliation of the homeless too realistic.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "ultimate ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland's national club in the future.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which is currently third in the Premier League with only three points less than the top club.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it,” Ross told BBC Sportsound.
“But I grew up constantly watching Scotland at Hampden with my father and always something was dragging me back.
"However, I could only get such an opportunity if I was successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as manager of "Sunderland" include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardiche, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kean, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he did not feel any concern knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success at the moment is assessed by ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task for this club to get there, but I will probably think that I have achieved success here only if I bring the club back there."
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, which he entered after working as an assistant to the boss at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from their third-league defeat and brought St. Mirren back from the edge of a championship loss the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crossroads for me,” he recalls at the Alloa takeover.
“I sincerely believed that a career as a manager is the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, I made enough money from it, and I enjoyed certain high perks.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of a manager.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever during my entire adult life.”

According to one study, the perfect time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA for Business Consulting Services said in determining these figures: "Sunshine weather and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of the pubs were 2 percent higher than in June.
The drop in sales of 1.8 percent of restaurants in June worsened further during July.
Pubs and bars where beverages are mostly sold have seen a much higher increase compared to previous years, as opposed to restaurants where there has been a decline.
The pubs in which food is mainly sold were also badly affected by the sunny periods, although not as dramatic as the owners of restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales by just three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s holiday and hospitality analyst, said: “These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
Time and the impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is not at all surprising that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the drop in sales of 4.8 percent over a period of one year will be especially devastating as a complement to the ongoing pressures that are created by costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of places where food is mainly sold and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide the much-needed respite."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a stalemate in the release of new brands.

One in five children has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, has a secret social media profile that he hides from his parents and teachers.
The study, which involved 20,000 high school students, showed an increase in the number of "fake Instagram" profiles.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” profile that they show to their parents
One in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, creates a social media profile that he hides from adults.
The survey, which involved 20,000 high school students, showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Instagram profiles, an abbreviation for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean “main” profile that they show to their parents, while also having other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter ran into a teenager who asks others to “rape” her.
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters'' and Headmistresses'' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them was secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" of the Scottish Athletics board
Elid Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most distinguished athlete, and President Ian Beatty described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and global athletic community has tremendous respect for Elid and we are confident that the athletes in Scotland would be of tremendous benefit if she became a member of the board," he said.
Doyle said: "I am ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really make my contribution and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200m and 400m titles at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, despite winning a total of four gold medals at the Olympics, and who now appears regularly as a BBC commentator, was unable to walk after undergoing a transitional hiatus.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
My doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
The whole process was arduous, but I managed to recover completely, again I can go and do agile exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
An advertisement for a breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows caused a division of opinions on the Internet
A breast pump company has sparked an online divide of opinion when it published an advertisement in which breastfeeding mothers were compared to molting cows.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the world's coolest breast pump", user-oriented technology company Elvie has released a humorous ad inspired by music videos to showcase the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a cowhouse filled with hay on a song whose lyrics sound like this: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed these aren't whiskers, these are my breasts."
“Pump, pump, I feed the babies, pump, pump, I milk my breasts.”
However, the ad that was posted on the Facebook page of the company sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it emphasizes the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, just like us, need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except for the fact that their children are stolen from them just a few days after they are born," one commenter said.
Elvie's breast pump discreetly fits into the breast pump bra ("Elvie"/"Mother")
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Another added: “Really inappropriate advertising.”
Others, however, defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "funny."
“I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd buy a pump like this if I still had milk.
I felt like a cow because of the ice cream.
It's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a brilliant product," one of the commentators said.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement intended for mothers who milk (often at their workplaces or in their toilets) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that defies or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing while discrete pumps were being pierced in their breasts.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires, no tubes, and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even leave the house while milking.
Ana Ballarin, partner and RDR at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By paralleling the women who milk milk and the dairy cows we wanted to milk milk with the help of a pump and the challenges that it brings to put the same in the center of attention, while also showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pupa brings.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has been featured in all titles.
During fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the fashion runway for designer Martha Yakubovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp on Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has risen sharply, even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the sharp rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration that have made it harder for children to be hosted by sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid of threatening their own stay in the country if they asked to be a child sponsor.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally reside in the country, and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That's why we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr Albens said.
In order to deal with cases with children faster, authorities have introduced new rules under which some of them will be required to appear in court within one month of being arrested, rather than within 60 days, as shelter workers say they voted the previous standard.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not in person, in order to bring their case for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit for relief will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become upset and depressed, which can lead to violent falls or attempts to escape, say shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where due to its size there is a greater likelihood of neglecting signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could aggravate the traumas that most of them are already facing.
Syria told the US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian territory under the pretext that they were participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they will be treated appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “lead this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “every illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Muallem said conditions were good for them to return and accused "some of the Western countries" of spreading "irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They politicize the question that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to Al Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
U.N. Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition in the near future to draw up a new constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless his presidential term is prematurely terminated by impeachment and scandal, which is likely to be the hope of many liberals.
In what will undoubtedly be “The most dramatic presidential finale ever seen!”
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in viewers.
Since 2014, the hit-time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Nielsen said Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time of impact, 1.7 million more than four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news was announced.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to because this isn't something we understand," said Neil Baer, ABC's chief television producer of the drama Designated Survivor for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after Capitol's demise.
Nel Scowell, a veteran comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
“He said, ‘Because I think he’s really funny,’” Mrs. Scowell told me.
There is also a certain amount of fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, and the well-being of the global economy.
The exclusion from all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.

The influx of foreign funds in the tightest midterm elections in the race for the Upper House
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district receives a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts from where there are two candidates in the race for the same seat.
For this recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh, Democratic Representative Connor Lamb is running, who won a seat in another area of the snap election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th congressional district, and which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional district.
The maps were altered after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas were manipulated in favor of Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional district is a tough contest to fund campaigns between the party's main sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congressional Campaign Committee ("DCCC") and the Republican Party's National Campaign Committee ("NRCC").
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the extraordinary election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district held in March, which was characterized by widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place has been taken by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has conquered the area by a margin of 20 points.
Politicians give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for its support for China, and then resigned
Diplomats stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the basis of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan as a country," said Nauert in a statement.
But only in relation to El Salvador, penalties were taken into account, which received US aid of about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and the high rates of unemployment and murder in it.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed the high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the country.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials have stressed that they want the conference to move forward and effectively put an end to any thinking about punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal reflections on the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn History.
The next thing that can happen is the release of Special Counsel Robert Miller’s report on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is currently a lot of solid evidence in the public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign is related to Russia in its attack on our election.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility in that body as he prepares to reappear before voters, and possibly before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There is a lot of uncertainty here, and I don’t want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable, nor of his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or postponed.
Americans are now facing several such points of change.
What if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the hot seat since the paper announced that last year he had secretly proposed filming the president and speculated that he was inconvenient for the position he holds.
Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we proceed if Brett Cavanaugh’s new investigation requested by the FBI is incomplete or unlawful, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And first of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I don’t think that will happen because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewess from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on a table with a swastika logo.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorance of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers are hosting the clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and are aware of the fact that after the unresolved match played against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, the victory over the Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify for the G Group.
Graeme Dorens, the midfielder due to a knee injury, was prevented from appearing in the season all the way to an unresolved 2-2 match with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that score as a springboard to greater achievements.
"That was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game believing we could achieve something and came back with a win.
Maybe we could give a little more in the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and we were better.
On Thursday we have another big European night ahead of us.
I hope we win three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a good result in the last game, but I am sure that with the support of the fans we will come back and get a positive result.
"Last year was definitely a difficult year given everything that has happened, my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that now we can move forward, leave last season behind us and achieve success.”
Women can’t sleep at night because of this fear associated with retirement savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in a study conducted by Nationwide said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps to discuss the same,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here’s where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care for you if you don’t share your desires with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how care can be obtained because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor as well: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your choices for financing long-term care can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid cash life insurance policy, which can help you cover the costs or provide self-insurance with your own funds, if you have them.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal battles right from the start.
Take out full health care so that you can empower a person of trust to supervise your medical care and ensure that health care professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think carefully about your financial resources as well.
In this way, you would choose a person of trust to carry out financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medications he drinks and his allergies?
Take note of these details in writing to be prepared.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.

Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was returning home from his departure.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officials described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (British summer time) as an "accidental act."
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police appeal to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communications, aid workers are unable to receive information from Dongala County, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-degree quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Below are a few key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) off the coast in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which represents an administrative region within a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by the tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also struck western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them were drowned.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck an area near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached up to 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake with a shallow focus hit the Pidi Jaya district of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police officers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is at the Mat-Su detention facility with the option to leave if he pays $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he was pronounced before the court, a statement from the network said.
Palin faces three Class A violations, which means he can be sentenced to up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a B-class offense, a one-day prison sentence, and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaska Veteran's Court is pending.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, meddling in a domestic violence crime report, and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son's violent behavior stemmed from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted, and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York City
NEW YORK (AP) - Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack in which eight people were killed, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck at the Home Depot in October to carry out an attack on a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and to overtake pedestrians and cyclists who found themselves in his path.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a report of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, it is possible to pronounce the death penalty on both of these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury launched an indictment against Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight counts of murder for the purposes of racketeering, which is usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and mob destruction.
The attack required "detailed planning and intent," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's way of carrying out the attack as "gross, cruel and perverse."
"Saifulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused, injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Laure Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlej, Hernan Mehmet, Hernan Mehmet and Hernan Diena"
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since a death penalty case was prosecuted in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Calid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both were sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He said he was innocent on all 22 counts of the charge.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a guilty plea and issuing a life sentence without the possibility of acquittal, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved in them," he said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of the Tory Party says Najjel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed during a protest at the Tory Party conference today that he would “mobilize the People’s Army.”
The former leader of the UKIP party said politicians must "feel the heat" from eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's MPs suggesting he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backer Peter Bone at the Birmingham march said the UK would have been "outside the EU" if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces in terms of uniting her deeply divided members was underscored by the Counter-Brexit members of the Tory Party who joined a special protest against Brexit that was taking place in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Chequers plan despite the attacks by pro-Brexit, counter-Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue her attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that she would force Eurosceptics and Labour members to choose between her package and "chaos."
Mr. Bon told the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "reject the Chequers plan."
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would have been outside the EU by now," he said.
The Wellington MP added, "I will support Brexit, but we have to reject the Chequers plan."
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: “We were not fighting in world wars for now to be subordinated.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bon rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory and pro-Brexit party, also attended the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not well-received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well-received by our party and our activists who are actually those who take to the streets and to whom our victory in the elections is due.
Please give up the Chequers plan and start listening to us."
In a message to Ms May, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at the rally that politicians must “feel the heat” if they intend to hand over the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let you get away with it.”
In a message to the enthralled crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and that will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, counter-Brexit fighters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists appeared this weekend wearing banners with the inscription "Toriyevs vs. Brexit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference regarding the application created by the party.
"These are people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the necessary technology for Canada plus, for a border without controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“This is a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Jeff Dill, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with voters after Trump came to the presidency, in which he used the format of a city hall.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top.”
Man Arrested for Shooting and Death of LSU Basketball Player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Sims from the LSU team, which happened on Friday, was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dieon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man from the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University in the early hours of Friday.
"Wed Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and as a result he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was present at the crime scene, had a gun, and had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to a police station in East Baton Rouge Parish.
As a 192-cm-tall junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 appearances last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 catches per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Louis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with their orders secured him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Walteri Bottas qualified ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the half-position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on fire while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vetel entered boxing first and left Hamilton to fight the turmoil at the end of the group, something that was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing round one later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the one-on-one action forced the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the interior at his own risk to stay on the side after the double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round finished in seventh place.
He then drove most of the race and steered the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimi Raikkonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered boxing on the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen came in fourth.
Today is a tough day because Waltery did a great job throughout the weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me spend it.
The team has made a truly exceptional decision to have their own pair in the race," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasy Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate has shown people to be "wicked and rude and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's been happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and angry and reckless and dishonest," he said.
“When you look at posts and information flows and they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you publish this information?
Do you remember her answer... did you publish the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute then.
Did we publish it... No, we didn’t publish it,” he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Feinstein with information regarding the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and the same were published in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leaked information had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish her story," Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep them confidential, and I did what she asked.”
But the president doesn't seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same at Saturday's rally: "I'll tell you one thing, it was really bad body language.
“Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use citations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to regain power in any way.
You can see their malice, their inferiority, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to regain power and control," the president said in a statement.
"Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the match against Dundee
Dundee Stars compensated for the loss of the Elite League game on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took advantage of two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney scored an advantage for the host over Dwayne to return the Giants leadership.
Francois Bushard equalised for the Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third loss of the season within the Elite League for the Adam Kifis, who returned with a 2-1 win over the Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the addition of Kendal McFall, which was provided by David Rutherford while Bovillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan secured the host's lead with 13:10, before Matt Merkart assisted Kawani to score 15:16.
The pair made sure the Giants took the lead until the first pause, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned them again with a powerful game and goal, with the result being 27:37.
Cawny and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nilsen for the first time secure Dundee's lead in the game late in the second period and he secured his team's victory halfway through the final period of the fifth match.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Flight controller killed while helping hundreds of people on a plane escape from the quake
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong successive quakes continue to devastate the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonios Gunavan Agung refused to leave the position at the control tower of Mutiara Cece Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was constantly hovering.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air plane with flight number 6321, which was at the time on the runway, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokeswoman Johannes Sirait said his decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This news broke our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the ruins, while many cannot even be accessed," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Branes that have reached six meters have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial jets carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Fast-time help carries bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse.”
Indonesian President Yoko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” asked CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man has disappeared after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now says one man has disappeared after it previously said the 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they could not find the male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it was trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed into the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"That's an extremely good job," said Janes.
Janes said he and the others managed to pass through the water that reached them in half and head towards the exits for emergencies of the plane that sank.
He said the stewardess was panicking and screaming, as well as that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working near the port's reconstruction also helped save the ship's inflatable life, transporting people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents at airlines registered in the PNG in the past two decades, but none were involved in the Air Niugini airline.
Analyst Sets Timeframe for the Night a Woman Was Burned Alive
The prosecution concluded by presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of the man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He said he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Telesis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When it was revealed on the basis of the data that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lieing because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Telis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Telesis deleted Chambers' messages and calls, as well as her contact information from her phone.
"He's erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide the case later that day.
“The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to beat the negative attitude to this genre by incorporating positive messages into their music.
Bristol's The High Breed argues that hip-hop has moved away from its origins as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and re-populate conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" recently experienced their revival through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black one?!
New York babysitter sues married couple for being fired after sending 'racist' message
A New York-based nanny sues a married couple for being fired on grounds of discrimination after mistakenly receiving a message from her mother complaining that she was "another black girl."
The couple denies that they are racist, saying the lawsuit is in fact "extortion."
Lancey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, was disappointed when she learned in 2016 that she was a black woman after the first day of work of the new caregiver, Giselle Morris.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and twice.
After realizing what she actually did, Plasco-Flaxman, feeling "uncomfortable", fired Ms. Morris, saying that their comrade-loving nanny, who is an African-American, had done her job poorly and that instead of her, the "YorkNews" expected the nanny to be F.
Ms. Morris was paid for her first working day and then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple and seeking compensation for the $350 per day redundancy over a six-month period, a commitment that would include her living with the family, the one she was originally engaged to, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things should not be done," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The married couple responded to the allegations that they were racist, saying that the dismissal of Ms. Morris was a reasonable procedure because they feared they could no longer trust her after being insulted.
“My wife was following her something she didn’t think she was doing.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But would you trust your children to a person you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Saying the lawsuit was "extortion," Plasco said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in "a very difficult situation."
“Are you going to attack someone who is in this situation?
“It’s not that bad,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won’t be able to connect to a talking bear, the new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book's acceptance, said of the letter: "It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Paddington.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before gaining inspiration to write the book from a small toy in the form of a bear, would still be optimistic if his work was not well-received, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "bitter."
For Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt a quiet pride about his potential success.
“He was a really quiet man and didn’t want to brag at all,” she said.
“But because Paddington felt so real, it was almost like having a child who has achieved something in life: and you’re proud of him even though success isn’t due to yourself.
I think Paddington's success felt that way.
Although it was a matter of creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed his merits to Paddington himself."
My daughter was on her deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"He was calling me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that he is not expected to survive," Ms. Edna-Laperuz said.
“Then Nad called me and told me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, "Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications that doctors gave her to keep pumping her heart was slowly diminishing and they were coming out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all her systems were canceled.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I couldn’t cry, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay put.”
In the end, Ms. Edna-Laperuz, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I shook my head and my tears didn’t stop.
It’s hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Sad Women Put Cards on Bridge to Prevent Suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney says her son had great potential to become a cook, as well as a contagious smile.
“Everyone remembers him for his smile.
People have always said that his smile can light up every room.
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
His 11-year-old brother was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, “I’m constantly afraid that it will have a consequential effect.”
Ms. Davis makes the cards "to let others know that there are people out there who they can talk to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit still, you have to start talking.”
Ms. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost her partner Mark with whom she was married for 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, that is, he didn't say anything," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas Day when the children opened their presents, and he did not look them in the eyes at all and did not establish any contact with them.
She said that his death is a huge trauma for all of them, but they have to find a way to get through it: “This sort of thing is ruining the family.
It's still broken.
But we have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is uncertain after the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something that resembles what he was looking for, that is, a limited-time investigation, with a limited scope, maybe we could achieve a little unity," Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he feared a split without a split.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their hesitation is due solely to the timing.
The midterm elections should be held in just a few weeks, i.e. on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man to be a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush responds to the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavanaugh who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to change the unresolved result and enter the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of refugees 'decreased' under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Beeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said that last year there were 1,127 border crossings compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher human smuggling tariffs are key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
Most of the refugees from North Korea have been granted citizenship in South Korea over time.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can be more easily crossed compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on halting denuclearization negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work toward the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday accused the U.S. of stagnation in progress from then to now.
“If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm first,” Mr. Ree said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve in Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said that if his temperament is taken into account he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman did that, they would say she was ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasy Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional at his introductory presentation, sometimes even yelling and licking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also vehemently condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony is proof that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he has proven biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"If he doesn't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's not just not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, he's not fit to serve in the court where he's in office at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about the possible verdicts that Kavanaugh will bring against the Access to Health Care Act or Roe against Wade, as he is considered the subject of conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court’s rulings.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's really wonderful, isn't it,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to use it.
It’s a really harsh criticism, months and years of gathering anger, which she can’t free herself without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do I?”
She continued, “I was helped a lot by a woman who was performing an executive role somewhere, and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her own technique, so when she became angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe she’s thinking.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think it’s brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an exhaust valve for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in an office dominated by men is when I once started crying with inexpressible anger and an elderly woman, a cold manager from whom I always had a certain fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me off.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll enjoy the fact that they’ve been able to reach you.”
Patricia Schröder at the time was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called "Monkey Business" and retired from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason for her not to consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given the fact that the campaign was started a long time ago, she did not have enough financial resources, so she vowed not to enter the race if she did not raise 2 million US dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000 each, would only give her $250.
“Do they think there should be a discount for me?” she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, that is, gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration from the system, which made it so difficult to raise funds and target the sexism to angry voters, rather than to divide.
“If you saw me, you would probably think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schröder recalls how the media reacted to the incident.
“You would think that Clinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to write on my gravestone.
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of the fire with the start of the trade war between the United States and China was staggering and despite the battle being far from over, the clash between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave his first warning earlier this year by dedicating key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly over the course of this week with the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the US from China.
Each time Beijing returned to nature, it recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth 60 billion U.S. dollars.
China has vowed to return the U.S. to the same extent, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will soon give up.
Forcing Washington to withdraw would mean accepting his demands, but public worship before the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could result in positive support for China in the long run as the interdependence of the two economies diminishes.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the onset of a sharp decline from an economic point of view in any of the countries is much more dangerous than what was previously determined by a survey by Cezanne," said Abigail Grace, a co-worker.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, the foreign minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild a country that has been devastated by a long war that has lasted for more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, which is due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists in order to bring the situation back to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that had an impact on their daily lives and lives have now been ensured.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomes assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe achieved a significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team beat the U.S. team in the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside of Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the European Ryder Cup title since 1993.
Europe regained the primacy after Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mikkelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, on his first hole hit, pointed the ball into the water in par-3 at the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all rounds, becoming one of four players to score 5-0-0 after starting the tournament in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit lost with a score of 5:4 from the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olessen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranked player, lost 2–1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have last played at the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a participant in eight Rider Cups, became the European who won the most titles in the tournament with 25.5 points over his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
This year has been really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy that I could help," said the emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He is now stepping down for his compatriot John Ram, who beat Tiger Woods, the U.S. golf legend, 2–1 on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost in all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It is an incredible statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to steer the game to low grass pitches, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
American team captain Jim Furick, after his team's disappointing game, said, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
This morning, we had a problem with the team.
We were fighting.
Drop it down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the Professional Golf Association of America and our Rider's Cup Committee and we'll continue.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to confess to them.
We've been beaten up.
