Welsh MPs do not want to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today as the AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from across the political spectrum fear this could lead to ridicule.
A representative from the Labour Party explained his group was concerned because “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means "dustete", and pwp means "fucking".
A representative of the Wales party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of the MWP is very close to the word "Muppet", which in addition to being the name of some well-known dolls, is also a British slang word for "dust".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a “uh” sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: “Of course, it is the members themselves who have the final say in what name to refer to.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly permission to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation that showed general support for renaming the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the representatives, the Commission supported the WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
Representatives are reportedly proposing alternatives, but getting all parties to agree could lead to a head start for parliamentary president Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a legislative draft for the name change over the next few weeks.
The legislation around the reform will include other changes in the way the National Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
The representatives have the final right to vote on what to call when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide if the country's name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia will be able to vote on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a claim on their territory, and has on several occasions opposed the country’s applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's Silent – the crickets in Harlem are struggling
“The elders I was talking to told me that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
“Now there are none of those.”
He said the bar break was understandable.
“People socialize with each other in different ways” nowadays, he says.
“Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local community, which everyone visits regularly.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders think. “And sooner or later they are back at the starting point.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won’t help the neighborhood’s remaining refuges.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only hasten the day when these churches will have to close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had lived nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street – one of Harlem's main merchants – for failing to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused major damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for the reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin’s, proudly declared the carillon to be “the church bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated interaction between architects and contractors, some of whom are hired by the church's lay leadership and others by the diocese.
The Council of Churches – the church’s leadership, consisting of laymen – wrote to the diocese in July about its concern that the diocese would “try to impose the costs” of the Council of Churches, despite the fact that the Council of Churches had not been involved in the initiation of the architects or contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Thirteen-year-old shark injured in California lobster dive
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and that he and a group of others were swimming across to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was screaming with excitement at catching a lobster, but he gradually realized that the boy was shouting 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
His entire collarbone was torn up,” says Hammel, who discovered the injury when he reached the boy.
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Swimmer Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles also said the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its inauguration in the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warehouse-like makeup and beauty care shelves, staffed by specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are being tested out in 11 stores around the country as part of a strong surge in the UK’s 2.8 million beauty market, which is experiencing steady growth as sales figures for clothing and homewares fall. If the attempt turns out to be successful, the concept will be expanded to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is the result of the supermarket’s attempt to find a new use for the space previously used for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s has said it will double the number of beauty products it offers to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the retail chain has never sold before.
Existing product ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees will also have better space in branded areas, just like in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its Boutique make-up brand with mainly vegan products, because there is an increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the other will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
E-commerce and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, has said that sales will eventually look more and more like a department store, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods besides food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to upgrade its beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated after a dispute over the distribution of income from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of beauty shelves to create a more welcoming environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be ready to provide advice and help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the welcoming environment and convenient locations make us a beauty contestant that represents a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones Reveals Holly Willoughby Withdraws From Deal Worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million
Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones is reportedly furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby, 37, who runs This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones furious by stepping down from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last second to focus on her own new gold-edged contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “razzling” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the television star admitted that her new deals – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time to spare for their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK on her way to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security for the next few decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has decided to leave.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was right before the launch.
Now there is a department store full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that are now ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the This Morning programmer, which is among the UK’s most popular stars, could cost the company several million pounds due to large investments in products such as pillows and light, fashion and cowhide, as well as a potential delay of the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-year-old Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin who hosts the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Checkbox Facts “And Then We Fall In Love”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment some would consider “little presidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much away?
said Trump in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I didn’t give anything away.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, having even declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big rubbish on the way to nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “similar response” from the United States to its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the U.S., instead, has continued sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure on.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for an assembly of his constituents.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his work to improve relations with Kim has yielded positive results, such as putting a stop to rocket launchers, helping to release hostages and getting the remains of U.S. servicemen sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the area right in front of him.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami destroys an island and kills hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombok residents had lost their homes, it was not declared a national disaster, which is a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it quite clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging,” Sumbung explained.
Save the Children is now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Emergency Management Unit, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations should be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Considering the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is terribly ill-prepared to deal with nature’s anger.
Lights to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren in Palu, even though a warning had been issued, has likely contributed to the death toll.
Even under the best of circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made upgrading Indonesia’s crumbling infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for Joko’s administration, which is due to stand for re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have transitioned to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late draw in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the match at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before sending it towards the longest corner.
The attempt went high above the box as the ball fell towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually ran over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as best they can, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touched the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it on.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at the break, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker sent a pass with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic came with a quick handover in the midfield.
He then fired off a great breakthrough pass that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the European Men's Football League in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia reaches 832.
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country’s emergency management agency said on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a 7.5-stroke that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from demolished buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation is underway after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with a stab wound at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact them.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan says: “We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I would like to ask everyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to contact them – they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the deceased woman was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said they are working to inform the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats “it’s so terrible” over and over again.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were behind the blockade, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the barracks and supervised the apartment complex.
Individuals with information are asked to send an instant message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, by referring to “log 247” from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial to be pulled into the dispute about "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England’s cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Cricks publishing as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate regarding the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Palace of Westminster would also become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning depiction of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century opinions and is part of the historiography of a man many believe still deserve to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than he is today, as the Parliament’s defender against pressure from outside – in his time, of course, it was about the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.”
Killing pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on his market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, known only by his last name “Yuan”, was found dead and covered in blood from a ruptured artery near a binge in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate to a nearby pork trail was open.
He said that inside the pork trail there was a big mess with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that the 250-pound pig had killed the man.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and maltreated,” the cousin, referred to by his last name Wu, explained in a quote to the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While police collected evidence from the crime scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else.
Yuan's family and market management are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Although the distinction occurs, it is not the first time it has been recorded that a pig has attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts, inflicting serious injuries on the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg pig until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to usual, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, and are very curious ... they are not trying to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.”
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rain in the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is reported to be weakened as it moves across the cooler sea off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rain on her way through northern Mexico and southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane at 05.00 ET on Sunday, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a trough begins to form across the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern United States.
Pink will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical humidity and the approaching trout will lead to widespread heavy rain in the southwest for the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, floating debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep-tropical humidity will lead to precipitation rates of up to 5–7 cm per hour in some areas, particularly areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around the desert on foot as long as there is a risk of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains can cause river valleys to turn into sweeping rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to local winds that may contain dust and sand.
The approaching trough will cause local heavy rainfall for parts of the coastline along Southern California.
Total rainfall above 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid debris and fast, as well as smooth roads.
This will be the area’s first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and continue throughout Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics stay very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of severe temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are likely to have a hot start in October, with degrees high in the twenties from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern U.S.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the eastern United States is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, spread over six television networks, watched Thursday’s gripping testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday’s big surprise last second, when it emerged that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent sure this did not happen.
Friday’s broadcast was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewers were not immediately available to other networks that displayed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring office monitors.
To give a little perspective, this is the watch number that corresponds to the playoffs of the U.S. Football Championship or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose voices have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led among the networks, with average ratings of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was still a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake was the protagonist of Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican’s office made a statement that he would vote in Kavanaugh’s favor. On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras as he tried to take the elevator to a court committee meeting as protesters shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with his eyes lowered for several minutes while being slandered, while the incident was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling our country the truth?”
He was told that “you have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office has made a statement, saying as the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether to continue Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only willing to do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate within the next week, which the Democratic minority has urged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of 'political game' over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused opponents of her plan to leave the EU in order to play “political games” with Britain’s future and undermine the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued her attack on her so-called “Chequers” plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Causing LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with manslaughter, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost their glasses during the basketball game.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner released a preliminary report on Friday, in which the cause of death is listed as a gunshot wound to the head and through the throat.
Police thanked the Louisiana State Police’s task force for collecting refugees, the state’s police laboratory, the Southern University police and the locals for their contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU sports leader Joe Alleva thanked the area’s police force for their “hard work and pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2m tall forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "shocked" after Wayde's death.
“This is what we fear at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano sprays ash over Mexico City
The ash sprouting from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevenci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Desastres, Mexico’s public agency for crisis prevention, warned the people of Mexico on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within a day.
The agency monitored several cases of bullying and shaking.
Pictures on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering windscreens on cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is located 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police, while several thousand attended competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the riot police, bombarding them with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handcuffs also erupted later in the day, as police used batons to limit fighting.
For hours, independence demonstrators stood and shouted “Never forget, never forgive,” face to face with unionist demonstrators shouting “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to local press.
Tensions remain high in the liberation-oriented region a year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming turnout for secession, but it was poor attendance because the vote was boycotted by most opponents of the liberation.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to stop the vote held at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets overnight to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia's possibility of becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy to get a voice, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in last December’s regional elections, parties supporting Catalan independence have struggled to keep the pressure up this year, as many of their well-known leaders have traveled in self-imposed exile or are in custody while awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum and the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used her phone to film the protest to support police, said the conflict is fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been jailed in anticipation of a trial since late last year, announced that he will stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
“To stand for election as a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the repression and regression from democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was repeatedly driven into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livinston was stunned by the Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga proved to be crucial, and Gary Holt’s side is now equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won the away Premier League this season and will play against the leaders of the Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
The Rangers will play their home game against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, has remained undefeated through six games in the division. Head coach Holt has yet to lose a game after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against his lazy guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick forward after slipping in to meet Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for their guests at the dead ball.
And that’s how the ultimate goal came about.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to give Menga a clear path, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage, the Rangers had had the ball pretty much all the time, but the home team's defense had turned out to be impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed an almost score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a wide pass.
Crossings constantly entered the Livingston box and were constantly rescued, while two penalty claims – once after Halkett’s protest against substitute Glenn Middleton, and once by hand – were overlooked.
“Phenomenal” from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The playing style and crew have barely changed since they made it to the top again, but Holt should have much of the credit for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated an enormously well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, did not have my inspiration to share.
Although they have at times been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was laber – they only made it into the home team’s half of the field once – and it was a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan to receive mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiles and blue skies on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the NATO allies.
There have been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security as the reason a crowd of 25,000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protestors, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, criticizing both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Collision: Cyclist Killed in Car Collision
A cyclist is killed in a collision with a passenger car in London.
The collision occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy veil in Deptford in the southeast of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The collision takes place just one month after a cyclist died in an overpass where the driver escaped from the crime scene on Childrens Street, about a mile from Saturday's collision.
Metropolitan Police said police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus stops are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an incident at a high-security men's prison, according to prison authorities.
Riots erupted at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
Specialized Tornado officers are brought in to handle the incident, which involves eight inmates and is limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been sent in to handle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police and may have to spend even more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot police were summoned to deal with a serious incident in which employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be beneficial for drought areas)
It’s the sign Arizona is hit by a tropical low, but that’s likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining force moves through the desert areas of the southwest, bringing flooding danger.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood forecasts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain will start late Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has remarked on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm of individual locations in Mongolian Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of danger of flooding, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the southwestern United States is currently in a dry state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s population experiences at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category,” according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa lands on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind force of 137 km, located 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, thus losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday evening or afternoon.
Precipitation in parts of Mexico can be heavy and cause severe flooding.
“Total rainfall of 7.5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of rainfall,” according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which debris moves on through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected by Rosa or the remnants of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening floods and liquid debris and rapids in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 04:00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital, and his condition is expected to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked anyone who may have a cellular recording of the incident to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suffered under the pettiness and the mind” of the Democratic Party
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered under the pettiness and the mind” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault on her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw how brilliant, skillful and courageous” Kavanaugh was that day.
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, with impeccable public service record,” he told a rally of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president discreetly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lifetime.
I’m not really a participant, but I’m a participant,” he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats wanted to “resist and prevent.”
The Senate’s first midterm vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to an assistant to a Republican leader.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslide and tsunami, numbers expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed and many were pulled out to sea by huge waves pounding against the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slavesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday, when up to six-meter-high waves roared ashore around sunset, destroying everything in its path and dragging many into drowning.
The tsunami hit the heels of an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami struck yesterday, people were still operating on the beach, did not escape immediately and ended up as victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Emergency Management Unit (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami was not alone – it carried cars, logs and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.”
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Emergency Management Authority showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the power of Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be the larger country's coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely clogged, completely without information" from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a press release, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building shouts desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passers-by on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water thunders to the beach, tearing down buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that has hindered communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport is only open for relief work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's absolutely cruel.
World Vision staff from Donggala have safely made their way to downtown Palu, where they have sought shelter under tarpaulin tents in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed major devastation along the way, according to Doseba Sinay.
“They told me they saw hundreds of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's absolutely cruel.
As aid organizations began their grim preparations for emergency relief, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open the borders to international aid, but the situation has not yet received any status.”
As the sun sets over Palu for the second time since Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miraculous stories that illuminate the grim news picture after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was freed by rescue crews after spending two days trapped under ruins with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional shoulder to carry,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes who participated in the beach festival on Palu.
But the messages only led to gray ticks, rather than a couple of blue ticks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 under ATM refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man “runs up behind that Brink’s employee” and steals a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects escape from the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity must contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creation formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she canceled on an "emotional basis," according to the series creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when he discussed the album title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s incoming president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
Military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, an investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements regarding artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, for its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be the number one innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double financial support could double the chance that the next big achievement in artificial intelligence comes from the United States,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat America's best Othello player, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation of smart heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
“It’s not China that’s stealing the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired smart heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have a PhD in Artificial Intelligence should receive offers of residence permits automatically,” he said.
The Chinese government issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other state organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been halted for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia” to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a claim to Greek territory, and has vetoed their inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the turnout will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece?”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Even if it is not legally binding, it will probably be crucial, because a large enough number of MEPs have said they will respect the result of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission has said that they had not received any irregularity reports by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) clarified a small scene and drew out chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the vote.
“We are positive for NATO and the EU, but we will register with a raised head, not be let in the back way,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have ours.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become a member of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He says a “yes” answer would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum – this is lower than the required attendance.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of blacks plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political hurdle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero manoeuvres past Brighton's entire defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling smashed the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2–0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He raced against three Brighton defenders before making it to the open.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before running from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
He was lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball placed inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the dead line.
City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a spoiler for the Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for the playoffs, and have no reason to bet heavily.
The ever-equally competitive Scherzer still hopes to be on the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff opportunities of the Colorado team, which leads the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
The Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Although we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will most likely be the highest level of play I’ll be able to play this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in it?”
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly prone to taking Scherzer's pitch in such a situation.
Sherzser, who is in that case starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president discreetly referred to the situation around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he talked about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not a participant, but I’m a participant. That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates,” he said.
“You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power back at any cost; there you see the smallness and the meanness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to cross to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, aim to "resist and prevent".
“And you see it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “sinful and wicked and ugly and dishonest.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, after which the audience bowed loudly.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I’m expecting one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don’t tolerate people who have their say.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was supposed to be censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On how important it is to have responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe – ironically, similar issues on which they disagreed with former leaders.
On Friday’s Nottingham East Labour meeting, it said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood at many of the meetings, and the promise of “softer, more friendly” politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the workers’ party, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously thought that I shared many political positions with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, whether they were about national security or the EU’s internal market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – I get a ton of nasty messages on social media that demand that I be deposed, condemn center politics and tell me that I shouldn’t be part of the Labour Party.
And it’s not just me who’s experienced this.
I know that I am more fortunate than any of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they face a sea of gender-discriminating and racist comments every day, but never let themselves be stifled.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross stigma has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to all, and every motion of no confidence and every change in the election rules is narrowing the party.
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years where I am encouraged to keep my head down and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better.”
But that’s not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the Thatcher government’s neglect that had led to my classroom at the public school I attended was literally fallible, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have in any way misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the representative proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as the country rages our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of deposition or political uncompromisingness will prevent me from doing what I believe best protects your interests.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the end result slightly, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
They are now at the top of the table, and are the only undefeated of the ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities that led to the home team losing the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be happy.
“We have been challenged in our fights so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy with that,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Honor to Ayr, they were better at taking advantage of opportunities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, with a goal kick from Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to level the position, and Jason Baggot performed an attempt without a goal kick.
Climo reinforced Ayr's leadership with a penalty kick before, just before the break, scoring and goal kicking a solo attempt to change the position to 17–5 on break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a goal kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This resulted in a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on a stretcher, and from the restart, Ayr's management increased even further an attempt by Stafford McDowell, with a goal kick from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the field to the fullest with an attempt by Bruce Colvine without a goal kick, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the innings behind the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo made a goal kick, as he did again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth attempt.
The Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It looks like Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the catering industry – it was recently discovered that he is named as the CEO of a gifted restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, for which he writes and plays with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The dove has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public listings, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "living restaurant business".
“The ocean is ours”: Bolivia, a country without a coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling a rig-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a navy blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.”
The entire inland state of Bolivia is still fresh in memory of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, and the country longs to once again be able to sail in the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for decades, with Bolivia awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the drive, the spirit of community and peace of mind, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on the big screen in many different places in the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will give its ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after decades of occasional negotiations – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also staked heavily on Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to take Bolivia’s side, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The U.N. body, whose team is in the Netherlands, has no authority that allows them to give away Chilean lands, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” according to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than advancing Bolivia’s cause, the last four years may actually have made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She believes that Morales’ antagonistic rhetoric has wiped out any remaining benevolence on Chile’s side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations on some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's ruling came unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will provide “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “put an end to 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – has used the maritime situation as a political hideout.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“The ruling is an opportunity to see what we need to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen unless they can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not rely on US authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during a meeting between the two opposing leaders in Singapore.
The comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to launch the locked-in nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a “desirable dream” that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
U.S. officials are skeptical of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to let go of an arsenal the country probably sees as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge headwear, which is heading towards a clothing store near you
If you want some great additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don’t have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of odd, oversized headwear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motel lions at the Paris fashion show.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most striking garment was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a feather-like wide brake that drowned the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a magician's hat, or even a pineapple, but they're not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had reworked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation was reminiscent of diving gear, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you’re looking for even more great fashion accessories, then you’re in luck.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be heading towards a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right in the heels of La Bomba, the straw hat with a half-meter-wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the swimsuit model that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, bordered with raffia fringes and complemented by a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris fashion show.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – once the designer has had such an impact it will be difficult to overlook the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland’s health schools are constantly exhibiting academic excellence, and this has persisted in 2018 with another year of outstanding graduation results. These are supported by individual and joint success in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the very best school experience for both students and parents.
Health schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern language is constantly a popular and in demand choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the words reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest pass rates from free schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received the A grade.
The data, obtained from 74 member schools of the Board of Trustees, showed that 72 per cent of students received the A grade in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received the A grade.
This illustrates that fresh schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subject choices are now valued at the same level as subjects such as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics on the curriculum for freelance schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for the reasons employers cited for having problems occupying a vacancy, 17 percent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will provide real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investing in language learning is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered most valuable to the UK on the way to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be a choice of languages to choose from at health schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish fresh schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that language is constantly crucial to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as “international communication capabilities”.
Health schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and distinction to Scotland’s youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is still unclear.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career,” he said.
Time for Trump's People's Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President starts a series of electoral meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five scheduled meetings over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his elected Supreme Court nominee is on hold, Trump aims to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress as voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump’s West Virginia People’s Meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. An expected confirmation vote is set to wait for up to a week as the FBI investigates the case.
With the main goal of all these rallies is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has said these five public meetings over the next few weeks are aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move towards a busy campaign season,” a campaign spokesman for Trump told Reuters.
The evening's rally, scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and covered by the Pittsburgh press," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost to the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political science expert at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been exactly what this year’s Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum swinging pendulum is a completely fictional sports concept, yet something players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
“They led by six points and now there are four, so we’re probably carrying it with us as a bit of momentum,” Spieth said as he left the field for the day.
Europe will of course have the advantage – they lead with four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, Americans feel like they’ve got some wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent gaming from tee to green, leading by example.
The deep celebration screams grew louder as his round continued, and sank to a decisive putting to raise the match to tie when he and Thomas were two under two.
His putting, which won them the match at 15, was met with a similar scream – of the sort that shows that he still doesn’t believe the American team is unlucky.
“We really just have to put all the cloths on and focus on our own match,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly Ryder Cup’s great success story.
Europe’s unusual but lovely couples have four out of four and don’t set a foot wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair to avoid a bogey on Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday’s biggest competitors, and there are no other players the audience would rather see secure a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in each hole.
It is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily hooked up with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourballs hero, when he was partnering with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede were so far behind that they had no chance to regain the lead.
On Sunday, there is no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is well ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the spirit of some, especially in the United States, have been missing.
Europe leads 10–6 at the start of last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing Sunday’s fourballs and foursomes matches with 10–6 lead against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led by two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, raising their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's European side, struggling to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning fourballs and won the series 3–1.
The United States gave more resistance in the foursomes and won two games, but they did not regain any of the lead.
Jim Furyk’s side must collect eight points from Sunday’s 12 singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – together nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only pair to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they worked seamlessly to beat broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more expressive 5&4.
Woods, who slipped through two games on Saturday, blinked occasionally, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevens in the foursomes and performed a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe did not get everything the way they wanted on this hot day with a light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for Americans by two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fought 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team managed to catch up after a four-point lead at the start of the singles game, but as current holders only need Furyk's side to score a draw to keep the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, they don’t seem to be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will “in no way” agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions had heightened distrust of the United States and that the country would in no way agree to unilaterally drop its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has implemented “significant benevolent measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not seen any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, rewarding North Korea for gradual steps in disarmament, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on June 12, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim vowed to work against “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula”, while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first let go of its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first,' lifting pressure via sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even opposes 'the declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can get us down on our knees is a dream come true for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader stressed before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If the other party in this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as entrenched as it is.”
However, the tone of Rice’s speech was very different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland U.S. with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the United Nations this year praising Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said much work remains, and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear-weaponized.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he didn’t have a time frame for this, saying that “It doesn’t matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must still be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, saying afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had made progress, but only hours after North Korea accused him of making "gangsterous demands".
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile site as well as a nuclear weapons facility if the United States took “similar measures.”
He said Kim had said that these “equivalent measures” he wants were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Courses in Getting Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by tackling the growing unculture of puking through the night with caffeinated beverages as fuel.
One academic found that students at the world’s best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the lecture, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why hasn’t anyone said this before?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to students the importance of good sleep habits in order to be able to perform academically and athletically, and for the general condition.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health care at the university, said the university decided to start the course after seeing the students suffer from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this is not going to change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know about this, just as you have a right to know about the risks of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to puggle all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
Enough sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the professor’s classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course inspired him to work for a course that was available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master students to take a similar study program before enrolling at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students put on an alarm for when to go to bed as well as when to get up and that they had to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED lights. This type of light can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another away loss when Dolly Menga's goal defeated Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted their first win since February's 4–1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager and left behind his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to equalize.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble in fermentation for the Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown from a away audience.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, sweeping past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy with how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
The Rangers probably had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the goalpost.
The Rangers took control, but it looked like their game leaned more on hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he would have a penalty kick after 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson declined.
The Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opening in the 34th minute may have been against the game’s pace, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep game from the Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he selected Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player change gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the kind of fight they liked, as Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the final, but McGregor stood up to Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late penalty kick claim as he came into conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the “Sunday Morning” almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science ever since, and also became a part of popular culture through the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a geyser counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Let’s say it makes a sound now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, and are then injected into the patient again.
A vaccine under trial has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered from disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then these cells are injected into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of different types of cancer,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar procedure, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and “trained” to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came up with a fierce defense of Trump after the SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was curled up in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a staggering performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he extended out against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judiciary Committee of allegations of sexual assault presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he heard it in the back room about the choice of headgear.
“They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they said I don’t understand what reality is,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see that I understand what reality is?” he said, saying that he was going to “put on my Superman cape, because then no one can tell what to do.
Try love.”
His comments were curled up at least twice, and the staff working at SNL looked embarrassed, Variety reported, where one staff member said: "The whole studio was put to death."
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: Thank you for standing up to the masses.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is “just who he is and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’ that I believe cultivates and spews out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on he was "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper colleague Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, so it is, of course, the late music legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbing a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The case will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington extends to 'gifistic masculinity'
Kit Harington is known from the role of sword swinger Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on film often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of “toxic masculinity” in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was very concerned about the topic.
“It worries me a lot at the moment – where did masculinity go wrong?” he said.
“How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may be partly to blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the highly masculine roles.
He continued: “What is innate and what is attested?
What is being conveyed on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate this very side of being a man?
I think that’s one of the really big questions of our time – how can we change that?
“Something has gone wrong for young people.”
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any precursor or successor to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is “finished with battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so something good came out of it — my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, the health representative said.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the infection is due to inadequate protection by sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised public access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters Rejects Employee Leaked Data on Republican Senators, Sniffs of ‘Dangerous Lies’ and ‘Conspiracy Theories’
House member Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that members of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured by the allegations was made by “ultra-conservative” commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the assault charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and a regular lie,” Waters continued.
“The members of my staff – who have had their identities, personal information and security compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations – had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a regular lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, among others by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is aggressive,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They must not go into defense.
You must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to act calmly and calmly.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the midterms, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Big – if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified “relevant authorities and police of these false allegations.”
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – Bloodthirsty Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit hints in every new film with a British twist and it seems to be relevant to this revival of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurrected in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfaction about how obviously hopeless we are to become the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bubbling eyes and the rubber visor has been renewed his license to mess it up for the second time – his name says more than anything that he is a clear and comic figure destined for territories with non-English speaking cinema audiences.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a can of Mr Bean, and a portion of that guy who contributes a single note to the fire truck theme music hit during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long-forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's one great moment in the recent Johnny English journey.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades cut his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy comes to his senses, but the humor feels rather bloodthirsty and strangely redundant, especially now that the “serious” brands like 007 and Mission Impossible have elements of comedy willingly removed.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and to me, Johnny English’s fades are not as inventive and pointed as the muffled film loops in Mr Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the dismay of the guarding agent – a deplorable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a prime minister, a pompous and downtrodden figure already undergoing a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this sort of-Teresa-May role, but the script doesn’t give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she has to bring in someone from among the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobby establishment, but gives unofficial instruction in secret intelligence. There are some funny sequences here, when English offers a rock academy for spying activity.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, split with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class lady role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin style of messing everything up on a mission for the queen is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's fantastic femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s cyber problems: the insidious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey with farcical side jumps: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English unleashes the sheer anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so gracious and noisy it is so there is a lot that reminds of children's TV with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he can really use his talent?
Labour denies plans to allow Britons to work four-day week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will give the British a four-day working week – but get paid for five.
The party apparently wants business leaders to spend savings on the artificial intelligence revolution by giving workers an extra day off.
This will result in the employees getting a three-day weekend, while receiving the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to a four-day week so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to let the pendulum swing to the benefit of the workers – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day week during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day week is not the party’s policy, and is not something that is considered by the party.”
Labour’s financial policy spokesman, John McDonnell, used the Labour conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless executives” and “profiteers” of public service providers.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not getting back the entire stock because a Labour government can make “deductions” based on perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and set up employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private sector companies to the employees, who can receive an annual dividend of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' about FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could cause them to change their minds
The FBI’s review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview sent out on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the opening of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, confident, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, appears to have been carved into stone.
“I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and if so, it must be a startling finding,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett vigorously denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change that.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to combating poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicate the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will get thousands of people to stream to the vast lawn of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness around the event’s real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a variety of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, taking a phone call, or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness around their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called “clickivism” – that people feel they are making a big contribution by signing a signature campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from supporters, with a wealth of different goals.
They say these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was able to show 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and entrepreneurs that will “help children to unlock their full potential,” and pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists performing at this year’s event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can “if necessary” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
“Through the Navy, the U.S. has the ability to make sure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blockades to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that is profiling itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, noting that they are far along the same path.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one trick pony” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
Trump administration officials, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project The Northern European Gas Pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Northern European gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, which is to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of fraudulent competition.
"I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has met with resistance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the BDI, has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have big problems with third countries interfering in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of the BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “think seriously” about her 2020 presidential nomination, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “consider seriously” whether she would run for president after the midterm elections.
During an election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would stand down.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix the chess-driven government, and that includes a woman on top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to run for president.”
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m concerned right up to the margins about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before a vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not remain silent, according to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported his candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's voter turnout
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after enlisting in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after coming home, I have in common with other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerabilities our soldiers bring with them,” she told the audience at an election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans: “They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their soldier comrades and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, rubbing a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla police.
18 states and D.C. support testing new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented an orientation from amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal police has not been made public.
She claimed that the partner “and his violent gang members’ sons” abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Court that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores many decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle,” the amicus curiae said.
The lawyers further argued in the briefing that the policy that denied immigrants access harms the U.S. economy and say there is a high probability that they will become entrepreneurs and “contribute with the necessary labor.”
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political view,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu – death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It was very exciting,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the bustling city of Palu.
“You see ambulances picking up the dead.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents could be seen coming to broken homes and looking through water-damaged possessions in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sit outside Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing heavy aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes as he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to be safe.
I was crushed by the wall that collapsed, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Treasure’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper depicting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the appendix China Daily paid to enter the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. officials said.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s early-trade tariffs were expected to hit export companies in states such as Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader’s post in Sunday’s Des Moines Register: “China is now escalating the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities are taking advantage of the freedom of speech and the open press that we enjoy in America to place a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing, you won’t find many divergent opinions and won’t experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese about China’s troubled economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers declined to publish” his article, although he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh fade, analysts warn
With many top Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received multiple allegations of sexual assault against him, analysts warn they will face a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The sentiments around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)’s proposal for an FBI investigation at the last second will be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget yesterday’s events – they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the hallways of the Senate when the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already been high, that’s true.
But it could have been higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president.
Even before Ford’s public testimony gave a detailed description of the charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts thought it would be a counter-reaction if Republicans forced through the appointment.
“This has become a blissful mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), said early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final approval or Kavanaugh’s inauguration – it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that promotes the election of democratic candidates, told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe in the wake of Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents were completely or quite convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh’s production.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh was lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following the Flake outburst, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh, in a drunken state, abused her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals to her while at a party during her time at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
At Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data warehouse online” or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, work lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data storage online is that it is up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it “personal authorization through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide resources, process and relevant expertise to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers on contract to work on the project, and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which will cause their business models to be completely redesigned overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupts’ “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.

Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross Recipient of World War I
The only priest in the Church of England who was awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann was awarded the honour on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was unearthed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said there was a “great symbolism” that the stone was to be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he crashed into the firing line and led the line "with great courage" forward before storming a field cannon on his own and striking out three of the divisions.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he “felt very honored to play a role in the parade,” adding: “The bravery of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people.”
MMA fans were up all night to watch the Bellator 206 martial arts program, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine you’ve stayed awake all night to see the tight-packed Bellator 206, only to discover that you won’t see the main game.
The San Jose contestant made it through 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, viewers in the UK sat moaning as the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to watch the game.
A supporter on Twitter described the transition to the children’s program as “a kind of sick joke.”
“It is state regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programs at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will be working on the broadcast plan to include viewers in Britain in the future.
“I think we can figure it out for the rematch,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we won’t be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me - when we put it over, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly sort.
We tried to fix it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn’t, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five games – which we usually broadcast – and we tried to stretch far for the fans, but tipped over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior in terms of sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn’t until high school that he realized “he wasn’t like others.”
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he stood up for the rights of the gays to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the traditional program, Kirsty Young, is due to be gone for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared a little lost on Laverne's first broadcast and said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, it is these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time Olympic bronze medalist and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador. He used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels he is lucky that he can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he attended his first Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had been changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about me winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London 2012 – since he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew this was what I’d dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of a home crowd during the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud of Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the run-up to the Olympics and still gives him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formsweake Mickelson taken out for the Ryder Cup golf tournament Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to get in shape if it's not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for an impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he had so often been for the United States, the five-time major winner divides the day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the ranks in hopes of rectifying what’s messy.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the peak of his career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough area constantly punishes misguided battles.
And if the track itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 singles games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s bets may prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in her husband, not that he could say anything else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible assets to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, and he likes to have sex with others. He’s a great guy to have in the storage room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week, too, and it was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows his great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant lead at the entrance to the last-day singles game in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but won with the least margin possible, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You constantly remind yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only barely,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on that team that this is not over.
You will give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that is where the focus is.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn is very pleased with the way his players have done on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t have done better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it is the individual achievements that are at the center, and it is something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, your achievements as a golfer are tested to the fullest.
It is the message that you have to convey to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he has to go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the major upheavals on the last day. He was on the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed the "miracle at Medinah".
I remember every damn word of it,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had ravaged his players at the entrance to the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, which we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to move in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle battles.
We arrange our setup accordingly and send people out the way we feel. You know, we’re trying to create something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the top half of the game order.
“I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said of his choice of singles players.
Germany's new warship delayed once again
The latest German navy frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it won’t happen until early next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the “Rhineland-Palatinate”, the ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class navy ordered back in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen-class.
It has been agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from home port.
Constant delays mean, however, that the advanced warships – which were said to give Germany strength at sea – will already be outdated by the time they are put into service, Die Zeit reports.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors – only half of the crew of older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also discovered that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces performance and limits the Navy's ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including training of the crew – has also started to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government's defense committee, confirmed that the navy is in fact "empty for usable ships".
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships were destroyed, but no new vessels arrived.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be used by the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
New research conducted at a land estate in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help design future conservation measures.
The study for researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brown and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and which species do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will be included in the decision on what measures should be introduced, such as the setting up of grazing grounds and how best to take care of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects breeding grounds and habitat restriction.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attacks from house cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road as they fly.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out surveys, mapping breeding sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at Threeave land in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave we have a perfect area for bats,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of mapping the bats before maintenance is carried out on a property since the unintentional destruction of a single breeding ground can kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps outlaw an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help in the work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we simply don’t know how the populations are doing.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges While Lawyers Will Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as “fake news” and says people “want fame” by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375,000 in retaliation for keeping the incident under wraps, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo dismissed the charges as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” says five times the winner of the Golden Ball into the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's normal.
They want fame by giving my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," added the footballer with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called “an unacceptable display of suspicion in the private sphere,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz says the footballer will claim compensation for “injury to the extent of the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% a good man" who was betrayed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in hospital, but later they entered into settlements outside the court because she was "afraid of revenge" and was also concerned about "being publicly hanged".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to set aside the settlement because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged abuse, moving this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain ‘will mourn forever’ over loss of car makers
Britain “will mourn forever” if it loses its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily halt production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delayed border crossings in the event of a no-deal Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, in my opinion, we will see production at our factory stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other British manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether what automakers say is supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of “order as needed” and it arrives parts every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be stays at the border, which industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than one day of inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further ties with the EU is “precisely geared to avoid such border controls.”
“We need to have an agreement. We want to have the best deal that makes us, as I say, not only enjoy success at the moment, but that we seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that increased costs in the long term would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually result in the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union leader at the factory, said that the members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience indicates that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s fateful meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” as the fight around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible impediments to the president’s non-execution.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the deputy justice minister or not, threatening Mueller’s independence, has been raging for months during speculation in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking up talks with Trump and attempting to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to retire voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he “preferably would not” fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set. It could be this week, but I realized it could be a week’s delay because of everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always keen to keep the press up-to-date.”
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Programmer Chris Wallace asked about the reason.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to reluctance to “self-righteousness” of TV reporters, though she added: “I don’t disagree that they are self-righteous.”
She then suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will become more frequent.
“The president is doing more rounds than any previous president,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press gets a chance to question the president of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We’re trying to get it done often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often in the last few weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences when visiting key figures.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, as he made a solo run and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS (State Health Service) to express the country’s gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have taken place throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution by the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of each individual employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, add valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of healthcare for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the first half was over.
“He came out on the sideline and sort of just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is no information about the type/scale of the damage yet” and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transitioning from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before finishing the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. Under new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters
The document fee increase will be collected from those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in the UK – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters with a promise to offer more affordable housing and frame high-income groups.
The document fee increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will strengthen the government’s efforts to remedy the homeless situation.
The profit – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago for second home and rental home purchases – can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to contribute up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the UK. This drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” due to the many foreign buyers who mostly reside outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the document fee to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused major construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing policy.”
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a startling array of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unfounded evictions.
He also wants to give city councils more power to build new homes.
“Last year I said I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For many people the dream of owning their own home has become far too distant, and the unworthy situation of the homeless persists.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I got a B-cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there’s always something that pulls me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I succeeded in the club’s merger.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League."
From the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League," he said.
It’s not an easy task to get it there, but I’ll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month brief appearance on the Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to recover from relegation to the Third Division and helped St Mirren from the brink of relegation to win the championship title the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real difference,” he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, created a reasonable income from it and experienced some nice highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I am progressing through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but the management feels absolutely right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable thing I’ve known all my adult life.”

Perfect time for a pint is 17.30 on Saturdays, survey shows
This summer’s heatwave has boosted revenues for Britain’s hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw a revenue increase of 2.7% in July – while restaurant revenues fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who summarized the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long participation in the World Cup, July followed a pattern similar to the previous month of June, when pubs rose 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The drop of 1.8% in restaurant turnover in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger just-for-equal than that of restaurants went down.
Pubs with food service also had a hard time with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6.6% that month, with food service decreasing by 3%.”
Paul Newman, RSM hotel and restaurant analyst, said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting and social events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales on the outdoor market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a 4.8% year-on-year sales drop will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide a long-awaited breathing space.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in new brand rollouts.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK’s industry turnover controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors, collects and analyzes the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some are only 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers, research shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students uncovered pages of “fake Insta.”
The news has heightened concerns that sexual content is being shared.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they show to their parents.
One in five children – some are only 11 years old – create social media accounts that they keep hidden from the adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found rapid growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to photo-sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has heightened concerns about sexual content being shared.
20% of students said they had an innocent “main account” that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ Conference (HMC) for Private Schools, revealed that 40% of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s frightening that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘Voice of Athletes’ on Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her extensive experience at international level over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide athletic community, and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to serve as a voice for athletes and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guiding the sport in Scotland.”
The American won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and has a total of four Olympic gold medals. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after having a transient ischemic attack, she was unable to walk.
She tweeted: “A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I want to be restored and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m completely fine again and have learned to walk again, and today I’m doing agile exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows splits opinion online
A breast pump company has divided online opinion with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump worn tightly to the body,” Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, released a fresh and flirtatious music video-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to a song with the following lyrics: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see a tail” and “In case you didn’t realize it, this isn’t jurassic, it’s my tits”.
The choir continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bowls.”
However, the ad, which is published on the company’s Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many say it beautifully paints the “cruelties” of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth.”

Another commented: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “What a failed ad.”
Others defend the ad. One woman admitted that she finds the song “incredibly funny.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product,” one of the authors wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits nicely into a nursing bra, allowing women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the spotlight on breast pumping and all the challenges, while showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in secret
The number of migrant children arrested has skyrocketed even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have been afraid to ruin their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people seeking to be supportive of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of the people who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people,” says Albence.
The officers are trying to deal with the children faster and introduced new rules that require some of them to meet in court within one month of being arrested, and not 60 days that were the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be presented via video conferencing instead of appearing in person to bring their residence permit case to an immigration judge.
Those who are considered to be ineligible asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of developing anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have appeared in the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who struggle more easily are overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “occupation powers” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces remained illegally on Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions more are fleeing.
“Damascus will continue to carry out this holy struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories,” he said, “both for terrorist groups and foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said conditions are so good that they can return, accusing “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational flight” that causes the refugees to stay away.
“We have turned to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing what is really a purely humanitarian situation.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the rebels' latest major defence post at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem made conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee and said the panel’s work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win another term
According to that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are likely hoping, impeachment and scandal put an end to the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly have been “the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of visual fatigue.
Since 2014, best-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on nights of major news issues.
“This is a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand anything,” said Neal Baer, the host of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him to vote for Trump.
Why, she asked.
He said, “Because he makes me laugh.”
There is an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Exit is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened person when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of “deep in background fabric” for the book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s leather jacket with ostrich feathers worth $15,000 (“a garment full of color, full of hybris,” said the Washington Post.
I don’t want to see Super Mario the same way anymore.
“Some of what he does that makes it look like a reality show is he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s show’s varying cast and daily twist on the plot.
You can't miss one episode, or you'll be hooked.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27 °C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he caged himself in and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t break free, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the U.S. Supreme Court is at stake.
“I remember when we made all the crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the smoothest midterm elections of the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th District is experiencing a stream of money after a reshuffle of a congressional district that ended up with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly relocated suburban district of Pittsburg sits with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb is facing another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania’s 12th district, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was retracted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were an unconstitutional manipulation of constituencies in favor of Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign funding between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a closely-followed supplementary election for Pennsylvania's 18th District to Congress in March last year.
That seat would have been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little leadership.
U.S. Considers El Salvador Penalties for Supporting China, Then Pulls Threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners ejected the leadership team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed punitive measures, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
While internal meetings were being held, North American and Central American officials postponed a top-level conference that focused on security and economic growth to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which halted all plans for punitive measures against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomat said.
And the three U.S. envoys calmly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harsh messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next nail in the coffin could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible impediment to law enforcement, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly expanding the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in meddling in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, amid preparations to meet voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I don’t mean to claim that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be choices made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had risen up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in severe weather since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret interrogations of the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times's portrayal is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recently launched FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible abuse charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote during the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, because of the experience I got in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light sabbatical lights on the table with the chin cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season in the 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get bigger things done.
“It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game and thought we could do something and we got one point.
Maybe we could have nodded at the end, but a tie was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday is going to be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home crowd in the back, I am sure we can stand by and get a positive result.
"Last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the guys are having fun; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand by now, put the last season behind us and get it done.”
Women lose sleep due to fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the children about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they don’t do anything to take that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t say what you want in advance.
Discuss with the counselor and the family where and how the care should be given. Such choices can have a great impact in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for your expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Get rid of legal problems right away.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to keep track of your medical care, and making sure that health professionals will comply with your wishes should you be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the details in a summary so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications do you need?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have that overview in place.”
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was on his way home after a night out.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an “unmotivated act.”
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have sought witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The communication is out of order, and rescue workers have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region below the provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of Sulawesi's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Aceh regency of Pidie Jaya, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the ravages of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquake hits Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok and kills more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused several thousand tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, smashing a report of domestic violence and opposing arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska state police.
According to the police report, he allegedly took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su Detention Prison and is being arrested for an unsecured debt of $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, absolutely" when asked how he stood on the guilt issue, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being brought in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, wrestling with the domestic violence report and possession of a gun while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just off central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as the tsunami pounded inwards the beach.
Federal Prosecutors Rarely Seek Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he stabbed pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov “deliberately” killed the eight victims and caused serious bodily harm intentionally, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for the possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury dropped the 22-point count, including eight counts of money-grabbing murder, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and vehicle wreckage.
The attack required “significant planning and intention,” the prosecutor said, describing the way Saipov carried out it as “abominable, cruel and corrupt.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, property and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the notice states of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a case that could result in the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no regrets in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile, according to the prosecution.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s publicly-appointed defenders, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a demonstration during the Tory Conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he be held responsible for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain “would have been eradicated” now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been underscored by the pro-Remain Tories who participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she will continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the setback – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Bone told the Solihull protesters that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I want to stand up for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit plan.”
When explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: “I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular with the general public. The opposition is not going to vote for it. It is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are in fact the ones who trash the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Reject the Brexit plan and start listening".
In a direct message to May, she added: “State ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians would “feel the pressure” if they thought about betraying the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“This is about the trust between us – the people – and that politician,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to let them know they’re not going to get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before having a two-hour political rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis taunted the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the start of the conference.
“These are the people telling us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat was talking about the future at a town hall meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the vice chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation about whether she will run against Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the town hall format since Trump became president.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to come to Washington to fix our flawed government, and that includes a woman on top.”
Arrested after LSU Sims Killed in Shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, carrying weapons, and confessed to shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without charge and placed in custody by East Baton Rouge Parish police.
Sims was a two-meter-high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims for the World Championship after stall orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes’ stall orders would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas got a good start and swept almost Hamilton off the field while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue driving in the rear of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some push with the wheels which reluctantly left the Ferrari driver inside free after a double pass to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in as No. 7 at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race while lying on the reels to try to get a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen who lay at number four.
He finally made it through the depot on the 44th round, but failed to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good two-team,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people are “malicious, horrible and speaking falsely.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s been going on in the last days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and mean and awful and speaking falsely,” he said.
“When you look at extraditions and leaks, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn’t do it.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer... you leaked the document – “oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t leak.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked ... no, we didn’t leak,” he added, imitating the senator’s voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.”
But her denial was not graciously addressed by the president, who commented during the party event Saturday night: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to regain power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overtake to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got a two-goal lead early on via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie settled for the home team before Dwyer restored the management of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefes' men, who had come back after beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford finished the game when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to the Cownie's draw at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the lead by break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard equalised once again with a championship goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time during the game late in the second half, and he secured the win with the team's five out in the final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure hundreds of air passengers escape earthquakes
A flight attendant in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after his death and ensured that a plane that had many hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after his colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway just then, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved many hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard it,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, and the country’s disaster preparedness agency reports limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The numbers are expected to rise further since many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the body’s spokesman.
Up to six-metre-high waves have wrecked Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “You see ambulances picking up the dead all the time.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working feverishly to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Reports Missing Man After Plane Crashes in Lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, Micronesia, now says that one man is missing. They previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday afternoon, there was one male passenger they had no record of.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for further details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and their condition was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just off the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a pier also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered aircraft in the past twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts set the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed the proceedings on Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from multiple mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to what he had claimed earlier, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness box on Saturday and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford’s trailer that night, Sanford said he “lied because my trailer was in Nashville.”
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints suggest that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details, and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be left to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is community-engaged hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make community-engaged hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York babysitter sues couples for dismissal after 'racist' message
A New York babysitter sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother, who complained that she was “still a black person”.
The couple denies they are racist, and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up for the first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEII ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistake, it was an “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman who resigned Maurice, claiming that their resigned babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demanding compensation in the amount of $350 per day for the six-month, lodge-based scheme she was promised, but without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don’t do that,” she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned against accusations that they are racist and say the dismissal of Maurice was the only right thing to do, as they did not feel they could trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.”
Plasco’s comparison of the lawsuit to “extortion” was due to his wife’s only two months to term and was in a “very difficult situation.”
Is there such a person you want to punish?
It’s not very nice,” added the stockbroker.
As the legal case progresses, the People’s Court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington's publisher feared readers would not accept a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to sit in someone else’s place when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to know what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a small teddy bear, would have been very happy that his work had been refused. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "bitter sweet" after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important family member" and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
“He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn’t a bragging person,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child doing a feat: you’re proud of it even though it’s not really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Even though it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
Upon landing, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say it looked bad, that he didn’t think she would survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the phone from Nad saying she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make the heart beat, slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t cry and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who were unaware of the trials she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she says.
“I looked down all the time and the tears flowed in a steady stream.
It’s hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards with mourning women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers the folk can call for help.
Sharon’s son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and died when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to experience what I have to relive every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him with a smile.
They said that his smile could light up any room.”
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he died.
Sharon says: “I’m constantly worried that there will be an infectious effect.”
Sharon made the cards “to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit for yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, her partner through 15, not long after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he felt down or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed the altered mood.
On Christmas Day he was completely in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas presents, they didn’t get eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a big trauma for them, but they have to fight through it: “It’s tearing up a big hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we all have to stand up and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin wire as FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get something he asked for — a time-bound investigation — maybe we could get some agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “fall apart” along locked party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 – if Republicans are likely to do poorly, it will be significantly harder for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators and lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI delivers its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and have him incarcerated in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'fall' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea’s Department of Homeland Security, said there had been 1,127 skips last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices for human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most defectors from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China considers the defectors as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them by force.
The relationship between North and South – which is technically still at war – has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks on the lockdown of denuclearization talks.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no possibility that we will unilaterally arm ourselves first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is unfit to sit in Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidacy Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost yelling and crying as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a “grote and coordinated character murder” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony shows he can't sit in the Supreme Court because it shows he's biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would attempt to impeach Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s sitting in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the interrogation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overrule certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
There is a just anger, months and years when the mind takes over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that strange, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You think maybe I’m sad because I’m crying.
I am angry.”
And then she just continued.
And I thought it was amazing.”
Tears are allowed as outlets of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs was in a male-dominated office. I started crying with inexplicable rage and was caught in the neck collar of an older woman – a cool boss that I had always been a little afraid of – who took me to a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry and happy because they managed to take you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he ran for president.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be cheating on his spouse aboard a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought there was nothing in the way of investigating the possibilities of running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was one more.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since it was nearing the end of the campaign, she lagged behind with the funding and swore that she wouldn’t stand down if she didn’t get in $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount, eh?” she asks.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive in money and reach voters instead of delegates, as well as anger over sexism — that she collapsed into tears.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press referred to her.
“You would think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking maybe what they would write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening ointments in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the fight is far from over, a rift between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The main escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, meaning duties on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, retaliated every time, now with a five to ten percent surcharge on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match U.S. attacks for attacks, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to raise the white flag at first.
Making Washington step down means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States will be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can provide a positive tally for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic turmoil in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have realized in the past,” said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to restore the country, which has been devastated after more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now simplified for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries supporting the uprising would not be accepted.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of the Danish team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during much of the tournament, avoided his tee-strokes in the water at par-3 16th hole, and had to be beaten by Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all his rounds and became one of four golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind them, Spain’s Sergio Garcia became the tournament’s most successful Europeans of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I am very, very happy to get the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I could help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the relay pin to his compatriot John Ram, who beat U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely in his upbringing,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing feat for his squad, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves away.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten.”
