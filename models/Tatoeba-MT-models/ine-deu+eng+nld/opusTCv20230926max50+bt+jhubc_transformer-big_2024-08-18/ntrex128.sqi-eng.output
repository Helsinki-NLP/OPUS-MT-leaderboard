Members of the Welsh Assembly worried that they "look like fools"
Among some of the members of the Assembly has spread a concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This has come as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
Members of the Assembly from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this could spark ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said his group was concerned "that this rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "stupid" and pwp means "stupid".
A Welsh MP said the whole group was "displeased" and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budalla".
In this context, the expression of the "w" germ in Welsh is similar to that of the "u" germ in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to announce the name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on the appointment of the Members of the Assembly will be up to the members themselves."
The Welsh Government's 2017 law gave the Welsh Assembly the tag to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation, and the latter's proposal for naming the assembly as the "Parliament of Wales" found broad support.
Regarding the issue of the title of Assembly Members, the Commission favoured the appointment of "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMP", but the alternative "MWP" found more support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are apparently suggesting alternative choices, but the fight for consensus could turn into a squabble for President Elin Jones, who is expected to table legislation on changes within weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules for the exclusion of Members of the Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
During the discussion of the legislation, the final vote on the issue of their appointment will remain with the Members of the Assembly.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was set in an attempt to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia itself.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim over its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, has said he will not recognize the votes.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells fall silent as churches in Harlem struggle
"Historically, the elderly people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church at every turn," Adams said.
"They're both missing today."
He said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"These days, people socialize in other ways," he says.
"Bars are no longer the meeting point of the neighborhood, where people go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of properties will not last as long as the leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that the churches could be replaced by mansions full of such people that they would not support the sacred sites that have remained in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy living quarters in these palaces are white," he said, "so the day will soon come when these churches close down well, as it's a pity that most of the people who settle in these apartments become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of people of color - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Congregation of White Methodists was transferred in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a congregation of people of color, who had their place of worship nearby.
St. Martin passed a congregation of black people under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's clergymen made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the carnival.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the career "poor people's chambers."
The expert who played in his career in July called it something else entirely: "a cultural treasure" and a "historical instrument irreplaceable."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also stated that this was the first career in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a bigger career at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin had not replaced him.
The events of recent months in St. Martin have been a complicated confession of architects and contractors, some sent by lay church leaders and others from the episcopal diocese.
The council - the leading body of the church, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July, with concern that it would "try to transfer the costs" to the church council, despite the latter not being involved in the hiring of architects and contractors.
Some clergymen complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old During Diving to Catch Crab in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving to catch crabs in California on the day of the crab season's opening, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then drove toward him along with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought the boy was just excited by catching some crab, but then "I figured he was screaming 'He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel states that when he reached the boy, he saw that his entire keyboard was torn.
"They all cried out to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the children's hospital "Rady's" in San Diego, where he was declared in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coastguard captain Larry Giles said at a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago but had been identified as a non-hazardous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Officials banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic pavilions of the style of large stores, with a staff of specialized retailers.
Within the framework of a considerable effort to enter the UK cosmetics market of 2.8 billion pounds, which is continuing to grow as sales of fashion clothes and household items are declining, the largest cosmetics stores in the UK and the largest in the world will be tested.
The investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelving spaces that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Even existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with dedicated areas for the respective brands, similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
Also, the supermarket will re-launch its boutique cosmetics line, so that most of the products are vegan ingredients - something that is increasingly being sought after by younger buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop retailer will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, while a second is expected to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and a trend towards daily shopping for food in small quantities in the neighborhood stores mean that now supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, has said outlets will start to look more and more like large stores, as the supermarket network tries to combat Aldi's and Lidl's price cuts with more services and products.
Sainsbury's has placed "Argos" outlets in hundreds of stores and introduced a range of "Habitats" that after buying both networks two years ago, which it said spurred sales of food products and made their purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments has resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a merger with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger disintegrated after a debate over how to split revenue from pharmacies to its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief commercial officer, said: "We have transformed the look of our cosmetics pavilions to improve the environment in favor of our customers.
We have also invested in a staff with specialized training, who will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands has been designed to suit every need, and the attractive environment and desirable locations show that we are now an attractive cosmetic destination, which makes a difference to the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones is 'stunned' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
"Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left "ghosted" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his business dedicated to a certain lifestyle, to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and IT."
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homeware and "Truly" accessories.
The business of these two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of "This Morning" turned to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones after pulling out of their lucrative last-minute business dedicated to a certain lifestyle - to focus on her promising new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "stunned" when the golden television girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million in cash - meant she didn't have time for the mark.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand and was projected to double its <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth of assets.
While Willoughby, 37, turned to Instagram to announce her departure from "Truly," Jones has flown out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was definitely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term future that would accompany her over the coming decades.
Her decision to retire left all the people involved absolutely stunned.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close to opening.
In the offices in Marlow there is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to be sold."
Experts think the departure of this morning's presenter, who is one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the firm millions, due to significant investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to open-top clothing and home furnishings, and delays.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as its director in March.
The couple spend the holidays together and Jones holds 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand's ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
"Then we fell in love, and then we fell in love."
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media because of his comment, which some would call "unworthy of a president," and because of the positivity about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump surrendered so much?
He said Trump mockingly imitated the voices of the newscasters.
“I didn’t give up at all.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's de-nuclearization.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, has addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying the North sees no "corresponding response" from North Korea to the U.S. openly.
On the contrary, he said, the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping it under pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Things are going better with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We've got a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - cessation of missile testing, aid in the release of hostages, and returning home the rest of the U.S. military.
In his speech about his relationship with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
“It’s very simple to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake destroys an island, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 percent of Lombok's population, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it clear on many occasions that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a bit challenging," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it's still unclear whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Given the frequent landslides that Indonesia suffers, the country remains very unprepared in the face of nature's anger.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are hard to find in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best conditions, travelling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex. . .
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is traveling to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive in the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo used the improvement of Indonesia's bare infrastructure as a focal point of his election campaign, and has invested generous amounts of money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has worried Mr. Joko's administration, as he faces new elections to be held next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes after clashes between Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, where food, bows and arrows, and other cold weapons were used.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scored a goal equalising against Chelsea in the last minute.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea, with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge took a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to be about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal, while his team was losing 1-0.
He pushed the ball slightly to his left before making a knock on the far gate.
The ball flew over the area until it deviated towards the right and upper edge of the net.
The ball escaped the air jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"The aim was to put myself in the right position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play with the balls ahead, so I tried to create them for myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch, and I didn't think about it too long, but I just hit."
Chelsea led with a 1-0 result in the first half, after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blues striker made a rematch with Mateo Kovacic during that game, before rolling near the pitch and sprinting towards Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic made a quick combination in the midfield.
Then he gave a beautiful vertical pass that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard passed the defense in the speed duel and with a left-handed shot scored on the second pillar, passing the ball behind the wings of Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster agency said in the early hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many people have been trapped under the ruins of buildings devastated by the 7.5-side earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, has been boasted under the ruins of the excavated buildings.

Cromwell's statue in Parliament, the latest monument affected by the debate over "rewriting history"
Its removal would be a deserved punishment for the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "dirty" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "In the midst of the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure would be inscribed outside the Palace of Westminster.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a sacrifice of Cromwell's mistake for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The excellent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many still think deserve to be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament from outside pressure, which, of course, in his case, was a monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate portrayal is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict gave shape to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure who represents one side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Swine Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a pig farm in the Liupanshiu market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is getting ready to inject swine vaccines in a stable on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and uncovered the door of a pig farm nearby.
He said there was a big pig in the stall with a bloody mouth.
A medical examination has confirmed that the 550-pound pig has injured the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were bloodied and crippled," said his cousin identified with the surname "Wu," as quoted in the evening news in Guiyang.
In footage filmed by security cameras, Yuan was seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening's news that the pig was kept in isolation to prevent any further attack, as police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people attacked by pigs have been recorded even before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, injuring their husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer behind his tractor, until his wife drove the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that usually, pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "stimulant."
"They just want to play.
They're like very curious little girls... their purpose isn't to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right respect," he said.
The aftermath of Hurricane Rosa is expected to bring large-scale rainfall to the southwest of the United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa's power is softening as it moves toward the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, over the coming days, Rosa will cause rainfall resulting in flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m., Rosa was accompanied by winds at speeds of 85 miles per hour, classified as Category 1 hurricane, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, on the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form a low-pressure zone of the atmosphere, which is moving eastwards towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa is expected to approach the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she says
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, the interaction of tropical humidity with the low-pressure zone will cause heavy rain over the coming days with extensive rainfall in the Southwest.
At the local level, rainfall at heights of 1 to 4 inches will cause immediate flooding, runoff, and potential landslides in the desert.
The high tropical mildness will cause the rainfall rate in certain areas to reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rainfall are predicted in some areas of the Southwest, mostly over a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate flooding with rapid deterioration of conditions, due to the diffuse nature of tropical rains.
Due to the risk of tropical rains, it is not advisable to travel through the desert on foot.
Heavy rains can turn the canyons into powerful rivers, and squats will bring strong winds and dust storms to the area.
The ripple of the low-pressure area will bring heavy rainfall to parts of California's southern coast.
The total level of precipitation can reach over half an inch, which can cause small spills of debris and slippery roads.
For the region, these will be the first rains of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rains spread further on Monday and Tuesday night.
The heavy rains will spread to all four sides on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October in the U.S. can be characterized by high temperature fluctuations, with temperatures falling in the Arctic, while the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperatures over short distances.
A good example is the drastic temperature difference across the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good portion of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to start October with warm temperatures, with an average of 80, from the Southern Plains to certain parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high chances of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have attended Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that is suspected to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political blockade continued, and broadcasters interrupted regular programs to broadcast the last-minute turn of events on Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and had tried to evict him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a blatant testimony, said he was 100 percent sure this had not happened.
The number of followers is likely to have been greater than that of 20.4 million people, Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company was measuring average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Figures for other broadcast networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting viewers from offices.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football eliminator or that of the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinionists have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest continued to remain high even after the end of the trial.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he faced the protestors' cries as he tried to get into the elevator to attend the rally.
On CNN's live broadcast, he appeared standing with his eyes down for a few minutes while being reprimanded.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He said, "You have the power, but there are so many weak women."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said he would have more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were directly covering the moment the Judiciary Committee would vote on Kavanaugh's candidacy for a vote in front of all members of the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the grounds that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate over the next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators behind him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's election was smart, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has called for an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and compromising national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview accompanying her on the newspaper's main page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued the attack on her Brexit plan, the so-called "Chequers," saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU raise taxes on each other's behalf is "unfortunate."
Wayde Sims Gun Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspect for LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the LSU team.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and interrogated in prison settings on charges of manslaughter, Baton Rouge Police Directorate said.
Official sources have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police have found his glasses at the scene and say they have found traces of Simpson's DNA in them, CBS' WAFB affiliate reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde with a gun, causing his death.
The amount for his release was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The Baton Rouge Forensic Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound from the head to the neck.
The department thanked the fugitive task force at the Louisiana State Police, the state police forensics lab, Southern University police and local citizens for their help with the investigations that led to the arrest of the perpetrator.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva has thanked the area's legislative authorities for "their zeal and for bringing justice to the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six-inch boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had also played basketball for the LSU.
In the last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 hits for each game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "sad" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano pours grace over the city of Mexico
The peak of the Popcatepetl volcano has reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was reawakened and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded within 24 hours.
The center had been monitoring a range of noises and vibrations.
The images on social media showed layers of fine ash that had covered car windows in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with peacekeeping police forces, as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote to secede.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peacekeeping police forces, struck with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that are usually eaten by tourists.
Later in the day there was also a squat, and the police had to use rubber sticks to end the clashes.
For several hours in a row, repeating the slogan “Don’t forget, don’t forgive,” pro-independence groups faced unionist protesters shouting “Goodbye Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where pro-independence sentiments predominate, tensions remain high even a year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters opted for independence, despite low turnout, as citizens against the breakup boycotted the votes.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
On Friday evening, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest continued, but he was forced to take another course.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest along with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalonia would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy that they would have the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that in the local elections of last December they achieved a vital victory, albeit with a narrow result, the Catalan pro-independence parties have had a hard time keeping the law this year, as many of their most well-known leaders have either voluntarily left the country and are in detention and awaiting trial.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in aid of police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody pending trial since the end of last year, said he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"The postponement of the candidacy for the European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and the oppression that has been inflicted on us by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Some People Arrested After Car Crashes Home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car collided several times with a home in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the main gate and the apartment itself.
It is believed that at some point an arrow was thrown in the direction of the car.
Menga's strike forgives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
The team coming from a category below, Livingston surprised the Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as the team's coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's strike turned out to be decisive as Gary Holt's team equalled second-place Hibernian points.
Gerrard's team has not yet won an off-field meeting in the Premiership, this season and next Sunday, they will face the Hearts, the difference with which is eight points.
But before that, the Rangers will be waiting at home at Rapid Vienna, in a valid match for the Europa League, on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended the series of successive victories in six games and coach Holt hasn't yet proven the loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses cases in front of undecided opponents
Holt's team should have gone to the advantage many minutes before they scored, as their direct attacks caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to cross but hit the gate weakly, while then Alan Lithgow hit out on the slip and up after the header from Craig Halkett.
The locals were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems in standard strikes.
That's how the goal was set for the meeting.
The Rangers caused a penalty kick and Livingston created the space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined creating Menga's opportunity, which hit and scored in the center of the area.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated in holding the ball but the local defense had proved unstoppable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost never been put to the test.
This mode of play continued into the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a wait.
Scott Pittman's strike was halted on foot by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor while Lithgow struck out from another standard Livingston strike.
The knockouts came continuously in the Livingston area and were cleaned up continuously, while the two penalty claims - following Halket's intervention against incoming substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for hand touching - were not taken into account.
The game 'Phenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a great performance and a great result for Livingston.
For a man, they played great and continued to exceed expectations on this growing trajectory.
The style of the game and their team hasn't changed much since their return to the top, but a big credit goes to Holt for the way he has electrified the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Although in some cases they played very well under Gerrard's direction, they lacked quality.
Missing the final pass - only once managed to pass the opposing defense - and this is something that should serve as an alarm for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is expected to have feelings in Cologne.
Saturday (September 29) was characterized by a smile of blue skies as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for the morning in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's controversial visit to Germany - which aimed to regulate relations between NATO allies.
They have been at odds over issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Then, Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city houses the largest number of the Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police stopped the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but still many supporters took to the surrounding streets to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of whom were Kurds - also raised their voices to condemn both Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflect the divisive ability of a visitor adored as a hero by some German Turks and despised as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies after car crash
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwoord Street with Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance arrived immediately, but the victim died on the spot.
The collision came months after another cyclist died in an accident where the driver left the scene, which took place on Childers Street, about a mile away from the site of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the person and to notify his family members.
Roads have been closed and buses have been advised to use other roads, while drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six officers injured in a riot
Six prison officers have been injured in a riot in a high-security men's prison, the prison's office said.
The rebellion erupted at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and continues.
Tornado's specialised officers have been called in to keep the riots under control, involving eight detainees and who are confined to one side of the prison.
Officers have received treatment at the scene for some minor injuries to the face.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "The specializedly trained prison staff has been mobilized to keep under control the incident that is currently taking place at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have received treatment for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and have made it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may receive an extension of the prison sentence.”
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had undergone hospital treatment following an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, officers of the peacekeeping police force were called to prison to keep a serious situation under control, where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which could be an advantage for dry areas)
Although it rarely happens that a tropical depression hits Arizona, it's likely that's exactly what will happen in the first days of next week, as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, spreading the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued immediate flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt City.
Rosa is expected to head to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the late hours of Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have received storm or tropical depression status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950."
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches at Arizona's Mogollon border.
In other desert areas in the Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, rainfall is expected to be at the level of 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas out of danger of immediate flooding, Rosa's rainfall can be a blessing, as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some of these precipitations may be useful, as the Southwest is currently facing arid conditions.
"According to the U.S. Center for Dryness Monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme second-category droughts," the report said.
Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still in hurricane power on Sunday morning, with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving northward at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is colliding with cold waters over the Pacific, and as a result, it is losing power.
As a result, the hurricane is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall over some areas of Mexico can be severe, posing a significant risk of flooding.
Rainfall of an average level of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sonora, and can reach up to 10 inches.
Then Rosa will move north through Mexico, in the manner of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching Utah.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its consequences is heavy rainfall in Baja California, in the northwestern Sonora and in the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These precipitations are expected to cause immediate flooding at risk for life, waste drains into deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was escorted to the hospital, where he is currently in a "sustainable" condition.
According to police in Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials have called for the presentation of anyone who may have captured with a mobile phone footage of the event.
Trump says Kavanaugh is "facing the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "facing the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, convincingly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a testimony during the session regarding her indictment.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "the American people demonstrated Kavanaugh's greatness, character, and courage."
"A vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most intelligent lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clean record of public service," he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president recalled Kavanaugh's appointment during a speech on the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not going to run, but I'm contributing," he said.
"That's why I'm trying so hard and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to make “resistance and blockade.”
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, an aide to a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, while numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were eaten by giant waves that collided on beaches when Indonesia's Sulawesi island was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) high collided on the shore in the mud, causing the deaths of many people and destroying everything that came before.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the tsunami threat was born, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, and as a result they did not run immediately and fell victim to it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian news agency, told a news conference.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it took cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traversed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour), before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed the tree to save the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed a series of destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and deformed bridges and a glass surrounded by water.
Shockwaves following the earthquake continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by Friday's massive earthquake was about three times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographical position, which is at the edge of a long, narrow tsunami, may have multiplied the tsunami's power, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great damage" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some bodies were found trapped under the ruins of the excavated buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and the degree of damage could be much higher along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closest to the earthquake's epicentre.
The communication networks were "completely shut down without any warning" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 residents," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were traveling to the affected areas.
"This has already turned into a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was harshly criticized for not giving notice of Paul's tsunami hit, despite officials saying the waves had come at the time the warning was given.
In amateur footage distributed on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard warning passers-by on the way down from the tsunami with furious screams.
Within minutes, a wave collides on the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters did not immediately verify the authenticity of the film.
The quake and tsunami caused a massive power outage, which cut off communications across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun shipping cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people continue to have large needs for food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has only been reopened for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is quite serious.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived smoothly in the city of Palu, where employees are sheltering in tarpaulin shelters in the backyard of their office, they witnessed scenes of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
“They tell me they’ve seen a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is quite serious.
Although aid groups began serious efforts to set in motion humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were being banned from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and external staff can only start circulating if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster,’ we can ask for national aid, but that status has not yet been granted.”
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday in Palu, the friends and families of the missing persons still had hopes that the case of their loved ones would be one of the few miracles that sometimes happen in the event of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a well.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who had been in the rubble for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national parachutist team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which closed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As an old professional in the field of parachutism, I am very emotionally charged,” he said.
Mr Gendon recalls that in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the parachuting community, he had desperately tried to write on WhatsApp to competitors from Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages ended with only one escalation sign in grey, instead of the two signs in blue.
"I think that means the messages weren't sent," he said.
The robbers stole $26,750 during the refill of an ATM in Newport, Levee.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Directorate on Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM in Newport, Leveee.
The driver of the vehicle had been emptying an ATM in an entertainment center and was trying to distribute other money, Detective Dennis wrote in the statement.
While he was busy with work, someone "came running after Brink's employee" and stole a purse of money destined for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses had seen some of the suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a tweet announcing the change on Saturday, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has long been nicknamed Ye, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came just before his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the show, who cannot come for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current art name, West has expressed in the past that the word has a religious meaning to it.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, we're us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only one," to simply "Ye," which is a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, Jay-Z, has done as he has done with or without a separation visa and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use its military against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, army troops opened fire on peaceful protesters in the square, killing nearly 300 people, at a time when student leftist movements were taking hold across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving students monthly grants and opening more public universities free of charge.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education pushes young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount spent on research in this field, said investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government announced discoveries of artificial intelligence, despite the U.S. lacking an official overall strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, announced its plan last year: by 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
“Doubling the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, as other countries are still far behind the United States and we are looking for great next-door discovery in this field,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next big breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence being made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book “The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in the world.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he created an artificial intelligence system that passed to the leading American player at Othello, and then worked as an executive director at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's branch in China.
Lee hailed the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects in the Field of Defense, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to help identify the visionaries.
Lee said that often, researchers in the U.S. have to work hard to get grants from the government.
“It’s not China that’s driving away academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have employed enlightened minds from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. push its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to people with a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released the Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding for people in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations provide money for American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at setting up a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to decide if its name would be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that could resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which had blocked its efforts at NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim over its territory, and has imposed blocking vetoes on its NATO and EU membership.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the 50 percent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot reads: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership through the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, this is a price worth paying to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said they will stick to the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election of 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, we have the country in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on changing the name of Macedonia, which would pave the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents erected by the referendum boycotters.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not entering from the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us in the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be pro, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are pro-EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would "confirm our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - a figure below the required level of participation.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 percent of the participants had plans to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
For a successful referendum, the participation rate should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would give it the first strong blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through all of Brighton's defenses to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling faced Brighton's entire defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored his goal in the 65th minute to look exceptionally easy.
Argentina's hunter took a midfield pass at the start of the action.
He scrambled through three Brighton defenders before coming out on the open field.
Afterwards, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He overcame a defender and went into a speeding duel with several others at the entrance to the Brighton area.
He then went to the left where Sterling was.
The English striker took advantage of his exit into the area to follow the Agueros ball, which hit with the right and passed goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by throwing the ball at the right corner of the net.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We thought he was going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball in the Brighton Hemisphere.
He's got a nice vertical for Laroy Sane on his left arm.
Sane advanced a few steps before heading towards Sterling on the second pillar.
The blue attacker took the ball into the net and then slipped off the limiting lines.
City will face Hofenheim in the valid challenge for the Champions League group stage on Thursday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to keep the role of the "squatter" against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the chance to reach the eliminators, there was no reason to impose another start.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to score against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a playoff opportunity for the Rockies, who have an advantage with a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies reached at least one playoff chance thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to take the division title.
"Although we are playing for no reason, we can at least score by recognizing the atmosphere of the fans here in Denver and the fact that the opposing team will play at the highest level that I can face all year round.
Why wouldn't I want to play in a game like this?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the headliners on Sunday, but it is reported that they are likely to leave Scherzer to start the meeting in such situations.
Scherzer, for whom the 34th title appearance would be, held a training session on Thursday and could appear on the pitch on Sunday, which could be a normal day off for him.
The player from Washington, who shot right is 18-7 with an ERA 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 of shots this season.
Trump gathers West Virginians at a rally
The president referred back to the situation regarding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, before talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"June is crucial for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the biggest choices -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this awful group of radical democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they have split the mind to regain power in any way, you see the humiliation of their ugliness.
They don't want to know who they're hurting, who they're pushing with their feet to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to make “resistance and blockade.”
"And you've seen this over the last few days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, cruel, dirty and unfaithful."
He referred to the Democratic Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, which sparked outrage from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did you get the document?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, I... wait a minute... - her body language was pretty bad - it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an "open church."
She is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted for the motion of no confidence in me, they weren't so upset.
After all, I'm not the first of Labour MPs who are told they're not welcome - all because we say what we think.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan was treated similarly, simply because he strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of no confidence was a criticism of me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, ironically similar issues for which Jeremy fell into conflict with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Labour Party's meeting in Nottingham East, it was said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight-year tenure as local Labour Party MPs, GC meetings have been like this.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "softer and more polite" policy has long been forgotten, if ever existed.
It has become increasingly apparent that opposite views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues I thought shared similar political views began to claim that I would take a 180-degree turn and hold positions that I would never have agreed to - whether on national security or on the EU-only market.
Every time I speak in public - no matter what I say - criticisms on social media explode, with people calling for my dismissal, denouncing center policies, telling me I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who suffered this.
I am aware that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but they don't.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political epoch is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an "open church", and with every motion of confidence and with every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly closed.
Over the past two years, I’ve been advised often to lower my head, not to be so noisy, and that so everything “will be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, driven by the Thatcher government's disrespect that led to the failure of my class in a general school, I've been trying to lobby for better government services for those who need it most - whether as a member of a mini-counsel.
I've never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had my political views and points of contradiction with the current leadership.
To all those who voted for the motion on Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect our families, businesses and public services. I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy with my allegiance to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to be at your service and I promise you that no threat of dismissal or political favor will stop me from acting in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr leads the list
The two delayed attempts may have somehow altered the final result, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in today's extremely entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Now they lead the lists as the only undefeated team among ten teams.
In the end, it was their wonderful defense and the courage to take risks that secured the victory for the local team, and coach Peter Murchie was absolutely right to be happy.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still invincible, so I'm normally happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "We want to congratulate the Ayr team, who took more risks than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, returned to the goal by Frazier Climo, passed Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who came for this challenge from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to show off his superiority and morphed.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty while just before the end of the first half, he scored and returned to the goal an individual action bringing the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, backed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Afterwards, there was a long interruption as a result of the severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left with a barrel, and after the resumption of the game, Ayr increased the score through an attempt by Stafford McDowall, scored by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was later punished with a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the fact that they had one more player, with a knockout attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard-fought part.
However, the locals returned and when Struan Hutchinson was punished with a yellow card because he blocked Climo, without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made a "touch down" behind Ayr's (maul) back who was advancing forward.
Climo scored and did almost the same after the restart of the game, after Kyle Rowe caught the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and led forward attacking player (flanker) Gregor Henry, for the home team's fifth attempt.
The "Still Game" star seems set for a new career in the restaurant industry
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems set to enter the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, with co-writer and co-starring his long-term partner in the comedy world, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that season nine will be the last for the show, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to enter Glasgow's "blossoming restaurant industry."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia with no exit to the sea hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol an improvisation of the naval fleet headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings have raised the blue flag of the ocean.
On the seabed from Lake Titicaca in the Amazon, the motto is: "The sea is our property.
"Resuming it is a duty."
Across Bolivia without going to sea, the memory of taking the coast from Chile into a bloody conflict for springs during the 19th century is still quite alive - as is the desire to sail once again across the Pacific Ocean.
Now, these hopes are far greater than they have ever been for decades, while on October 1, Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is characterized by hovi, the spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course, it is positively waiting for the result," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the GJND session on big screens across the country, with the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in Bolivia's favor that - after decades of irregular discussions - Chile is forced to hold talks to give Bolivia a chance.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle to secure his second term in next year's elections - Monday's decision is quite important.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts are of the opinion that it is very unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia - and that even if it did, it would change quite a few things.
The U.N. body, which is based in the Netherlands, has no qualms about giving another state part of Chile's territory, and has said it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the GJND is coming out with a decision just six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of helping Bolivia's cause, the events of the past four years may have penalized it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has wiped out every trace of charity left to the Chileans, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision was surprisingly quick.
Monday will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end the 139-year-old disputes, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue for political interests.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to understand that we must leave it behind in the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't take place as long as it can't trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will not be the first to disarm nuclear weapons as long as it can't trust Washington.
The young man was giving a speech in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of a resurgence of nuclear diplomacy so far “sleeping,” more than three months after Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
The hopes that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration to end the Korean War will make North Korea fall to its knees are hopeless.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make significant disarmament moves, Washington is hesitant to accept the statement.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's intention to withdraw its arsenal, which the state most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant chapels, which will soon come to the streets of your city
If you want to enrich your hat collection or provide complete protection from the sun's rays, look no further.
Stylists Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of strange giant hats for their SS19 collection on catwalks, which left all stylists open at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have taken to Instagram this summer, and these stylists have brought their amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's special creation was a highly extravagant apron hat, decorated with a wide shelter with hood-like details, which surrounded the model's head.
Other great accessories included stone-decorated apricots, a magic hat, and even a pineapple - but they're not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of strange masks - together in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had tight lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature resembled a diving device, supplemented by an air tube and glasses of water, while another resembled a melted ice cream cage.
And if you like to follow this bold fashion - you're in luck.
Fashion analysts predict that giant hats may soon come to the streets of your city.
The trend of giant hats has followed that of "La Bomba", the two-legged straw hat that we've all seen, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that hides behind the highly impractical hat it got on social media, brought out another big creation in the catwalk - a beach bag made of straw, almost as big as the model with bathing clothes who was wearing it.
The bright orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia dense and with a white leather handle at the top, was the most special creation of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer I expect to see a giant beach hat and bag on the streets of cities - as the stylist has left such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: Essential Language Skills for Global Citizens
Private schools in Scotland hold the record for academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another row of excellent test results, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education at the highest levels, for the careers chosen by them and their country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted educational curriculum, we are demonstrating how the modern language web continues to be a widespread and popular choice across schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, your words come to them.
If you speak to him in your own language, your words will go to his heart.”
These words are a powerful reminder that we can't rely solely on English when we want to build relationships with people from foreign countries.
From the results of last year's exams, we can find that languages are leading the results lists, with the highest rate of passing grades among private schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have received a maximum score of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students had received the maximum grade A in Mandarin, while 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish also received the maximum grade A in Mandarin.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Currently, the branch of foreign languages is considered as important as the STEM branches (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of private schools and beyond.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom's Employment and Skills Commission found that among the main difficulties employers faced in filling vacancies, 17 percent of them were related to a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming more and more necessary for preparing young people for their future careers.
With the addition of jobs that require the mastery of foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as a possessor of such a long-term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person above competitors.
According to a YouGov survey, which included over 4,000 adults from the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by 15 people.
This is the reason why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Mastering many languages, and especially mastering the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages learned in them.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a variety of languages you can choose from in private schools, with pedagogical staff composed of field specialists.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a school environment that will prepare children and "arm" them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of the future.
At this time there is no denying the fact that in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered as the “capacity of international communication”.
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron is set to make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who were waiting to see LeBron James in his first Log Angeles Lakers game.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than 1 and fewer than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers correspondent tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Time of Trump's rallies in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump has launched a series of electoral rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five such gatherings planned to take place next week, including stops in friendly areas that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval suspended for his election to fill the vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the ballots are held in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia today and how to follow it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time today evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's rally in West Virginia online below, via live stream on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will address this week's hearings at the High Court of candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was tensed over allegations of his sexual misconduct, with the Senate's expected vote of confirmation remaining suspended for a week as the FBI cracked down.
But the primary purpose of these multiple gatherings is to help Republicans take a leap forward in the face of November's elections.
Trump's campaign staff said the five rallies next week were intended to "energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans struggle to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the tight season of the campaign," a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Planned to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's rally could bring back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia's Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost to the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team showed readiness to fight while keeping hopes alive by heading to singles races on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the remaining four for Sunday afternoon, could be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This swing of momentum, is a completely created sports concept, but a concept where players really believe in and never more than in such races.
Where can we say we're feeling this momentum?
"They had a six-point gap that has now gone to four, so we can say that it's created up to somewhere a kind of bulge I believe," Spieth said as he closed the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage with four points ahead, when they stay in the game and twelve points.
According to Spieth, Americans hope the odds are in their favor and have a lot to encourage, especially from the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day where they got three out of four possible points.
Spieth has been ruthless from the start of the shooting to the pit and is leading by giving his example.
The party cheers increased as the round went on, pushing the golf ball in with an easy hit to take the match to the draw, when he and Thomas were first two points down after two rounds.
His easy shot that gave them the win of the game in the 15th hole was greeted with a similar cheer, which shows he believes the American team is still not out of the race.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your game," Spieth said.
All the players are gone now.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but adorable European couple has achieved four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Moliwood were the only couple who didn't catch a shot over the minimum on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shooting over the minimum on Sunday morning, Friday evening, and at nine second shots on Friday morning.
This result and the way in which their energy seems to flow to the enthusiastic and sidekick crowd reinforces the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday and that there will be no player more famous than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible victory for the National.
Possibly both at the same time in different pits.
However, it is still premature to declare a European triumph.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very easy with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-morning games, when he fell in love with Alex Noren.
One point above the minimum and two two to nine ahead put the Spaniard and the Swede in a pit from which they had no chance of getting out anymore.
However, on Sunday, no one will be there to help you get out of your pit.
The four-and-a-half games are so amazing to watch closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy there can be changed.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the final, but these four sessions also showed that the U.S. team is still going to fight even though some people, especially Stateside, have doubted this.
Europe tops 10-6 as they head to the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a key advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup as it has come out of the four games and with couples with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two-win race against a struggling Tiger Woods to increase their four-point lead at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, offered to take the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the powerless American team in the two-morning games, leading to the 3-1 series of results.
The American team showed more resistance in the four-game game, winning two games, but they couldn't reduce the difference.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, dubbed Molliwood, are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening games after a sensational weekend.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth game, they combined well enough to beat a powerless Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic 5&4 score.
Woods, who had a hard time holding two meetings on Saturday, showed repeated outbursts of greatness, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 games in the game four and with pairs and 7 games in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the fourth game of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the pairing game and took a 2&1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn't have everything in favor on a pretty cool day in southwest Paris.
Three-time professional winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the difference that should have been caught by the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They took a bold 2&1 win against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four games and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in pairs after losing in the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned the result after a four-point difference in individual games, although the Fury holder team only needs one draw to hold the trophy.
However, since he was the second best player for two days, a Sunday counterattack seems to go beyond their means.
North Korea says it will not be disarmed “in any way” unilaterally without gaining confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the sanctions continued on Saturday were deepening distrust of the United States and the country would not in any way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
New Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly body from around the world that North Korea had taken "important measures showing goodwill" last year, such as banning nuclear and missile tests, dismantling areas where nuclear and nuclear tests were not carried out, and deploying nuclear weapons.
"However, we are not seeing any response to this from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the U.S., our national security will not be self-confident and under these circumstances there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's usual grievances over Washington's resistance for a "phased" approach to the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be assessed because of the gradual steps it has taken, his statement appeared to be unimportant.
The young man referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between an incumbent U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards the "nuclear interconnection" of the North Korean peninsula.
North Korea has called for an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea, he said.
"The United States insists on carrying out 'nuclear disarmament' and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compulsive manner, even by opposing 'the declaration of the end of the war,'" he said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees are dreams in the sun of people who are uninformed about us.
"But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is deepening our distrust."
He did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the parties to the nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea and not the U.S., the nuclear disarmament process would have no bearing on the Korean peninsula."
Despite this, the tone used in the New Speech was profoundly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that putting U.S. territory under target with North Korean missiles was unavoidable after Trump's "Mr. Devil President" call it a "death to me."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that the sanctions should continue to be enforced.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for it, saying "If it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Penian for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and uninterruptedly until we complete the verification and verification process."
The Security Council has unanimously decided to increase sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end funding for Penian's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met New side by side at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Penian again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go so well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying there had been progress, and only within hours North Korea denounced him for having carried out "mafia-style demands."
North Korea pledged a meeting with Moon this month to disarm a missile zone and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "relevant measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking lessons on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has involved all students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of study 'masks' through the use of caffeine from these 'sleepers.'
One academic noted that world's number one university students often have no idea when it comes to the most basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the lecture course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start this course after he gave a paper on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl approached me and said, 'Why is this being told to me now, in my last year?'
She said no one had talked to her before about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains to students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and also how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's general director of medical services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep over the course of a week.
An hour-long course involves a range of interdisciplinary tasks.
On one side is a view of a convivial room, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, athletes and books in order to explain to them the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the sleeping routine.
In another part, participants were explained how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risks of heart attack, ischemia, depression, and cancer.
A map of the camp, with interacting icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know - the health impact when you choose to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride to spend “a night of pay” continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was an ever-increasing problem.
Ensuring you’ve got enough sleep, of a good quality, should be students’ ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation leads the brain into a starving mode, making them starve.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to turn it into a course for the whole camp.
He hopes that the next step, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining competing institutions.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should set an hour clock when they should go to bed, and also when they should wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of ‘blue light’ coming out of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can bring the rhythm of the smog into the biological environment.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga scores against Gerrard's boys
The Rangers took another hit as visitors as Dolly Menga's hit gave Steven Gerrard's disbanded side a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was looking to record his first win since the February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused his second loss in 18 games as coach, leaving his team eight points behind the outgoing Premier of Lad.
Menga scored seven minutes before the first half ended and with a set of the Rangers team that seemed completely powerless to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third and is right behind Hibernian for goal difference.
The Rangers can expect to have more trouble after their arm player Calum Spence was treated for a blow to the head after being hit by an object likely thrown by visiting fans.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, which aired in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, pitched the same 11-pointer who kidnapped a Hearts point last week and that he would be pleased with how his well-organized team suffocated opponents in each round.
The Rangers may have dominated in holding the ball, but Livingston created more when he owned it.
They should have scored just two minutes from the start of the meeting, when Menga's first pass to Scott Pittman in the Allan McGregor-protected gate square wasn't exactly used by him throwing the ball out.
A long cross from the penalty shot by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, just shot him out at the back pillar of the gate.
The Rangers took control of the game but it seemed that they hoped more than they really believed in their game in the opposing area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after a four-hour game as he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson didn't hear the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers managed to make two shots at the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly wasn't worried about Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been at odds with what was being seen on the pitch, no one can deny that they deserved it just for the fight they showed.
The Rangers again failed in the long-running service to the Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept calm to pass Menga and score in a simple way.
Gerrard acted in the rest between the parts while replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this change for a little while did not give an immediate effect while the side followed Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran from his position to block him.
But Livingston continued to make the guests play as they wished, with Lithgow and Halkett following each other with long balls from time to time.
Holt's team could extend his lead to the final stage, but McGregor stood strong and denied Jacobs before Lithgow shot out of a ball taken from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton later claimed another penalty during the game, while he got confused with Jacobs, but again Thomson allowed the lead.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger gauge
And now a page from our almanac of "Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, as today 136 years ago and ONCE... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for the detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as the Geiger Meter.
A major pillar of science since then, the Geiger gauge has become a major pillar of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film The Coronado's Days, with a cast of seemingly non-professional scientists such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger gauge used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
"When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released from radioactivity into minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, I'm really listening now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines Teach the Immune System to Recognize Bad Cells as Part of the Treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory.
They can ‘extract’ a protein commonly found in many types of cancer and then be re-injected
A vaccine that is being tested is showing promising results in patients who have some types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, noted that ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they ‘remove’ a protein commonly found in some types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients "to teach" them how to detect cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West appeared at a Pro-Trump rally, wearing a hat with the inscription MAGA, after his appearance on the SNL.
It doesn't go well
Kanye West hailed protests in the studio during a broadcast on Saturday Night Live, following a disappointing performance where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night called “Ghost Town,” where he was wearing a hat on his head that wrote “Make America Great,” he went on to speak out strongly against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to a white person and they say to me, 'How can you like Trump, he's racist?'
"Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a parody starring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star played the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual harassment brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, recordings of West's harsh speech were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with that post or not.
West also complained to the spectators that he had spent a difficult time behind the scenes because of what he had put in his head.
"They hurt me in the back.
I was told, ‘Don’t go on stage with that hat on your head.’
They've mistreated me!
And then they tell me that I'm deep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom?", expressing that "I put my superman hat on my head, because it shows that no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try the love."
His comments received taunts at least twice from spectators and members of the SNL cast appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reports, where one person told the newspaper: "The whole studio fell silent."
West was called as a late replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many people with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous souls: THANK YOU FOR THE BALL OF THE TURM."
But broadcast moderator Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "she herself and this is extraordinary."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (buying music or clothing or supporting his 'art') for whom I believe he shames you and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
While he's free.
That's how we are," she added.
Before the show, the singer stated on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was already "the dog that used to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper friend, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and also the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and later the artist known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder with a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast First-Level Court on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the Public Prosecution Service.
'Game of Thrones' star Kit Harington enjoys masculinity toxicity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword in the character Jon Snow, in the violent series of medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor has hit the stereotype of the male hero, saying that the appearance of such roles on the screen, makes the young boys perceive that they need to behave as strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something went wrong” and wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of the #MeToo movement.
Kit, who recently married his fellow Game of Thrones actress, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "quite important" solving the issue.
"I personally feel this issue is quite important at the moment - where did we go wrong with the appearance of masculinity?" he said.
"What have we learned to men as they grow up, about the problems we are facing now?"
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to over-male characters appearing there.
He continued: "What is born and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and what is taught on the street, which makes young boys believe that they have to behave in a certain way to feel like men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
"Obviously something has gone wrong with the kids."
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer shoot for "Game of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of next summer, saying that "herds and horses have come to the top of his nose."
Starting in November, Kit will take part in a stage remake of True West by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother the thief.
The actor recently revealed that dating his wife Rose is the best thing he got from Game of Thrones.
"In this production I found the wife, so we can say that this show gave me the next family and defined my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the sentimental interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning science-fiction series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected across the country, health authorities say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse, showing a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking the HIV virus through this way had almost gone to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still said to be prevalent.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have found that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease occurs due to inadequate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to medicines for the treatment of HIV as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP senators’ data has been disseminated by staff members, saying these are “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' websites on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that these claims were being pushed by experts and "extreme right-wing" online sites.
"Lies, lies, and only disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after all three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative sites, such as 'Gateway Pundit' and 'RedState', reported that the IP addresses identifying the source of the publications were linked to the Waters office and leaked the data of a Waters staff member, Hill reports.
"This baseless claim is totally untrue and a big lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these false and alleged claims - has in no way been responsible for the leakage of this information.
"This unfounded claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' statement immediately faced online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is frustrated," Fleischer wrote.
"That means she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, he shouldn't be nervous.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
There is no need to question the motives of the accused.
He has to be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing very nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to replace Waters in the mid-term elections, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"Great speed, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Waters said her office had signalled "the relevant authorities and law enforcement institutions on these false allegations."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have a destructive and dangerous effect on everyone on my staff."
Review of "Johnny English Hits Again" - a comedy with unequipped spy material Rowan Atkinson
It has become the case that in every new British-influenced film, hidden messages about the subject of Brexit are seen and this finds application also in the revival on the stage of the comedy-action "Johnny English" - which has its beginnings in 2003 with "Johnny English" and the year 2011 with the revival of "Johnny English".
Will this satirical comedy bring out how clearly incapable we are of associating with new national opportunities in the field of exports?
In any case, the eye-catching character, with his face like a rubber and apparently Johnny English's face, has been given permission to confuse things for the second time - his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a wide-ranging comic creature crafted for territories where they don't speak English.
Of course he is a missing secret agent, who despite surprisingly pretending to appear as charming, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean's character and a portion of that guy who only contributed with the release of a sound in the 2012 opening song 'Chariots of Fire' at the Loppa ceremony.
It is also based on the man of mysteries, the traveler and the international Atkinson, who once played in television commercials that are now forgotten about the Barclaycard, leaving the place in chaos wherever he broke.
There are a couple of good moments in this movie.
I liked it a lot when Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propeller blade crashed a little bit into his helmet.
This shows the gift of Atkinson’s physical comedy, but the humour seems to be faint and sometimes excessive, especially when ‘serious’ films like 007 and Mission Impossible have added a little bit of comedy as an ingredient to their films.
Humor seems to be aimed at children more than adults, and Johnny English's crunchy events are not so creative and are focused on voiceless movements, the same as what Atkinson does in Bean's character.
The permanent theme of this film is the fact that the UK is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British agents, uncovering the identities of British agents on the ground and has swayed the agent on duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a prime minister who appears as a pompous figure and ready to fight, who is already suffering an extraordinary political non-popularity: Emma Thompson does her best to realize the character that resembles Teresa May, but there's not much text in the script that she can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, so she will have to rely on someone who has retired.
And that means choosing Johnny English himself, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-class neighborhood, but who unofficially taught how to become a covert agent: here are beautiful scenes, because English is offering a spy academy in the form of a rock school.
English is summoned back to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and reunited with his former assistant, multiplayer Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-end girl, where Vicki Pepperdine is used a little mischief for this role.
So Batman and Robin's doing things totally backwards in the Secret Service of Her Majesty, are back in action, battling the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is captivated by the attractive tech billionaire who claims he can solve the difficulties of British computers: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their funny and expressive odyssey: disguised as cameramen, they set fire to a beautiful French restaurant; they cause chaos as they enter the luxurious yacht of Volta without permission; and English is totally confused as she tries to share her familiar devices with Virtual Reality.
All the sequences are normally done for the final stage, but despite being entertaining and noisy, the whole thing looks a bit like a children's film.
It's pretty moderate.
Just like in other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: isn't there a role for Rowan Atkinson in the British film industry that would fit his talent?
The Labour Party denies it has a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corby, is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week - but pay for five.
The party is reported to want company bosses to save using the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution for employees, giving them an extra day off.
We would see that employees would enjoy a weekend with three days off - but continuing to bring home the same pay.
The sources said the idea would “match” the party’s economic agenda and plans to return the country in favor of workers.
Moving to a four-day week is an idea that has been embraced by Congress as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected before the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen immediately, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that aligns with the party's approach to balancing the economy in favor of employees and also with the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where the Green Party has previously pledged a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
At present, however, this aspiration is not being supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to convey his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to shift power from “anonymous directors” and “beneficiaries” to public service firms.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also imply that the current shareholders in the water companies may not take back all their shares, because the Labour government may carry out ‘deductions’ on the grounds of actions considered a breach.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to create the All-Inclusive Property Funds to pass on to employees 10 percent of the capital of private sector firms, which means a dividend paid per year worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell in '60 Minutes' if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises questions about whether the Bureau of Investigation's findings could affect any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his college from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that when I was entering the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I got him on the phone after this happened, so after the claims came out and I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined and clear."
However, Graham's voice seems to have been carved into stone.
"I've shared my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make any bomb accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she mentioned couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical show that features a large and impressive list of stars who perform and also have an equally impressive mission; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host crowds of thousands of people at the Great Lawn in Central Park who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also become aware of the true purpose of the show, to the end.
The Global Citizen Festival, which launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to take advantage of a free ticket for the show (except when you want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, making a phone call or any other way of understanding.
But how successful was the Global Citizen Festival when there were 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince them to seek these interventions, or is it just another case of what is known as "click-actionism" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen is said to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, giving it a boost to various goals.
These actions are said to have helped spur world leaders to declare $37 billion in political commitments, which are said to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 claims and statements as a result of the group's actions, where at least $10 billion has already been distributed or secured as funds.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of UK-based investors and implementing agencies, committed to "helping children to grow to their full potential," promising to "give Rwanda a lot of $35 million to end up with."
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a memory of the past," the Power of Nutrition ambassador told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition," which will affect 5 million women and children in need of food intervention.
In an answer to their most frequently asked questions on their website, they asked, "What makes you believe we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we'll fall and we'll fail.
But like every high civil right and like the anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will do it, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the actors who will perform at this year's New York show, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy as a "blockade" to curb Russia's energy exports
"If necessary," Washington could rely on its navy to prevent Russian energy from spreading through markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to a Washington Examiner citation.
Zinke claims Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it is operating at the request of the legitimate Syrian government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to this official, there is a way to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block them, to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an activity carried out by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit organization that has personified itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that these approaches are practically the same.
"The economic option over Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and substitution of incinerators," he said, referring to Russia as "a deceptive hub" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration undertook a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into a "robe" of Moscow.
Moscow has consistently stated that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is claimed to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to bring it to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's ardent opposition to the project is simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of problems when a third country interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously" consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously" take part in the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for president.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our destroyed government and that includes putting a woman at the top," she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during a rally in the city, saying he "is taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his High Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "that of course before the vote we need an investigation by the FBI."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a large proportion of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for the candidacy, with 38 percent supporting a possible candidacy and 48 percent opposed the candidacy.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed about competing in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Trak Paul's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally
Track Paul, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the military in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he is back, I can connect with other families who feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers are returning to," she told attendees at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul called his arrest an "elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans, "come a little changed, hardened, come thinking about whether they get the proper respect from soldiers and airmen and other members of the military, for what they have given the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence following an attack on a woman, following a report of domestic violence and gun violence while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states in D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal opposition to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who have rescued criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the county filed an explanatory document as a friend-to-judge in Washington on Friday in support of changing asylum-seeking policies, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
It was stopped in Texas.
State attorneys who are supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce a high number of asylum seekers in the U.S. because they are countries that have widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum-seeking policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented migrants to escape domestic violence and apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be judged on the facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure runs counter to this principle," the court said in a statement.
Lawyers further argued in the report that the police's ban on the entry of migrants harmed the U.S. economy, saying their chances were to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary arm of work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims who are fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," Sessions said on June 11, the day of the policy statement.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in a race to find survivors
To the survivors, the situation was very honorable.
"The situation feels quite tense," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while keeping her sick young son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palusa.
"The ambulance brings in the bodies every minute.
There is no clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, bringing out their belongings submerged in water, in an effort to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-face earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken his back and shoulder, were taken to the Military Hospital outside Palusa, where patients are being treated in outdoor settings as earthquakes continue.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recalled the violent tremor of the earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save myself.
I think I was crushed under the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard the woman crying and asking for help, but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Propaganda Advertising’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad on a U.S. daily that propagandized the shared benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement to the "Des Moines Register" - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in U.S. congressional elections held on Tuesday and Tuesday.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalated campaign to increase pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an escalating trade war that has seen the equilibrium of tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts have said China's retaliatory tariffs in this trade war were set to hit exporters in countries like Ioua, which has backed Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor for a long time at Ioua, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad wrote that, "China is already doubling this harassment by putting propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"By distributing its propaganda, the Chinese government is being helped by the gratifying American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the street newsstands here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against it and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese may have about China's economic worrisome trajectory," he said.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China, he avoided the offer to publish his article," even though he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that Republicans are blackmailing women voters ahead of midterm elections after the Kavanaugh scandal
As many leading Republicans stand in solidarity and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of some allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will face a harsh reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions on the subject have been very high, and many Republicans have publicly stated that they want to continue voting for the candidate.
These things can't be undone," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute attempt at an FBI investigation and that it would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it either tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior national adviser and spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is Coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate’s corridors as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach its peak," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's already been on high levels; that's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among undecided women voters in the periphery and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, even though they don't like the president, usually don't vote at all."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested there would be a harsh reaction if Republicans continued to support this candidacy.
"This has turned into a puzzling mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether or not Kavanaugh will be placed in the defendant's bank, it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with this issue and how they have dealt with that woman," Guy Cecil, the director of Priority USA, told NBC News.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to trust in the vigil of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with the latter having a slightly higher backing.
A recent poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents doubtless or highly likely believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they doubtless or highly likely believe Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent think that Kavanaugh, most likely or undoubtedly, lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent say the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating claims made by Ford and other indictees, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh assaulted him at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the High Court candidate showed his genitals to her while they were at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, is setting up a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, ‘Inrupt,’ is a company built by Berners-Lee’s open source platform, called ‘Solid’.
‘Solid’ allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons are allowed access to a certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create "storage of their personal data on the network" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, music lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having available in a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique about the storage of personal data on the network, is the fact that it remains completely in the user's hands what kind of information they will access.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to bring together the right resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several contracted developers to work on this project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they should introduce a total change where all of their business models are completely overturned at night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post in Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over network impartiality.
While founding Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the consortium of the World Wide Web, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of networking," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann celebrates the giving of the Victorian Cross to the clergy during the First World War
The only cleric to have won a Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter is commemorated in his homeland 100 years later.
The lieutenant colonel, the Honourable Bernard Vann, won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the nephews, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the commemoration of exactly 100 years of the heroic act that gave the medal to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the hail of bullets from fields and machine guns."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with "great courage" led the battalion forward and captured one of the weapons on the battlefield and killed only three people by the opposing troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, decided on a crown after the parade, which was run by the group 'Brentwood Imperial Youth'.
Michael Vann said he "felt quite honored to be part of this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is being shown by the support being given to him by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but instead saw "The Pepper Runner."
Imagine, you've stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and then the opportunity to watch this major event is taken away.
The show from San Jose contained 13 dulufments, including six dulufments in the base package and would appear in real time overnight on Channel 5, in the UK.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, viewers in Britain were stunned when the broadcast was altered to show Pepa the Pig.
Some were dissatisfied after staying up all night until the early hours, especially for this match.
A fan on Twitter described the transition from the game to a children's cartoon as "an ugly joke."
"It's the government's rules that determine that at 6 a.m. that content wasn't appropriate for that and we had to move on to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
""Pep's Derek," after."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"When I think about retransmission, I think we can solve it," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning, Sunday, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our own clock, so Monday with their clock.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed there were a lot of messages circulating and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I promise it won't happen next time.
"We're going to do the show with five games instead of six - as we usually do - we tried to give more for the fans and maybe we've outdone ourselves.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ About His Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to achieve success.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't understood until he went to nine-year-old school that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised his voice for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning Olympic medals.
The long-term program's permanent presenter, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because she is sick.
Appearing as an outcast in Laverne's first show, Daley said that as he grew up he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt different, have been the real elements that gave me the push and strength to get through it."
He wanted to prove that he was worth "something," he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexual orientation.
Two-time Olympic bronze medalist, he is already a high-profile LGBT high-profile activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal more to countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he came out openly because he felt lucky that he was able to live openly and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
Three times the world champion said falling in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "captured me unprepared."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference has never been a problem.
"When you experience so many things at such a young age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole outlook" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all I thought was ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if we had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'cause you can't be in the front row dad," he said.
"I was holding his hand while he couldn't breathe and only after he couldn't breathe and changed his life, I admitted for the first time that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I'd dreamed of all my life - diving in front of the local public at the Olympics, there was no more beautiful feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first musical selection - Proud by Heather Small - which has accompanied him during preparations for the Olympics and continues to cause trouble.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, left on the bench on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but will have to change his shape in order not to turn this historic moment into a disappointment.
Mickelson, for whom it is the 12th time to participate in this event, a record himself, which is held every two years, was left on the table by Captain Jim Furyk, during the doubles (fourballs and foursomes).
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it usually has been for the United States, the five-time big title winner spent the day supporting the team and hoping to leave behind the concerns.
Not among the players with the right shot even when he was at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the complicated field of Le Golf National, where long and difficult courses leave no room for wrong shooting.
And if only fear of the field was not enough, Mickelson, on Sunday, in the ninth game will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win their fourth game this week.
If the Americans, who have four points less, before the start of 12 singles games, start it fast, Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, although he could not say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he played today, hit me on the shoulders, threw his hand at my neck and told me he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past, and over the course of this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I had thought more, but in the end it turned out so we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the player with the most appearances in Ryder Cup matches.
He could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, where he has not been at the height of his individual appearances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Fury said his presence brings value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to bully people, and he's a fantastic guy to have in the team room," he said.
"Also, I think the younger players were having fun facing him, during this week, and that was nice to see.
It's more than just a game."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the great leadership can disappear very quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows from experience that the considerable lead they have ahead of the last day of singles games in the Ryder Cup, can turn into an unpleasant factor.
Danezi made his debut in the 1997 faceoff at Valderrama, where team captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans and ended the tournament by winning with a very narrow difference, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"It reminds me that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with great difficulty," said Bjorn, who is photographed after seeing a 5-3 win in the 2018 Class on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 in the National Le Golf.
So the story tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we'll take the last walk.
We'll go there and do the right thing.
Nothing's finished until we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win this trophy and here is our focus.
I've said it all along, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we're facing - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush into this stage.
Tomorrow we will face another ‘monster’.
Tomorrow, the individual performances come out, and that's something else that needs to be done.
It's great when you're on the pitch with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, then you're tested in your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now, forget your partner because he has to go and give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope his players perform better individually than with partners, with the exception of only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, getting three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced both major comebacks in the final day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing to what is considered the team's "Miracle in Medinah."
"I remember every word," when asked how he had motivated his players during Captain Ben Crenshaw's last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we have to have a good start, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When you get a run on one arm, you put a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
"We set the line-up based on that and we're going to put the guys in the ranking that we believe is best, as you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas will face Rory McIlroy in the lead, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will face European players in the top half.
"I chose this group and in this ranking I believe it covers the whole journey to the game," Bjorn said of his solo selections.
The production of the new German warplane has been postponed.
The new German Navy frigate should have been sent in 2014 to replace cold-war-time warships, but it won't be ready until at least next year due to problematic systems and rather high costs, local media reported.
The shipment of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after shipping damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which were commissioned by the navy in 2007, will serve as replacements for the old Bremen-class frigates.
The medium is known to contain a powerful ball, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and anti-detection (stealth) technology, such as radar detection reduction, red infractions and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for new frigates to be moved for more than two years away from the country's ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the latest technology battleships - which are said to allow Germany to reflect power abroad - will be obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit writes.
The 'unfortunate' F125 frigate was launched last year when the German Navy officially refused the order for the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to its builder after its surrender.
Little information was given about the reasons for the return, but media in Germany quoted it as being a series of "major software and hardware defects" that rendered the ship useless during a war mission.
The problems in programming were particularly important on the Baden-Württemberg-class ships because they would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - as much as half of the workforce of the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was severely overweight, which reduced its yield and limited the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice the weight of similar-category ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physical parts with problems, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also turning into a problem.
It is said to have reached a figure of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) - from the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion that was originally forecast.
The problems that have gripped the new frigates are becoming particularly important after recent warnings that the German navy's power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, admitted that the Navy was "finishing the appropriate ships to move to another country."
The official said the problem had increased over time because the old ships had been taken out of service but had not been replaced with new ones.
He regretted that none of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates would be able to join the navy.
The National Trust observes the secret life of the night nudists
A new research being carried out by a company in the Scottish highlands aims to uncover how night-time squirrels use the terrain to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the new findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help protect activities in the future.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual night-time nudists and those called soprano pipistrelles as well as the long-haired coffee and Daubenton nudists in the Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track the activities of the nudes at night throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
The sound analysis that will be carried out by experts for all the recordings will determine the frequency of the sounds of the night nudes and what each species does.
Then, a report and a map of their habitat will be drawn up to give a detailed overview of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the findings will show which habitats are most important for night owls and how they are used by each species.
This information would help to determine the assets of the settlement management, such as the creation of pastures and how to maintain forests for night squirrels and other related species.
The number of night nudists in Scotland and across the UK has fallen sharply over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development works that have an impact on the habitat and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose hazards, such as stickers or chemical components of building materials, as well as pet attacks.
Naked people in the night are not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching and waiting.
They use a sophisticated location-finding technique through sounds to accurately determine insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes night nudes very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly carry out studies, speech inspections and are sometimes involved in rescue programs.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to night owls in Threeave, Dumfries and Galloway, which serves as home to eight of the ten species of night owls in Scotland.
The reserve's administrator, David Thompson, says this place is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a great area for night nudists," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there's still a lot of stuff about the nudes of the night that remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to 'develop'."
He emphasizes the importance of carrying out checks on nudity at night before carrying out property maintenance work because there is a possibility that the unintentional destruction of a nest can kill up to 400 female and young nudity at night, thus exterminating the entire population of the area.
Night owls are protected and killing, harassing and disturbing them or destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee at the Night Nude Conservation Trust, encourages people to become part of the aid.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our night-time nudists and many of our species, we just don't know how their population is moving."
Ronaldo denies accusations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of rape against him were "fake news," saying people "wanted to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he was later alleged to have paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram, directed at 142 million of his followers, just hours after the release of these claims, Ronaldo, 33, described the reports as "fake news."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
"What you said today is false news," said the Golden Ball winner five times in front of the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," he added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these charges, which they have called “unacceptable reports of doubts about privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in value that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is perhaps one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed at Clark County Court in Nevada after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he allegedly raped him in the anus.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said that "99 percent" he is a "good guy" who is left in the mud by "one percent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple had committed sexual intercourse but that it was with the consent of both parties.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because she was "afraid of revenge" and was worried she would be "publicly embarrassed."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to reverse the deal because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer passed to the Italian giants of Juventus in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK will ‘forever regret’ the loss of the status of car manufacturers
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its status as the world's leader in post-Brexit car manufacturing, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border, in the event of a no-deal exit, would cost the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's administrative director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also voiced fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit, it will close its Mini-series factory for a month.
The main concerns relate to what automakers refer to as supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on an "as soon as ordered" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the EU, for custom cars.
If, on March 29, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there may be delays at the border which according to this industry could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory at its factory in Derbyshire for more than a day, the company said, and as a result production will be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's 'Chequers' plan for future relations with the EU "is specifically built to avoid these border checks."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment to also take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we definitely need to be able to continue what has been a fairly successful supply chain."
Toyota couldn't determine how long it would halt production, but in the long run, it warned that the added costs would lower the factory's competitiveness and consequently lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a senior official of the union Unite at the factory, said members are increasingly worried: "In my experience at the time these jobs close, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have set out a rigorous and credible plan for our relationship with the EU of the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "closed for another week" as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and the possibility that the president has obstructed justice.
Discussing whether or not Trump will remove the deputy attorney general from office, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, is something that has created rumors for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein took into consideration putting an interrogator to record talks with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was close to resigning.
Unlike what was expected, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was held at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the hearing held by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have accused him of indecent behavior, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set yet, it could be this week. I think it could be postponed another week considering everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But let's see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not come as a result of dissatisfaction with the attitude of television journalists," although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they attract attention."
Later, she made it clear that there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president performs more quality assurance sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without citing data: "We've seen these figures."
There will continue to be a press conference, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then that's much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions, or press conferences with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are very rare.
The president may have shown the reason for this fact, during this week in New York, where he made a controversial and in some strange cases, in front of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about fears over Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to staff from the EU working at the NHS in Scotland, expressing gratitude on behalf of the country and the desire to remain even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter when it was less than six months since the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in public services at the local level.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations for the UK's departure from the EU have continued, approaching a decision in the fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very troubling time for all of you.
For this reason, I would like to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, increasing the benefits of the patients and communities we serve.
"Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christion Abercrombie underwent an immediate surgical intervention after his head injury on Saturday, in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported The Tennessee journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half.
"He came to the sidelines and crashed there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing it in the barrel and sending it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Hospital Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/scale of the injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He made five interventions on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing the total number of interventions to 18 during the season.
Foreign-born buyers will pay a higher tuition fee when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign national buyers will pay higher tuition fees for the purchase of a property in the UK and the additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new Conservative Party (Tory) plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters.
The tax will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Department of the Treasury plans to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will pay higher tuition fees for the purchase of a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to "target" people with high profits.
The toll will be applied to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, while the additional money will support the government's initiative to combat homelessness.
This extra fee - which adds up to the current pool tax, including the increase in the tax rate introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for rent - can go up to three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts this move will amass up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of London's newly built properties are purchased by people residing outside the UK, which causes price increases and makes it harder for first-time buyers to find accommodation.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign-born buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the toll tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping prices high by buying land but not putting it into use, and called on Ms. May to give up the quotas for affordable homes in order to settle "Britain's shame with properties."
Corbyn has proposed some attractive housing reforms, including rent control and the removal of "no-reason" departures.
Also, he wants to give more power to the advice to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year, I declared that I would dedicate the prime minister's mandate to the return of the British dream - therefore, for a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the problematic home market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair for individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign companies to have it easier to buy houses than British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too difficult to achieve and injustice to homeless people is more than real."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to coach Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in League One (third category), three points away from the head.
He came to the Stadium of Light this summer after returning to St Mirren in the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I was once in representative B and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But as a child I grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it's something that has always attracted me.
However, this opportunity will only come if I am successful in running the clubs."
Ross's predecessors at Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he's not worried he's following in the footsteps of these big names at such a big club, having previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, my success will depend on whether I can return this team to the Premier League?"
"Given the structure and environment of this club, it definitely has a place in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to go there, but I would see myself as successful only if I manage to get the club back into the Premier League."
Ross has only three years since starting his coaching career after a period as assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month term on the Hearts management staff.
He then helped Alloa climb a higher category to the third round of the cup, as well as transforming St Mirren from a club near the fall from the category to the Championship title winners next season.
And now Ross says he feels better than he has ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Perhaps it was really a turning point," he says, about taking Alloa's lead.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, rather than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, I made a good life thanks to this profession, and I enjoyed some good achievements.
Being a player can be difficult.
You have to do a lot of things every week.
Again, I experience a lot of stress and pressure from work but training seems to be the right job.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing something like that. I've never been so good and so myself all my life as an adult."

According to a study, the perfect time to "drink a beer" is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heatwave has boosted local incomes in difficult situations in Britain, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that sales in local and bar groups rose by 2.7 percent in July - but purchases in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, who compiled the data, said: "Continuous sunshine as well as England's participation in the World Cup longer than expected impacted that July followed the same trend as June, where sales of premises increased by 2.8 percent.
The restaurant turnover fell by 1.8% in June, and worsened further in July.
Bars and bars with the main activity of offering drinks recorded the best performance, with higher growth than the reduction of trade in restaurants.
Locals with the main activity of food supply also recognized the decline as a result of the weather with the sun, although not as significant as restaurants.
People just want to go out for a drink.
Sales of beverages at bars and locals increased by 6.6 percent that month, while food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the non-domestic market, the weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent per year will carry a particularly heavy burden considering the continued cost pressure.
"The long and hot summer could not come at a more difficult time for food operators and time will tell if the average August temperatures would give the much-desired calmness."
Total sales growth in venues and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Industry Sales Tracking Index, for the bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry's benchmark.
One in five children have hidden social media accounts that are hidden from their parents.
According to a study, one in five children - some of whom are no more than 11 years old - have hidden social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old students showed an increase in "fake Insta" profiles
This news has increased the fear of posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "main" account that they show to their parents.
One in five children - some of whom are no more than 11 years old - are opening a social media account, which is secretly used by adults.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old schoolchildren showed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" profiles - linked to the photo-sharing site, Instagram.
This news has heightened the fear of posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a clean "main" account that they show to parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally uncovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, found that a teenager was inciting others to "rape them."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's troubling that so many teenagers are trying to create social spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of Athletics in Scotland
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board, as non-executive director of the governing body, during the annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and mayor Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sporting leaders to benefit from her extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
"Elidh enjoys massive respect in the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit tremendously by making that part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to serve as the voice of athletes and I hope very much to contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter race at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, with four Olympic gold medals in total and who is a regular expert at the BBC, lost his ability to walk after a temporary ischemic impact.
He tweeted: "A month ago I suffered a blow.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I'm going to be cured and to what extent.
It took a lot of hard work but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again and today I'm doing skill exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising that compares mothers with cows shares public opinion
A breast pumping company has shared public opinion with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cow feeding.
To launch the promotion of what is considered "the world's first noisy and wearable breast pump," the consumer technology products company, Elvie, released a gastric music video, to promote the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who need to express themselves freely.
Four real mothers dance in a grass-filled cowhouse under the sounds of a song with the lyrics as follows: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't notice, these aren't breasts, it's my chest."
The chorus continues: "Pom-pom, pom-pom, pom-pom, pom-pom, pom-pom, pom-pom, pom-pom, pom-pom, pom-pom."
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it underestimates the "fears" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
"Like us, they should stay 'pregnant' and 'born' to produce milk, only their 'babies' are taken from them a few days after they are born."
Elvie's breast pump is placed inside the receptacles and does not fall into the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It's absolutely traumatic for the mother and the child.
Why don't we use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "What an advertisement with no sensibility."
Others supported the advertisement, among which a woman admitted that the song seemed "too funny."
"I think that's a genius idea.
I would have bought one if you were still breastfeeding the baby.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
It's a bit crazy, but I've seen what it means.
"It's a great product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a gas advertisement addressed to mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and who feel like a "wolf."
This is not an advertisement that evaluates or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they have all danced with the "hidden" pump placed in the recipes.
The concept behind the campaign is based on data that many women who use breast pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is noiseless, has no threads or tubes, is placed inside the receptacles and does not fall into the eye, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even come out while using it.
Ana Balarin, partners and ECD (Creative Executive Director) at Mother commented: "Pumpa Elvis is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative promotion.
By making a parallel between women who want to express themselves freely and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the use of the breast pump and the challenges they face, also showing in a fun and similar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that the pump gives.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has come out on the front page.
During fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly relocated to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children banned has risen even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively the same, partly as a result of rhetoric and strict policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to send children to their supporter.
Typically, most of the supporters have also been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have been afraid to risk their stay in the country trying to apply for a child.
The risk rose in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults from the same family would have to give finger marks, and this data would also be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal precedent.
"About 80 percent of individuals who are supporters or members of the supportive family stay in the country illegally and a large proportion of them are foreign with criminal precedents.
So, we're continuing to pursue these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to housing workers, trying to process children's data faster, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of the detention, and not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear before the immigration judge via video-conferences and not physically, to argue their demand for legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to housing workers and reports received by the system in recent months, the longer children stay banned, the more likely they are to feel anxious or fall into depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more severe in larger environments such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, signs that a child is having difficulty are more likely to be omitted.
They add that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause traumas that many of them already face.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish "invading forces" to withdraw immediately
During his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has already entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces remain on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will act with them in the right way."
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said during the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been evicted from their homes.
"Damascus will continue to fight in this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories of both terrorist groups and of "foreign illegal forces."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions are good for them to return, blaming "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fear" that pushes refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're politicizing an issue that needs to be totally humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political discussions.
The Russo-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal had "clear instructions" and expressed confidence that military attacks would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be exterminated."
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid out the conditions for the government's participation in this committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution," and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump is going to win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberals hope, accusations and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic fund of a presidency in history!"
So far, there's no sign of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during peak hour has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during peak hour, from 1.7 million that was four years ago, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program has reached the top of the cable channel rankings with 3.5 million viewers during major event nights.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor, which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride to Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh," Ms. Scovell told me.
There's a lot of fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if migrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Persecution is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, if you find yourself after six hours watching a panel of experts debating the use of "pacified information" by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's ostrich-skin bomber jacket, worth $15,000, and arrogance.
At least I'll never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he does and what makes it look like a 'reality show' is that you feed on something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about the circulating actors and the unexpected developments of the program.
You can't leave an episode unseen or you'll be left behind.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the weather was sunny and the temperature outside was 80 degrees, outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was hiding inside, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court that depended on the pear thread.
"I remember when we were running all those crazy programs in the past and people were saying, 'This is the last beginning of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside the private sector floods into tight competition for Congressional elections
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is facing a cash flood as a result of the reorganization of electoral zones that forces two officials on duty to compete for the same post.
This recent reorganization in the outskirts of Pittsburgh has set up Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won the post in another area, in special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th area, which has been overrun by the new 17th.
This new division of maps came after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas had been unconstitutionally and unfairly designated in favor of Republicans.
This competition, in the new zone 17, has also prompted a strong confrontation in the funding of campaigns by key party funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for Congressional Campaigns (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee for Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow-leaning victory in March's widely-followed special election for Pennsylvania's 18th constituency.
For more than a decade, that post was held by Republicans and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Politicians see Democrats as an easy favorite.
U.S. Considers Penalizing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little push from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
U.S. State Department officials decided to remove U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were reviewed only for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and support of the economy.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial aid and certain restrictions on visas, would be severe for the Central American country and for its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central American countries pushed for a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being to follow up on a similar meeting last year, an action that was seen as a step forward in efforts to secure peace.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, ending any opportunity to impose penalties on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has planned to give a speech at the conference, which is expected in mid-October, a signal that shows the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned quietly from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no strong messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal discussions, provided their anonymity was preserved.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who also spoke, demanding the right to anonymity.
Study the history.
The next event that is expected to happen could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible impediments from Mr. Trump, for which there is substantial evidence in the public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is moving his investigation to verify whether during his campaign, Mr. Trump has cooperated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes sides, Mr. Trump will have to give an account before this body, at a time when he is preparing to get back in front of voters, and may eventually face an independent jury.
These are a lot if, and I don't want to suggest that the downfall of Mr. Trump - or that of his counterparts in Europe - is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, must make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which accelerate or delay the unstoppable path of democracy.
Currently, Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since the newspaper reported, over the past year, that he had suggested being secretly interrogated by the president, as well as speculating that he was not fit to remain in office.
Rosenstein said the Times article was inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite substantiated allegations of sexual assault and false evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the next election for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassadors' residence where I lived.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table that bears the symbol of the swastika (broken cross).
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna.
On Thursday, the Rangers await Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after a stunning draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a favorable position to qualify in Group G, the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to make his first appearance this season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a push to achieve bigger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the field believing we could get something and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have scored in the end but, overall, I believe the equivalence was a fair result.
Maybe they were better in the first half while we showed up in the second half and we were the best team.
On Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
"I hope we can get three points but it will be a difficult match because they achieved a positive result in their past game, but with the fans supporting us, I'm sure we can go ahead and get a positive result.
"Last year was very difficult, due to injuries suffered and changes at the club but now there is an optimistic factor in this team.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying it very much; the training is going well.
"I hope that we can move forward, put the last season behind us and achieve success."
Women sleep less as a result of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of how we wanted family members to pay attention to them, very few people talked to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talked to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance company Nationwide.
That's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you unless you first tell them your desires.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how to benefit from care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Get your financial advisor as well: The advisor can help you find a way to pay the expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with savings to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance through your assets - as long as you have the money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through an authorization.
Get a health care prosecutor and appoint a trusted person who will supervise your health care and ensure that the experts act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider getting a lawyer for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and will guarantee the payment of bills if you can't do it yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about the allergies and medications you are taking?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial aspect at stake, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"Which drugs will be used?"
Who will take care of the dog?
"Prepare this plan."

Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, while the death toll is expected to rise.
With the communications networks out of operation, assistance workers have failed to receive information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu, which was closest to the 7.5-foot earthquake epicentre.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated following the disaster.
Below are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a region stretching over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regency, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and breaming are the main economic activities of the province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by the tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that hit 14 states, causing 226,000 casualties along the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than half are ace.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds lost their lives on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed the lives of about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai in Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deadly earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, bringing devastation and panic to the people after recalling the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives due to the collapse of buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police, Paul, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and opposition to arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman, known to him, tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up the phone.
Paul is being held at the Mat-Su detention facility and is being held a guarantee in the form of unsecured bonds worth $500, KTUU reported.
According to reports from this network, he appeared in court on Saturday and when asked about the admission of guilt, declared "absolutely innocent".
Paul faces three category A violations, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Category B offence, which is sentenced to a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Paul has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently being investigated by the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and intoxicated gun possession during the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) as a result of service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed on Friday as a result of an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are out of service and the death toll is expected to rise over the coming days.
The quake hit the central part of Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media circulating that show the moment of the hit.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Seek Rare Death Penalty for Terrorist Suspect in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been handed out for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out a terrorist attack on a bike lane along the western highway in Lower Manhattan, traversing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and caused serious bodily harm "intentionally", according to a letter intended to seek the death penalty, filed in the southern district of New York.
According to a court document, both of these charges can be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury put Saipov in front of 22 lawsuits, including eight counts of murder in aid of organized crime, accusations that are often used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack came as a result of "considerable and premeditated planning," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's way of executing the crime as "abhorrent, cruel and moralless."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the letter read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiring and spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
Both of them were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek national, showed no remorse during the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators that he feels good about what he has done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing video of ISIS on his mobile phone.
Police said he had also asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public lawyers, said he was "very disappointed with the prosecutor's decision."
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and non-acceptance of guilt accompanied by life in prison without the possibility of appeal will further increase the trauma caused by these events to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP says Nigel Farage should be placed at the head of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised during a protest at the Conservatives' conference that he would "mobilize the people's army."
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of the eurosceptic - after one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK "would be out" if the Brexit secretary was Mr Farage.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces to join her group has been highlighted by pro-stay conservatives in the EU, who have joined you in another protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is facing difficulties in implementing the compromise plan reached in Chequers, amid the attacks coming from those who want to stay or leave the European Union, as well as the EU itself.
The Allies insisted that it would try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite harsh reactions - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and chaos.
During the departure march, Mr. Bone said he wanted to leave the Chequers deal.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be put in charge and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was at the top, we'd be out now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we have to abandon the Chequers deal."
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be subjugated.
"We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also on the march and told reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers deal is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote, nor is it supported within our party and by the activists who fill the streets and vote for us.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening."
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: "Prime Ministers retain their jobs in cases where they keep their promises."
Farage said during the march that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are thinking of abandoning the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now, this is a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, 'We're not going to let you do something like that.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to force our political class, which is close to abandoning Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until the UK is independent, proud and governs itself."
Meanwhile, they pro-stay marched to Birmingham, before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists held banners reading "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group showed up at the weekend.
Labour supporter Lord Adonis ironized with conservatives about the security issues they had with a "social application" at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can prepare the IT systems and technology needed for Canada plus plus, for open borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's totally a farce.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to "carefully consider" the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "carefully consider the possibility of running for president" after November's election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting in the township, held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a constant critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-directed Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters according to the municipal format, since Trump came to the top.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington and settle the broken government, and that includes putting a woman at the top."
A man has been arrested for the murder of LSU team player Wayde Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the murder of basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested around 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge police department said in a news conference.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the person who appeared there.
Sims, 20, was gunned down and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims died as a result of gunshot wounds to the head," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, carrying a gun, and that he had shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and sent to custody at the police department in the eastern Baton Rouge area.
Sims, 6'6'' long, played 32 games, of which 10 as the title, last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls on the table for matches.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title as team's instructions give victory to Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a significant role in this race.
Bottas started from the first place and almost "punished" Hamilton after defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and left Hamilton to race in "traffic" at the end of the car pile, something that should have turned out decisively.
Mercedes stopped a lap later and was positioned behind Vettel, but Hamilton came out in the lead after several maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave space from within after a double move to defend himself in the third lap.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last row and at the end of the first round ranked seventh, on his 21st birthday.
Then he was at the top of a major part of the race after not changing the tyres to achieve a fast finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen by finishing fourth.
Eventually, he made a stop on the 44th lap but failed to improve the pace in the remaining eight lap, leaving Raikkonen in fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was shown a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these exchanges of positions," Hamilton said.
We use a very weak body language.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump ironized Senator Dianne Feinstein during a rally Saturday over her insistence that she was not the person who "raised out" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing High Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not refer you directly to Ford's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "legal, bad and rude."
"The only thing that can happen and the beauty of what's going on in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at the innate, when you look at people who are angry, law-abiding, bad and insincere," he said.
"When you look at the hidden publications and then the people who say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it myself."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you the one who brought the letter out to the public?
Do you remember her answer... did you get the document out - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, yeah.
I didn't get it out."
Wait a minute.
We didn't take it out...No, we didn't take it out," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford and the document came out early in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't expose her story," Feinstein told the commission.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as she asked me to."
But apparently her denial was not acceptable to the president, who commented during Saturday night's debate: "In my opinion, gestures really left to be desired.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen weaker gestures before."
Taking to the defense of the High Court candidate, who has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said Democrats were using alleged accusations to achieve their goals.
"They are determined to regain power at all costs.
Look at the evil and the ugliness. They don't care who they hurt, who they have to violate to take power and control," reported Mediaite as the words said by the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars compensated for their loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday in the Elite League challenge, winning Saturday's 5-3 return game at Dundee.
The Giants quickly switched to a double advantage thanks to strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score for the home team before Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the win.
This was the third loss of the season, in the Elite League, to the trustees of Adam Keefe, who on Friday evening returned from the draw, to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth confrontation between these teams, this season, with the first three won by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assistant to Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford gave the assistant to Beauvillier, who doubled the score four minutes later.
During an intensive first half, Sullivan returned the locals to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted for Cownie's equalization at 15:16.

The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games on Friday, will play their next home game against Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller loses his life by ensuring that hundreds of people on a plane can escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honored as a hero after losing his life by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely lands.
More than 800 people were killed and many more were declared lost after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to disturb the area and many people have been stranded in the trenches in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to rescue him, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to step down from his post at the control tower that was rocking vigorously at Palouse’s Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stood to ensure that Batik Air's Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could leave safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning, before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We're breaking the news," he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the local disaster mitigation agency says entry to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that this number will continue to rise, as there were still many bodies under the excavation, while others have not been found," said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The dams that reached up to six meters have destroyed Palau, where a massive mortuary ceremony will be held on Friday.
Military planes and merchants are bringing supplies and assistance.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance brings troops every minute.
There is no clean water.
"Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I am asking you to work day and night to carry out any duties related to evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline that headed a plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia has now declared a missing person, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the plane that was diving into the water.
In a press release, Air Niugini said they were not finding a passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been escorted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collision and the consequences of the events themselves remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon after failing to reach the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down too low.
"That's a really good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the level of the belt, he and other people managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, while he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to repair a nearby scaffold helped rescue them, using an airship to transport people ashore before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have lost their lives in PNG-registered airline crashes in the last two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of them.
An analyst builds the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office presented its arguments in the retrial of a person, who is accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi, in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for a few hours, in the quality of the expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used the phone data to reconstruct the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
According to reports from The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that she had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the afternoon of her death, a fact that refutes his previous claims.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers's while he said it was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to the latter.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that night he was in Sanford's truck, the latter said "he's lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is Tellis' statement, which said she had known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that they only had one week to get to know each other.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He took it out of his life," Hale said.
The defending side is expected to give the closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said the jury will take the decision on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A three-member hip hop group seeks to challenge the negative views of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and messages dealing with social issues.
They want to return to the origin and make it known again the conscious hip hop.
In the UK, a rendition of artists such as The Fugees and Common has been noted differently from artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
"Another man of color?"
A New York dad sues the couple for leaving work after receiving a "racist" message.
A New York dad has sued a couple for discrimination in leaving work after receiving a message wrongly sent from a mother who complained she was "another black man."
The couple denied that they were racist, calling the lawsuit a "breakup."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her concern when she discovered that the new dad Giselle Maurice was a black woman, at the time she appeared on the first day of work, in 2016.
"JOOOOOOOOOOOO, THE ONE MAN WITH THE BLACK," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her fork, Plasco-Flaxman, "felt embarrassed" by Ms. Maurice, on the grounds that their current aunt, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead, she wanted a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her single day's work and then sent home with a "pocket in her pocket".
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for leaving work, and is seeking compensation worth $350 a day for a six-month period, for which she was hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to tell them that they shouldn't do things like that," she told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied claims they were racist, saying Maurice's departure was the right move, as they feared they could no longer believe them after they had offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave children in the hands of a person you've been shown rude to, even if wrongly?
Your newborn baby?
Tell me."
Considering the lawsuit as a "detachment," Plasco said he and his wife had given birth to a child two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you take revenge on someone in this situation?"
It's not something positive to be done," added Plasco, an investment banker.
While the case has gone to court, public opinion has quickly denounced the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not make a connection with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
"We are delighted to have seen Paddington's extraordinary success."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, would be saddened if his work was refused, adding that the 60th anniversary of his book's publication last year "came to his death."
As for Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of the success.
"He was a quiet person and I wasn't proud," she said.
"Paddington was so true to it that it was the same as having a successful child: you feel proud of it even though it's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
"Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the merits to Paddington's own character."
My daughter was changing her life and I was forced to say goodbye by phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors had tried to save her life but with no result.
"Nad was calling me regularly to tell me that it was too heavy, that he didn't think it would work out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who told me she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors had given her to keep her heart at work were losing effect and slowly departing from her system.
She had died a few years ago and now everything was "turning off".
I was forced to sit and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and people.
I've got to be strong."
Over time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers - who were unaware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head down and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight I felt a great pity for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who are mourning post letters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted inspiring messages on a bridge in Wales as well as the phone numbers of people who can call them for support.
Mr. Davis's son was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, from Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a "adjacent" smile.
"Everybody knew about his smile.
"People have always said that his smile brightens every room."
However, he quit his job before he changed his life, as he was "in a really dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the person who found his brother after committing suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Ms. Davis created the letters, "that people know that there are people who can help them and with whom they can talk, even with a friend.
"Don't sit alone, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he was feeling upset, depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in behavior.
He was extremely annoyed on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't see them in the eyes and did nothing."
She said his death was a big trauma for them, but that they should overcome: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We've been destroyed.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the plot after the FBI's investigation begins
"I thought if we could give him something similar to what he was looking for - a time- and object-limited investigation - maybe we could bring a little harmony," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "dissolving" amid numerous opponents' hurdles.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation comes as a result of time.
Congressional elections are only five weeks away on Nov. 6 - if Republicans fail, as expected, they will be greatly weakened in efforts to elect the person they want to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying for them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
It will be voted on in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could gather at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to end the situation and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea is falling under Kim's leadership.
The number of defectors in North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Union Ministry in South Korea, said there were about 1,127 desertions last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main factors were the strictest controls at the borders between North Korea and China as well as the higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers.
Penny didn't make any public comments.
The vast majority of deserters from North Korea take their nationalities from South Korea.
Seoul has stated that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them go to China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and there can be more easily crossed compared to the DMZ between the two Koreas, which is protected by multiple forces.
China considers illegal migrant deserters and not as refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Penian and their talks focused on delayed denuclearization negotiations.
The meeting came after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under these circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm first," he said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not worthy to serve in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that because of his temperament, he was incapable of serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman were ever treated like that, people would say 'historic,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very concerned and at some point almost yelled or "mouthed" when talking about his family and his high school years.
He blamed the Democrats explicitly before the committee, calling the accusations against him "a grotesque and coordinated assassination of his figure," organized by liberals angered by the loss of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony constituted evidence that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, after she showed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he penalized himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi dared to answer the question whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a motion of no confidence in the event of his appointment, and if Democrats win most seats in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's unqualified not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the sessions for his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and one-sided person to become a member of the court and expect us to say 'Oh how good!'" he said.
Women need to take advantage of it.
This is a fair verbal attack, months and years of insanity that erupts, and it fails to lead to the end without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What about you?"
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who worked in a managerial position, who expressed that she was also crying when she was angry, but she had created a style that whenever she was angry and started crying, she would say to the interlocutors, "You can think I'm upset and I accept that.
But I'm really infuriated."
And then she kept talking.
I thought it was a brilliant idea."
Tears are a way of expressing anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office dominated by men and where at one point I found myself crying in an unbearable rage, was the moment when an older woman grabbed me by the throat - a chilly manager I knew I had.
“Don’t ever let others see you cry,” she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're bored, and they'll be happy to let you get bored."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his candidacy for President.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the middle of an extramarital affair aboard a boat called "Monkey Business" and was taken out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply indignant, realized that there was no reason not to consider running for president herself.
"This was not a well-balanced decision," she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Since the campaign was in its final stages, it had been behind the fundraiser, so he vowed not to compete if he failed to raise $2 million.
But it was a futile war.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Don't they think they're making me a deal?" she asked herself.
During the speech where she announced that she would not run an official campaign, she was so overflowing with emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, anger at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and highlight voters instead of delegates, and as much sexism.
"It seemed like I had a nervous breakdown," said Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"It looked like Kleenex was my sponsoring corporation.
I remember thinking what people would write on the stone of my grave.
"She's crying"?
The U.S.-China trade war's benefits for Beijing
The first rifts in the trade war between the U.S. and China were deafening, and as the war is far from over, a split between the two countries could provide Beijing with a long-term advantage, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, imposing taxes on major Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most sensitive escalation was this week, when the new tariffs hit goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing has been avenged every time it “in-nature,” ultimately putting tariffs on five to ten percent of over $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has vowed to return the U.S. with the same currency, and the world's second-largest economic power is unlikely to surrender soon.
Withdrawal from Washington would mean surrendering to their demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to publicly bow to the US.
However, experts said that if China plays its cards properly, the pressures coming from the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long term, to reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, made quickly in both Washington and Beijing, can cause economic downturns in each of these countries, is something far more dangerous than what has been seen from the outside," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the American Center for Security Research.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
Already, there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, from where you had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and well-being.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
More than 6 million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated state.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance or conditional assistance from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup trophy in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup trophy after defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 with 10.5, at Le Golf National, out of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive games in European territory and has won this trophy in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the Danish captain's team, Thomas Bjorn, managed to get 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the player who faced the most difficulties during the tournament, led the first shot into the water and closed the 16th hole with 3 shots more than the specified level, losing the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to achieve a 5-0-0 score since the current format began to apply in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup final.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has played in eight Ryder Cups, became the most successful European player of all time in this tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't hold myself today.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very, very happy that we have recovered the cup.
"Success is for the team, and I'm happy that I had the opportunity to help them," Garcia said excitedly after the European team's victory.
He passed the floor to fellow golfer John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in direct challenges on Sunday.
"I feel an extraordinary pride that I defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that player," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now has 13-21-3 statistics, during his career in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, ranking second after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to get the ball to the right place, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing appearance, "I'm proud of these guys. They fought hard.
There were a few moments during this parade when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought hard.
congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
"We will regroup, work with the PGA in America and with our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
"I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be the captain.
We have to take off our hats.
They played better than us."
