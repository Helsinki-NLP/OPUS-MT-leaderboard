Father J<0xC3><0xB3>zef Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He is charismatic.
The crowds are drawn to the Mass of his deliverance and healing.
He was a few years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscans, this is experienced by others.
The Mass of St. Witko for Liberation and Healing is being held by the crowds
Once upon a time, the parents of a 7-month-old child came to him, who had a hole in his heart that was 7.5 mm in size.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
Surprised doctors said: "Operation is not necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm".
My parents were crying with happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The clergyman began to experience the extraordinary actions of the Creator as a teenager.
In dreams, purifying souls came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and inclined to pray for the dead and those who died at that moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost human qualities and began to take on the appearance of an animal," he says.
The invisible force carried him up, he could not get a voice out of himself.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
“Drowned in the waters of the river symbolizing the baptism of the saint, I was freed and returned to the human form...” he says.
He didn’t tell anyone about these strange experiences.
The vocation ripened in him.
He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.
In the sermons he did not just talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
In the healing masses held by his father Witko participates many people who count on getting rid of the disease.
The clergy, however, emphasizes that their main goal is spiritual healing, not corporeal healing.
First defeat of Kolping FRAC Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw
This afternoon (September 26th) Kolping’s FRAC team won the honour of the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of the LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.
The Jaros<0xC5><0x82>awians in such a personal list, which they presented with the villagers, have little chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
It was a good match against Dart Bogora.
The team still lacks a named team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the line-up, the Yaroslavians would have achieved a third successive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet grown up to win with such talents as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, i.e. Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorski Street in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Both in the confrontation with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class by itself.
After three games, Kolping FRAC led 2-1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badowski, and Daniel G<0xC3><0xB3>rak after an exciting, five-hundred-year battle – Pavel Sirucka.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Lea a chance.
There was still hope for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han could not beat Badowski.
There will be no additional research for seniors.
What's wrong?
According to the announcements of Rafael Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive tests for seniors aged 70 and 80 years was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not gained the approval of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs under its control.
In the justification, the agency explained that the target group was mis-selected.
“The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive test result.”
The decision of the tribunal is not understood by the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have the money for it.
Only the government fears that if people are examined, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because it is precisely to lead to a situation where prevention can be done more quickly.
All specialists know that it helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski.
“It’s hard to imagine a professional saying, ‘Don’t be surprised, because there will be longer queues at the doctor’s office, and if such professionals are advising the government, I’m not surprised that the health service is in such a state.’”
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced Thursday at a session of the UN General Assembly that he would break any agreements with Israel if the country’s future government tries to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement of annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
“If the future government of Israel, which will arise, proceeds to implement this plan, we will nullify all the agreements signed (with Israel) and withdraw from all the commitments we have made,” he said.
"We will reject the entire plan completely and completely," Abbas said.
“It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means – no matter what the consequences – by fully engaging in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism,” said the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the former prime minister of Israel, has been given the task of forming a government once again after the September 17 elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and plan to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank in Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the session of the UN General Assembly to hold Palestinian general elections in the lands.
The last one took place in 2006.
“When I return to the country, I will convene local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” he said.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, seen as a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the rights of “full-fledged members of the UN and all its organs and institutions.”
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to “force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations with full respect.”
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, saying the Palestinian leader "would rather focus in the UN on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel than fight against the calls for terrorism in the Autonomy under his leadership."
Danon, however, did not refer to Netanyahu’s announced annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescuers want defibrillators in the Neuralgia Points of Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l
The history of the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save human lives.
The Voivodeship Emergency Station in Przemysl wants such devices to be located in the newralgic points of the city.
For their position, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Voivodeship Emergency Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek W<0xC3><0xB3>jcik are officials of the Podkarpackie Tax Office in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
On August 28, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyka. An officer of the Customs and Treasury Service noticed a man lying unconscious in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist has died in detention as a result of torture.
He wanted to enjoy the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the activist’s wife, was called on September 23 by the Communist Party secretary from her home village to inform her that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
In the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body slaughtered, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood,” she said.
“They didn’t let me take my cell phones with them, and there were a lot of police around who couldn’t get close to Wang.”
Police pressed her to sign a statement saying her husband had been seriously ill and had died as a result of an “unfortunate accident”.
PLN 105 million for companies in the video game industry from the National Center for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of the funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN program on Friday.
Among almost 30 projects, which was supported by NCBR, the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on the AR game engine, which creates a map of the real world together with an application that allows the transmission of data by users, among others, was the development of a platform for the testing and training of skills.
The aim of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market in the perspective of 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
"Specially prepared GameINN research agenda and already reaching PLN 300 million in support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral program constitute an important impetus for the further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedevu," the statement reads.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential that we have in Poland.
“Incentives introduced by the government for innovating entrepreneurs, such as R&D concessions, competency improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by NCBR, drive the innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market, a highly competitive market, and a high level of innovation,” he said.
The head of the science department points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets – from the relief for R&D in 2018, three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited than a year earlier.
“The amount of deducted costs for R&D activities was PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in more than PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by NCBR in three editions of GameINN,” the Deputy Prime Minister underlines.
Director of NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki recalls that 78 innovative projects were awarded in the two previous funding competitions with a total value of more than PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest in the III competition and the diversity of applications show that the video game industry has the ideas and competencies to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“It is particularly gratifying that, as in previous editions, there are projects for solutions not only for entertainment, but also for Industry 4.0,” he adds.
Entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million in the third GameINN competition.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of about PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were granted almost PLN 105 million in funding.
Detailed information on the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented as part of the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confesses to the theft of Kasper Dolberg's watch
The incident took place on September 16.
Dolberg, who arrived from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not exactly, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Dane the next day did not appear at the classes, explaining stomach problems.
The case was mysterious from the beginning.
The players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadig finally confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Danes to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young players in France.
He came to Nice at the age of thirteen to make his debut in the first team three years later.
He has played in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – as reported by the newspaper “L’Equipe” – the club will probably dissolve it with immediate effect.
So far, he has started disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it the right way.
This is especially important now that autumnal infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
But most of us are short-sighted.
Just warm water and ordinary soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against them).
While washing, we wipe not only the bottoms and tops of the hands, but also: the tips of the fingers (joined or individually) – rub them with circular movements with the inside of the second hand, the spaces between the fingers (spread your hands, rubbing your fingers around each other), the thumbs and thumbs in the palm of each thumb.
In an emergency situation (when you can not wash your hands), you should wipe your hands with a wet wipe, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 PLN).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the doors or doors (recommended by the General Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them with a paper towel.
Iran's President Says He Rejected U.S. Talks, Donald Trump Denies
Tehran did not enter into talks with the U.S. during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the U.S. offering to lift the sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rowhani said on Friday.
US President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, the U.S. has proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for starting negotiations on a new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear program and the ballistic missile program.
Rowhani: Iran will not take talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
Iran's president said he did not agree to the talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He said he had met with U.S. diplomats because he had been persuaded by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of “maximum pressure”.
“And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in a 5+1 format, no one is able to predict what the end result will be,” Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the U.S., and accused European parties of favoring U.S. sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrew from the nuclear deal “are a precondition that does not allow” for the establishment of dialogue.
“If we manage to put an end to this precondition and if America puts an end to sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,” he said.
He added that he does not rule out a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation last week at the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump tweeted that he was the one who rejected the request of the Iranian side.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
“Of course I said ‘no!’” the US president tweeted.
Tension with the nuclear agreement in the background
France, Germany and the UK are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow save the 2015 agreement with Iran, which they were signatories to.
It meant that in exchange for lifting economic sanctions, Iran would renounce its nuclear weapons program and subject the nuclear sector to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the United States from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
So far, none of this has worked out.
Washington is applying a tactic of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a permit to export raw materials, it will limit its commitments under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the jailer Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsApp, participated in stalking the judges, was reinstated on Wednesday for judgment by the NSA.
The reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, and therefore there is no reason to support WSA President Wojciech Mazur’s order to remove him from office.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman for the NSA, initiated an explanatory proceeding against Smydt in late August, but it has not so far turned into a proceeding against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must deal with the decision of the president of the WSA within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly spoke about his wife’s mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the office of the KRS due to suspicions of participation in the heretical group, will return to the verdict and will issue sentences on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Smydt denies his participation in the haether group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this except for the fake screens and the words of his wife, whom he is divorcing.
Exactly the same is said by the other judges associated with the caste: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it is quite possible that they will bet on their own.
Because the prosecutor's office did not waver to secure the evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of the phone Emilia Szmydt, who stopped the phone in June in another case.
The police did not nod their fingers to secure the devices of the people whom they identified as persecutors in a February report by Judge Waldemar <0xC5><0xBB>urek.
There is no evidence – there is no Smydt case, there is no “Cast” case.
There is also no case of NIK chief Marian Banasio about renting a building to basements and hiding income.
The CBA checks his financial statements.
And he'll check when he checks.
And the Committee on the Ethics of the People’s Republic of Banas will not deal with it, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee on State Control has somehow come together to make a curious decision to dismiss Banasi’s deputies and appoint her as his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American one, about how a wife comes home and finds her husband with a mistress in bed.
She's so stunned and devastated that she can't utter a word.
She stands in the door of the homeless woman, and at this time the mistress quickly jumps out of the bed, dresses and leaves.
And the husband was putting on the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and shouts: What is it?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: What woman, darling?
Except that in the case of "Casta" or Banasia there is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.
MAXIPIZZA: Signing of the agreement with the auditor for the examination of the financial statements for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021.
The Management Board of Maxipizza S.A. informs that on September 27, 2019, it signed an agreement with Premium Audit Sp<0xC3><0xB3><0xC5><0x82>ka z o.o. with a registered office in Pozna<0xC5><0x84> at Czartoria 1/1, entered under the number KRS 0000540136 in the register of entrepreneurs of the National Court Register in Wydzi<0xC5><0x84>, Kraj<0xC5><0x84>ski District Court in Powywny
The subject of the agreement is the examination of the financial statements of Maxipizza S.A. for the following financial years: a. from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019, b. from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020, c. from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021.
Kamila Li<0xC4><0x87>vinko in the final jump up
Earlier this season, returning to the competition after a maternity break, the bronze medalist of the World Championships in London 2017, in the first try she defeated 1.85 and 1.89 and in the second 1.92.
1.94 was only achieved in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I can fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final I will have to jump better technically," Li<0xC4><0x87>winko admitted in front of the Eurosport camera.
American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karyna Demidik were the best in the eliminations – after 1.94.
Both players were the only ones who didn’t fall any heights.
The women’s finale is scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7.30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in a serious condition
He went to the hospital, and the doctors describe his condition as severe.
It must be said that he is conscious and conscious.
“We believe that it will come out that he will win again.
We all pray that he will recover,” said an anonymous close person, Kornela Morawiecki, in a conversation with the journalists of “Super Express”.
In the upcoming election, the prime minister's father is running for the Senate.
“My life is held by my closest family and my closest politician,” Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to Super Express journalists two weeks ago.
In January, Super Express reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki was admitted to the Military Hospital in Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and I went to the hospital.
Turns out I have a jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When a CT scan was done, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...", the Prime Minister's father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, priest Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know a lot of people have been praying for me, for which I am very grateful.
Fortunately, I don't have any metastases.
I still don't know if I'm going to get chemotherapy.
I give myself into the hands of medical professionals who are rather good at thinking.
For now, after this heavy operation, I have to go back to some state of usability.
I hope that everything will be all right," Morawiecki said in January in an interview with SE.
“If I were too late to get tested, the situation would be tragic and I’d say goodbye to this bastard,” he added.
Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w: 14-year-old girl is missing
Officers from the Municipal Police Command in Cracow are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stok<0xC5><0x82>osy.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is requested to contact us.
The missing woman left her home on the evening of September 26 and has not returned or made contact with relatives to date.
She was last seen at Stary Go<0xC5><0x9B>ciniec Street in Krakow.
Nel Stoh<0xC3><0xA1>sa is 14 years old, measures 167 cm, has blond hair and blue eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in a blouse, gray pants and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is requested to contact the police at tel. no. 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of Olav's jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, may be confusing for some.
To the true power, the road is far, but this is the name of one of the types of horse competition...
The competition for the power of jumping consists in the overcoming by the rider and the horse of ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding here that the long-standing and still unbroken world record, established in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local Amazons at 135 cm level is also one of the worst...
The competitions organized by the untiring Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists “In the saddle”, were a showpiece of the “Rainbow Riding Competitions”, which we write more extensively in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight Amazons, training horse riding in the O<0xC5><0x82>awsk JKS, entered the competition.
Four competed on dicks, and four on big horses.
In the first group was best written Nikola Szoldra, arriving crazy "Sprinter".
This small but dynamic rumbling began with overcoming obstacles spread out at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and it was only after three consecutive refusals that the jury of the competition suspended him from further competition.
The second place in the jumps of puppies was occupied by Amelia Pawlak, who reached "Famy", and the third by Lena Boru<0xC5><0x84> on "Harmider".
Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles on the small duck "Carmen".
Even greater emotions accompanied the starting Amazons and viewers during the competition with the participation of large horses.
Terrible-looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, who received the "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding the "Fly".
Thankfully, apart from the minor defeats of the Amazons and the horses, nothing bad happened, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young duck "Wineta" to the park had the approaching Weronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz.
She needed either the coach’s assistance, or another horse for the couple, after which the somewhat crazy “Wineta” moved.
After completing the obstacle from the parkour, she also went down in full splendor, so it was dangerous at times in the boxing and at the stretcher. "Everything is under control!", reassured Jan Sienkiewicz a little frightened viewers, especially the youngest.
From the beginning of the competition of large horses, Marta Masalska was very good at the park, arriving at the beautifully presented "Whisky".
This dignified duck, coupled with an experienced Amazon, followed the second approach in the final stage as the first to jump 135 cm and this was the best result of the competition at the time.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk on the "Declaration", Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz on the "Wine" and Anastasia Abramenko on the "Fly".
For the decoration of the flo and after receiving prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these players left together, and in the end together with the Amazons on puppies in the rhythm of the Radecki march made an impressive honorary round, finishing with it these interesting and exciting competitions.
Thank you.
The Equestrian Sports Club "W Siodle" warmly thanks the sponsors of the jump power competition during the XVI "Rainbow Riding Competitions": the City Office in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, the Water and Sewerage Plant in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, the Provincial Municipality and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko cuts off from KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
The KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which Mariusz Max Kolonki’s #R Revolution political formation was to go to the parliamentary elections in October.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections Kolonko announced cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Pavel Kukiz, but none of these coalitions occurred, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko was not even able to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any district.
Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he has ended his cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I will expect from w/w KWW to delete my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to connect my person with the mentioned entity," he added and announced that more information will be provided soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his work or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, on American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko in the United States announced the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and the world.
“We’ve had enough of politicians, we’ve had enough of your stupid games, we’ve had enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the state to embrace the nation and rule for the good of the nation," Kolonko said at the time.
The party’s program included issues related to the judiciary (should be elected in the general elections), tax changes (equalization of the amount of tax-free for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for the Eastern flank of NATO, with special reference to the Polish elections), and the special reference to the Polish elections.
A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political formation Mariusz Max Kolonko began to talk with Marki Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his social media profile suggesting that #R will join forces with the Kukiz’15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions ultimately took place.
UBS: Gold near equilibrium
“The euro exchange rate will continue in the coming months around the PLN 4.35 ceiling, which will be accompanied by a weak economy in global markets,” says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a solid economic growth rate and stable monetary policy speak for the stabilization of the gold prices at the current ceiling," the specialist assesses in a conversation with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are mitigating policies.
“If the zloty is properly valued – the euro’s quotations should continue in the coming months around the PLN 4.35 ceiling – Polish bonds are not attractive enough, according to him.
Bonds from emerging markets offer much more favourable returns than Polish securities,” says Michael Bolliger, Head of Asset Allocation to Emerging Markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world economy.
“The global slowdown may deepen further, but there should not be a severe recession, and at the very highest, a downturn in GDP dynamics slightly below zero,” says Michael Bolliger.
Investors should be wary of global actions that may be hurt by a lack of prospects for a U.S.-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the impeachment of Donald Trump and Brexit.
Europe should be the weakest among the stock markets,” according to the latest investor letter from UBS Wealth Management chief executive Mark Haefele.
“Equity shares from euro area countries should behave worse than US stocks because they are more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of slowing down,” the document reads.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hospice in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of German 10-year-olds even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, in the long term, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term, due to the mitigation of banks’ monetary policies.
The Fed has the largest field of rate cuts, which should lead to the weakening of the US currency in the coming years.
The long-term equilibrium point for euro quotations is a cap of $1.29, which would mean a 19 percent potential to strengthen the common currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed rates, which will result in a reduction in the differences in monetary policy in the world.
“To maintain the strength of the dollar in the long term may not allow current account and budget deficits,” says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr loses its weapons.
Confidential report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has reported the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 pieces of weapons and 19,445 pieces of ammunition – according to a confidential summary prepared by the RFN defense department.
This was reported by the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the parliamentary office of the Secretary of State at the MON Peter Tauber (CDU), it has so far been possible to retrace two pieces of weapons, one part of weapons and 3474 pieces of ammunition.
Among the military equipment that remains missing are six MG3 universal machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 luf is missing for MG3 machine guns.
Martina Renner, vice-president of the Left Party, expressed concern about the situation.
As she told RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “threatening.”
All the more so, as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as “a miserable balance.”
She also criticized the fact that it does not appear from the summary whether there is a weapon that was found in the investigation against the lieutenant of the Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a severe act of violence that threatens the security of the state.
The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians for far-right and racist reasons.
His “black list” of goals, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor’s office, included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas from the SPD, Claudia Roth from the Greens and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally entered the possession of four pieces of firearms, more than 1,000 pieces of ammunition and more than 50 explosive charges.
Crying kids on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines has recently been using a feature designed for people for whom traveling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the distribution of seats in the aircraft.
If a minor travels to the second year of age, the "child icon" appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place far from that occupied by the toddler.
The BBC reports that the airlines have already reported the imperfection of the solution.
The "child icon" will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a change of plane at the last moment.
As you might expect, the idea was shared by the Internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, and we used to be.
“We need to learn tolerance because we will soon need a map of places where people can breathe, spit, or drink,” G Sundar said.
Another Internet user noted that he was once bothered by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also a lack of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“I thank you for warning me of the screaming children on the 13-hour journey,” Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Majorca counts losses after Thomas Cook’s travel agency goes bankrupt
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive for a holiday to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
According to the representative of the Balearic Autonomous Government Marc Pons, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly related to Thomas Cook, such as the company Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected holidaymakers who had to give up their holidays in Majorca next month due to the bankruptcy of a British company are citizens of Germany and the Scandinavian states.
However, according to Pons, given that Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island between November and April, the losses to the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Balearic government has already begun negotiations with international operators on the “entry to the Mallorcan market” after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the newspaper Diario de Mallorca, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.
About 800 are laid off employees of the Thomas Cook office in Palmyra.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with Thomas Cook declaring bankruptcy in many hotels in Majorca, property owners demanded that guests pay an additional fee per night.
This situation was experienced, among others, by several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, several dozen hotels in Majorca had ceased operations until at least the end of October in connection with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and the companies cooperating with him.
On Friday, the Diario de Ibiza reported that most of the hotels in Ibiza that have worked with Thomas Cook have not been able to cope with the closures in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel agency.
They revealed that the most injured tourists on this archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.
According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook owes about 5 million euros to local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019.
FIFA Women's Ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, USA at the top
The Polish women’s national team is ranked 29th in the ranking of the International Football Federation (FIFA) published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Mi<0xC5><0x82>osz St<0xC4><0x99>pi<0xC5><0x84>ski was classified in the previous, July list.
Weak team matches.
How will it be in October?
The leaders were the American women who recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, while the third place was held by the Dutch.
Poles are preparing for the ME qualification.
They were scheduled to start their match against the Czechs on 3 September.
The day before the meeting, due to food poisoning of the opponents, it was postponed for a year.
In this situation, the Poles will inaugurate the qualification meeting with the Spaniards on November 12 in Lublin.
Earlier, “White-Red” will play two social matches – on October 3 at the departure from Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group of rivals Poles are the national teams of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the top three teams from second places advance directly to the final tournament.
The other six teams from the second position will play in the barracks with the last three passes to the European Championships.
The rate of 16 participants will be supplemented by the host – England.
The Polish men's national team in the September FIFA rankings fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog overthrew the government
“The effects of the Clean Air program are negligible, and coal stoves will be burning this winter as if nothing ever happened,” reads the front page of today’s Rzeczpospolita.
So far, 82,000 applications for a total of PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the Clean Air Programme, of which 48,000 have been positive.
The accepted proposals amount to a total of over PLN 915 million," Rz said, citing data from the environment minister's spokesman.
As the newspaper notes, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the program.
The results of the suspiciously announced program are assessed by the journal as "modest".
The self-governance, quoted by “Rz”, will look for the failures of “Clean Air” among others in too large bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by mail, possible random control of implementation.
This would improve operations," says Mayor of Lidzbark Warmi<0xC5><0x84>ski Jacek Wi<0xC5><0x9B>niowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of operation, less than 1% of the target of replacing 3 million boilers was achieved.
As “Rz” notes, although the budget of the program is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year, 1.4 billion zlotys have been reserved,” we read.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak: Now price negotiations
The U.S. Congress has approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before concluding the contract, but it is not the end of our work,” Mariusz B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak wrote on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard in order to achieve the best possible price,” the Polish minister added.
Agreement on the Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force is targeting 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the U.S. State Department agreed to their sale to Poland.
The statement stressed that the investment will support the national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of NATO’s ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for fighter jets.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, the provision of engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics support and program and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets
The F-35 Lightning II produced by Lockheed Martin is a single-seat, single-engine, fifth-generation multi-role fighter.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out close support missions, bombing and typically fighter air combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for near-range radars.
The F-35 jets were recently purchased by Belgium under a contract worth $4.55 billion.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16s.
Other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, will also consider purchasing U.S. fighter jets.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
This is how we fight stereotypes.
Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
In addition to Barbie with different skin colors, figures or hairstyles, Mattel has introduced gender-neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the series "Creatable World" wear wigs.
Therefore, children can decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys from girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothing.
It was also abandoned to emphasize the characteristic sexual characteristics – gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and a slim waist or – in the case of Ken – broad shoulders.
The company believes that children don’t like it when their dolls have gender norms imposed, and some parents and feminists are convinced that gender-specific toys inhibit girls’ ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will make all children feel free,” says Mattel.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in swimwear and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as the unnatural proportion of the body.
The company has reacted to criticism and has already introduced dolls of different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes, to the market.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: circle or club Together can have several members
Zandberg asked on ZET radio how many candidates his party can get to the Sejm from the lists of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the list is launched by candidates for the Sejm SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the joint logo "Left"), replied that it depends on the result.
“I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people are hoping that the Left is not only right, but also strong,” he said.
According to Zandberg, it follows that the left can have 60-80 members.
“This may mean that the club or club together will have a dozen members.
But it depends on the Poles and the Poles.
I will not guess and say how it will happen," he said.
Asked if the Left will have a separate circle together, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles, because we showed that by differing, we were able to agree on a common program."
Asked if the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is SLD leader W<0xC5><0x82>odzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are the centre-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, noting that the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, he replied that "the aim of the political party is to represent its constituents".
Zandberg has admitted that he will vote for himself in the Sejm elections.
In the case of the Senate elections, he noted that he is considering.
“The offer is diverse and there are candidates in this offer to whom my heart is closest, but there are also those to whom my heart is farther away,” he said.
"I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in the 44th district of the Senate, I would take the ballot and vote in another district," he said.
“I don’t think I would be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (a KO-PAP candidate),” he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leader of the citizens of the Republic of Poland Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS will start.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa has been opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered to be the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, car and on foot in the Bopp district, where a new mosque was built that could accommodate 30,000 worshippers.
The facility was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, belonging to the Sufi Islamic mainstream, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wetland area of six hectares, handed over by the government.
The name of the mosque Massalikul Jinan ("The Paths to Paradise") comes from the title of the poem of Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the nineteenth-century founder of the fraternity, worshiped by followers as a saint.
The mosque is lined with quarry marble and has five minarets.
The highest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque in the center can accommodate 15,000 believers, and the second can be on the outer esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.
Builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building still has no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 worshippers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
The government, in addition to land, has funded lighting, sanitation and roadworks worth 10.5 million euros.
Coach Smy<0xC5><0x82>a: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
The pass of eight league matches without a victory the Crown players try to break in a Friday meeting with the vice-president of the extra-class Silesia.
“Our problem is not Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play,” Kielce coach Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
The last Crown players and the only victory in the league so far recorded in the first row, when they defeated the Beniamin of the competition Rak<0xC3><0xB3>w Cz<0xC4><0x99>stochowa 1:0 on the way out.
Later, they scored two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zag<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>bi Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup game the players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to rebound.
Their fall into the masonry after the last whistle did not result from the collapse, but it was a fall in anger because they were so close,” Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why the team will be sensitive to play in the lateral sectors of the court.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play,” added the coach.
In the Friday match in Korona will certainly not play a pause for the excess of yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic, the staff will also miss the injured Jakub <0xC5><0xBB>ubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
What is building is the participation of several players in the cup game with the desire to play.
“We have a headache, recently it seemed like it wouldn’t be there, and now it is,” Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the pass of eight league matches in a row without a win, while in the extraclass anyone can win with anyone.
“We are a good team.
In the last few weeks, we may not be showing it on the pitch, but the moment will come when we will win and we believe it will be on Friday."
After nine queues of the extra class, the Crown with the achievement of five points occupies the 15th position.
Silesia has accumulated 12 more and is in second place.
The Friday game in Kielce will start at 20.30.
These trees could disappear completely from Europe.
“42% of the tree species that make up Europe’s forests are endangered,” warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the “Red Book of European Trees” published on Friday.
At the top of the list are, among others, chestnuts and buckwheat.
IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was compiled by experts who, based on research, concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) 42% are “highly endangered”.
Among the causes, the Red Book lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As for the typical European tree species, according to IUCN experts, 58% of species are at risk, and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the exploitation of trees, accelerated urbanization, too intensive felling of trees, and subsequently forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and bushes is also at great risk.
“The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual extinction of European plant species and pose a risk of extinction in Europe of important and underestimated varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet,” Luc Bas, who heads the European IUCN office, said in a statement.
I don’t promise 600+.
“Today PiS wants to bribe the Poles, offering them for freedom a distribution on a loan that future generations will have to repay,” says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for Rzeczpospolita.
In his opinion, “the whole policy of PiS is a pic”.
At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken away.”
Schetyna assures in conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It is about mobilizing the electorate at the polls.
According to him, the opposition has more potential in this regard than Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski’s party.
“Today there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than there are supporters of the PiS, a party that has misrepresented values such as modesty, humility, transparency,” Schetyna says.
The Leader of the Citizens’ Coalition and the President of the Citizens’ Platform also highlighted the basic assumptions of the KO election program.
“First of all, nothing will be taken from the data, but it is necessary to set a direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about “launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably – and those who are entrepreneurial”.
Schetyna explains that in the KO program there was a project, which will give the least-earning Poles more than PLN 614 per hand, and more earners – also several hundred.
The politician also said that he did not want to compete for distribution.
As he said, he will do as much as he can, but he doesn’t promise 600+.
“I will never allow for a Greek option, where the rulers were bidding with the opposition on the distribution until finally the financial collapse of the country,” he said.
Schetyna also stated in an interview with Rz that Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-Blo<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“We would hate their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
“The push goes before it falls.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski is such a state man as Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is crystal," he added.
The PO leader also said that he has not yet decided whether to apply for the platform’s chairmanship.
Argentina: Six dead condors of the greats
Six large condors have been found dead in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, according to TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
The large condors were probably poisoned with a means of killing predators such as pumas, foxes or wild dogs.
Animals could have eaten a poisonous trap.
Apart from one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
“It’s a big loss for the environment, because a condor needs to reach 10-15 years to become fertile and capable of breeding.
So we are losing the protected species, the endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think the use of toxic bait and poison not only puts this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work was underway to award the head of state a valuable chain.
The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Duda – we read in “Rzeczpospolita”.
As the newspaper explains, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Republic.
The last time it was probably used by President Ignacy Mo<0xC5><0x9B>cicki.
"Rz" says that soon such a chain could hit the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday on a proposal to start work on the amendment of the law on orders and awards in order to restore it.
The newspaper writes that this is also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was rejected by one vote.
This time the work is quick.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, recognizing that they would seek the opinion of the President's Office.
This one came in mid-September.
“I kindly inform you that the President’s Office does not comment on the position presented in this petition,” Presidential Minister Andrzej Dera wrote at the time.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the matter.
“The President’s office has responded to us briefly: it is in favour of restoring it,” said the head of the commission, Robert Mamatov from PiS, quoted by Rz.
He submitted a request for legislative work, which the committee supported.
Police officers will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection
The political action will be carried out, among other things, at the intersection of al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>ski and al. Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski.
Uniform actions have something to do with the recent complaints of the city authorities against drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, 27 September, police officers begin preventive activities in Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w “Transit Crossings”.
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: entering at the intersection without the possibility of descent, not applying to light signals or road signs.
“We often think we’re alone at a crossroads, and we’re actually making life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobi<0xC5><0x84>ski, the city’s vice president, a few days ago.
His words were echoed at a press conference in the town hall, where the city authorities presented examples of improper movement of cars along the intersections, which as a result creates traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travelers to be sensible on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not to write SMS while driving.
The theme was taken over by the police officers of the district, who are starting the action “Transit Crossings” from today.
What's going on?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting traffic at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a frequent offense that contributes to the strengthening of obstacles in movement and the formation of traffic jams.
A fine of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points is at risk.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and improper parking at intersections.
They will also observe a lack of driving fluidity, late movement under the traffic lights, slow crossings and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
At what crossroads will action be taken?
Among others, on Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellonianska Street; al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>skiego Street from Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski Street; Targowa Street from Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski Street; <0xC5><0x9A>reniawit<0xC3><0xB3>w Square from D<0xC4><0x85>browski Street or Hetmanska Street from Warsaw Uprising Street.
Such actions in the capital of Podkarpatia will be carried out on the following Friday of October.
They inspected a company that disposes of waste from "Czajki"
"Officers of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Municipality of Wo<0xC5><0x82>omi<0xC5><0x84>ski County and the Provincial Construction Supervision Inspectorate on Friday inspected an installation in the municipality of Zielonka, in which waste from the "Czajka" sewage treatment plant in Warsaw is being disposed of," the spokesman said.
Inspectors from the municipality of Wolomin carried out an inspection in the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
Private Commercial and Transport Plant "Dar-Trans", under the agreement with the capital sewage treatment plant "Czajka" provides sewage waste management services.
“The installation was inspected and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his activities,” Szyszko said.
He added that the post-control report will be sent, among other things, to the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last check in “Dar-Trans” was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw between December 29, 2015 and February 11, 2016.
It was then determined that the company did not perform sampling, measurements and groundwater testing, and also did not have the results of tests of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the sewage treatment plant "Czajka".
After the inspection of WIO<0xC5><0x9A> Dariusz Sobota was called to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies that collects waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the sewage treatment plant "Czajka".
According to the decision to conduct waste disposal at the production site, waste weighing up to 60,000 tons per year is processed in the forests near Zielonki.
The Warsaw Municipal Water and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that STUOS was excluded from operation at the turn of November and December 2018, which was related to damage to one of the combustion plants.
As reported by MPWiK, the monthly cost of their export is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa supported Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my total support,” Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa told Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska on Friday.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me,” replied the candidate of the Citizens’ Coalition for Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, he is now “only a retired fan”.
Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska met with former President Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk on Friday.
Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa’s son, Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw, also took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
“You have taken on a difficult task,” Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa said after the meeting.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems before Poland are known to us all.
Therefore, there is great hope that you as a woman will cope with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support your actions as much as possible,” the former president said, referring to Kidawa-Blo<0xC5><0x84>ska.
Very important words.
Kidawa-Blo<0xC5><0x84>ska thanked for the support.
"Mr. President, these are very important words to me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the Constitution and know how important it is," she said.
“Let’s show that you can make a different, wise policy, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland,” Kidawa-Blo<0xC5><0x84>ska stressed.
Retirement Kibic
Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa, speaking to reporters, said he was now “just a retired fan”.
“Of course I look at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, proven, (to that) we will return.
The trinity of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are indispensable.
And all this needs to be cleaned up, all this needs to be restored to normal operation and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then the street criterion awaits us," Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa said.
“That’s why it’s so important that Poles go to the elections, think about it and make their own decisions.
And that is the most important thing," added Kidawa-Blo<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“The last chance that we will improve the situation in Poland with a card,” the former president replied.
“We need to build a new foundation.”
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said: "The President said very well.
We have to build a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If there is no tripartite power, if the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move forward."
Slovenia – Poland 3-1 in the semi-finals.
On the hot ground in Ljubljana, the Polish grid fighters fought the Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
There was no shortage of controversy and discussion with the judges, with Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
"White-Red" lost 1:3 and will play for a bronze medal.
The Senate has passed key laws.
The Senate passed, without amendments, a law on the disclosure of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important people in the state.
52 senators voted for the amendment of the law on the property of the families of state officials - without amendments -, 14 were against, three abstained.
In the same way, the senators decided to reject the 12 amendments submitted during Wednesday’s debate by Senator PO S<0xC5><0x82>awomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were to "civilize" the law and limit the scope of information given in the statement about the property situation of their own children, the children of the spouse, children adapted to cases in which the children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make a statement.
The law on the disclosure of the families of the most important state officials, the draft of which was created in the Prime Minister's office, was passed by the Sejm on September 11.
The regulations assume that, among others, the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members, MEPs, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons who are at the head of other state institutions, will be obliged to place the persons in the declaration and the property information.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on flights of the most important people in the state.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the state.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Register of Flights.
55 senators voted against the bill, 12 against, and four abstained.
According to the law, each flight of the president will be a flight "executed in an official mission".
During the flights, the President may be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the President.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight “taken in order to carry out tasks directly related to the function carried out”.
The law also specifies the list of people who can accompany the most important people in the state during the flight.
According to the regulations, members of the delegation may be on board the aircraft – invited members, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational support; and journalists.
According to the law, in case of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for their explanation.
If such doubts are not clarified in due time, the head of the KPRM shall be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm or Senate of the inability to organise such a flight.
The New Commissioner for Sport
Waldemar Paluch appointed his representative for physical culture, sport and tourism.

After the first training in Paris, the Poles are waiting for the last rival
Polish netizens held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will play a bronze medal match on Saturday.
Vital Heynen’s caregiver closed the way to win the title Thursday’s defeat against the Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their troubles with the trip to this duel.
This time it went without such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenians on a charter to Paris, and a few hours later they held a training in the famous Berca hall.
According to the reports of the people present at the classes, the trainer of the world champions was underestimated.
As Heynen’s assistant Micha<0xC5><0x82> Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of mesh elements.
“We went to the hall, but for the most part it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team,” he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought to the ground.
Without a doubt, we are disappointed.
We always thought we’d come back to this game.
We discussed this match with each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would point to inefficiency in the attack and much worse than usual dealing with situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this regard," he said.
In his opinion, the "White-Red" did not get in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by a loud and numerous audience.
He admitted that the world champions could have fallen asleep a little bit smoothly the way to the semi-finals.
“Perhaps if we had failed in a similar way in the group stage, we would have analysed the lesson faster and then played in the next stage of the tournament.
“It’s just a matter of time,” he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat to the Poles will turn into aggression in a match for bronze.
“I hope that we will show our true face.
There's a lot to fight for.
We won the medal in 2011,” he said.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group stage they went to Apeldoorn, and in the semi-final they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment, but suspended
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine — in a six-month suspension — for defamatory words, gestures and actions during recent ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour operators are losing patience with Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the crimes of the most uncircumcised professional tennis player in recent years looks threatening – 16 weeks off plus a heavy fine, but both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period during which the stubborn athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been working hard for a long time and has made a tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on the court and next to it.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the judge and viewers, breaking two rockets during a losing match with Karen Chaczan – all after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati he paid $113 thousand.
He also did not play for long at the 2019 US Open, but was able to publicly say that the ATP activists were “corrupted”, which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and, after a few weeks, delivered the said verdict on the suspension of starts and another fine.
However, the words about corruption were forgiven him, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the speech.
In the justification, tennis activists said, however, that the investigation showed that Kyrgios’s behavior over the past 12 months has in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules that he repeatedly vulgarly insulted people associated with tournaments and viewers, hence the high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering the fulfillment of several conditions in the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer in any way violate the rules of the code of conduct in force.
He was also recommended to seek “continuous support” from mental trainers during tournaments and also outside the season consulted with people specializing in solving problems of athletes not coping with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgios’ first comment on the verdict was: “Hey everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that’s all.”
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, as his shoulder injury in the Lavera Cup intensified, so he had to give up the upcoming starts in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
Kyrgios is ranked 27th in the ATP rankings.
He won two tournaments this year – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: Living better and better in Poland
A report on household budgets published by the GUS on Friday shows that 44% of households rated their material situation as good or rather good.
A year earlier this percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5 percent, and earlier – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessments of the situation of households – it never exceeded 30 percent.
A total of 8.1 percent of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2 percent a year earlier and more than 20 percent in 2009.
The best is the material situation of the households of the self-employed.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
On the second pole are households of pensioners, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a big impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst result is for single parents, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage ranges (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among the childless households it is 48.8%.
The effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible in these statistics.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst assessment of their material situation was made by parents raising offspring alone and multi-child families (with at least three children).
The improvement of the subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
This is not all, however, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good is growing faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of the voivodeships there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are made by the inhabitants of the Opole province, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
The Lubuskie Voivodeship (47.7%), Silesian Voivodeship (47.6%), Mazovian Voivodeship (47.3%) and West Pomeranian Voivodeship (47.1%) are still included.
Meanwhile, the regulatory income in Opole (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average in the U.S. and 98% in Lubusk.
The highest incomes were in Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesian (104%).
On average in Poland, the regulated income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes), it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Against the background of previous years, the result is quite low.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While revenue growth slows down, it also slows down spending growth.
These per person amounted to PLN 1187, which means that they decreased by 0.7% in real terms.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditures per person increased by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Surveys of household budgets suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1 per cent of its regulated income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80 per cent and by 2006 it exceeded 90 per cent.

Unfortunately, the photojournalists captured the blatant error of Paulina Smaszcz-Kurzajewska.
The woman wore a white bra under a black shirt, which she wore tightly.
U.S.: Three suicides among aircrew crew
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush last week, the US Navy said in a statement.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members of this ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and the previous one in November of 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of the events occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush docked off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the participation of third parties in the case has been excluded.
Deaths are not related to each other.
“We need everyone to be involved in making suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent the next suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigma or other repercussions associated with seeking help,” said Sean Bailey, the ship’s captain.
Criticism of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In a conversation with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was an enormous authority for opposition activists.
“Actually, every sentence was accepted.”
Then came criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was not able to eliminate Rydzyk’s harmful activity is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this Redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media into the best in the life of the Polish pope,” he explained.
The former PO politician admitted: “There were rumors of discontent, the pope said something, once Rydzyka did not accept, but he had power and for politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or to Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do this, similarly to his successor," explained Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski.
“Besides, this fatal case of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, and indeed their absence, has occurred.
I ran a little forward, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.
We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church relatively recently.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," he says in a conversation with journalist Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski.
In the opinion of the former Polish politician PO, the Church is an ally of PiS.
“We must admit that during the period of Solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Mass, the crosses hung everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about this and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will come to pay the price,” Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski said.
“I hope that Pope Francis will pursue J<0xC4><0x99>draszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type,” he said.
Hrubiesz<0xC3><0xB3>w: Tomorrow celebrates the 590th anniversary of the county
There will be concerts and auctions.
The jubilee gala will take place at the Hrubieszowski House of Culture.
First at 10 am in the church of St. Nicholas will start the Mass of St. Nicholas.
The official opening of the ceremony will take place at 11.30 in HDK.
There will be a group of songs and dances of the Hrubieszowska Land.
Young people from the I LO named Stanis<0xC5><0x82>aw Staszica will present a performance entitled “Grubieszowski County: Hence my family – here I live”.
The medals "Deserved for the county of Hrubieszow" will then be awarded.
At 4 p.m., the event will be transferred to the City Hall, where the concerts “Hrubiesz<0xC3><0xB3>w charitably for Angelika Zi<0xC5><0x84>kiewicz” will take place.

PZPN throws penalties behind bars in stadiums.
Gryffindor disqualified
The fight in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk with little hair did not end tragically when the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovic, passed by the fans of the Wejherowo raccoon by millimetres.
After this incident, the game was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN commission investigating this case imposed a severe penalty on the Gryf, excluding him from future competitions.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed in the next match at their own stadium.
They will also not be able to leave in groups for league matches until December 31.
Burdy at the Widzewa <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA> stadium also attracted fans of Silesia Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Here, however, the sentence of the PZPN was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities in this matter.
Despite this, the services allowed to overturn the sector of <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA> fans with worms, to set fire to the chairs and to force the host sector.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to matches in this and the next edition of the PP.
The travel ban also included Ekstraklasa league matches, but it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange markings throughout the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w
In Podkarpatia, the implementation of the amendment of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among other things, the registration of the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish began.
For example, "Lions" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our voivodeship, the changes will be made on 94 road signs along the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it should be easier, more legible and simpler.
The new guidelines are the result of the amendment of the Minister of Infrastructure’s regulation on detailed technical conditions for road signs and traffic safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of the villages in the neighboring countries often also have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the change in law prepared by us, they will finally appear on the road signs near our roads.
The introduction of the new marking begins with the sub-Carpathian section of the A4 motorway," said Infrastructure Minister Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpatia, changes will be made to 94 road signs along the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total cost of investment?
200,000 zlotys.
First of all, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is scheduled for November 1, 2019.
What should the implementation of the idea look like?
It will be without replacing the boards, on the basis of adhesives.
They will replace the currently functioning names of the village with new ones, written in Polish on already existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line – first in Polish, and then in the original, in the middle.
This will be a great facility for people who do not know the spelling of foreign names of cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan in the windmill.
In the pond in Zameczne in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants noticed a swan having problems with its wings.
After fishing and visiting a veterinarian, it turned out that someone had set a target with the animal – a shot from a windmill was found in his body.
“Information about the injured bird was received from the villagers at the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Center in Nowa Sala.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately apparent that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to harm him or expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the veterinarian.
After the first photo of the RTG, it was already known that someone had made it a shooting shield.
There were fragments of shot in his body," says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, which manages the rehabilitation center.
It's cold in the center
"The wounds have been cleansed, the bird has been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the center, where he will spend all winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He is not able to fly yet.
The release of him now would be linked to the fact that he would most likely not survive the winter," Walasek adds.
The staff after undergoing rehabilitation of the swan intends to release it in the spring to the same pond.
The authorities of the municipality of <0xC5><0xBB>ukowice, after receiving information about the cause of the poor health of the animal, intend to inform the prosecutor's office about the case.
The event took place in Zameczne
Gowin: "We must stimulate Polish, small trade"
“Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Gowin, leader of the Agreement, said on Friday.
Gowin during a conversation in “Signals of the Day” on radio Jedynce stated that trade is dominated by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
Noting that this problem is very difficult to combat, the deputy prime minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of his term, but received "contrast from the EC".
“We have won before the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates the government, we will come back to this issue,” he said.
At the same time, he stressed that “effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore small trade”.
“Moreover, it will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, the EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in considering the Polish retail tax as an unauthorised state aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act envisages the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% on income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to be effective from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated proceedings for breach of EU law by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be considered as public aid.
It then claimed that the fine had been put into effect in a way that was unlawful.
It also issued an order suspending the application of the tax until its analysis by officials in Brussels is completed.
Poland did not agree to this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court paved the way for the reimposition of the tax, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSUE press services reported to the PAP that the case is currently at a written stage where both the European Commission and the Polish government are presenting their arguments in writing.
At the moment, it is not known if and when the oral procedure, i.e. the hearing of the parties and the possible hearing, is under way.
It takes a good few to a few months from the appeal to the announcement of the verdict.
“Such a procedure takes an average of a year,” a PAP source told the Court in Luxembourg.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer a few practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.
It is often the first time that the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating together his appearance in the world.
No wonder, then, that the freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look the best on this day.
However, before you make the final decision about the baby’s outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In stores, you can find many outfits that do not provide the baby with proper comfort.
So what should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, several weeks old babies were baptised, arranged in white sets and placed in the same caskets or large pillows.
Today, children who join the sacrament are often older: several months old, annual, or even larger.
It is not difficult to guess that such a great comfort already needs a little different clothes for baptism .
Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, the celebration will probably be spent in a wheelchair or in the hands of parents or godparents.
Therefore, the best way out will be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton dorms or sets.
Although this element of the wardrobe is considered a daily outfit, it is enough to look for its solemn variants, for example, with a folding or lace.
For the boy, the perfect body with a fly and scarf print will turn out to be.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have more fantasy in your clothes.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tulle dress
Many parents of girls look forward to richly decorated, wavy christening dresses complete with coats, belts and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, breathable materials for their product, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right clothes, it is better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant dresses on cotton linings.
Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, appliqués and cute kits will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a small gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, among the parents of boys, there was a fashion for suits that are a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or hats often made the young elegants demonstrate their dissatisfaction loudly.
Today, fortunately, they have been replaced by comfortable, cotton sets.
Just take a look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, that is, soft, sweater pants, and for this blouse decorated in front to the pattern of the vest.
These outfits look extremely solemn, and at the same time do not bother the movements of getting to know the world of the toddler.
Krystyna Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz published a property statement
Krystyna Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz submitted a statement of assets at the end of her term of office.
It follows that the member of the PiS collected 110 thousand zloty of savings.
Let us recall that Pawlowicz announced his departure from politics.
At the end of his term, he has an amount of 110 thousand zlotys.
According to the statement made by the member, she collects a monthly pension worth PLN 4.7 thousand.
Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz has an apartment worth PLN 570,000 and a little smaller, which he rents, charging PLN 880 per month.
The member also invests in industrial metals, estimating the investment at 150 thousand PLN.
Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski also published the property statement earlier.
Voting on the pause in the negotiations during the Conservative Party conference
British lawmakers voted against a three-day hiatus in the House of Commons during the Conservative Party’s annual programme conference, the government has called for.
There were 289 MEPs in favour and 306 against.
Usually, the House of Commons does not convene during party conferences, so that deputies do not have to resign either from attending them or from parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties felt that at a crucial time as the last few weeks before Britain’s planned exit from the European Union on 31 October, parliament should not interrupt the talks.
There were 289 MPs in favour of the government's request for a break, against 306.
There are two opposition parties after the conventions.
The lack of consent for a break can be seen as a political revenge on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was deemed by the Supreme Court to be incompatible and inconvenient) and for the fact that after the judge's verdict, he does not want to do so.
After this decision, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson’s speech and the turbulent debate that followed.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“It’s time to implement Brexit.
It has to be implemented to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with an agreement on citizens’ priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
“Brexit needs to be done so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is set to begin in Manchester on Sunday and will run until Wednesday, October 2.
The conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the justifications that Johnson gave in explaining the lengthy suspension of parliament was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” foreign media write.
The President's spokesman has strongly denied these reports.
“It’s just not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>a Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing Jewish Insider, write that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York, stated that Israel was to blame for the latest anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, who said in February that “the Poles sucked anti-Semitism with their mother’s milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regrets that Israel has not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an assailant who shouted: "Polish, Polish".
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
This is simply not true,” Bla<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda “never said that Israel is responsible for the latest anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.”
According to Spychalski, the portal “invented it”.
According to interlocutors "JI" during the meeting there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, awarded with the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg had agreed with President Duda’s words and said that it was Jews from Israel “such as Israel Kac” who were responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to Boteach, Mosberg's speech was to be interrupted.
Who is Bana<0xC5><0x9B> and what did he do?
The house, rented by the souterrains, led the journalist to discover the negligence in the property statements of Marian Banasi.
We are summarizing another affair that shocked the ruling camp.
Journalists of “Supervisor” TVN revealed that Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B>, the president of the Supreme Audit Chamber, in recent years has not entered in the declaration of the property of the 400-metre building, which is located on the Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w Podg<0xC3><0xB3>rze.
What’s more, his tenant was supposed to run a sex business in the aforementioned tenement (and therefore rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself was supposedly a collateral for the repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the program "Supervisor".
The reporter revealed that people linked to the criminal world had rented the building from Banasi to use it as a place for “erotic meetings”.
Clients were supposed to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> replied vaguely and vaguely to the allegations.
Interestingly, the tenant-rented building led the journalist to discover neglect in the property statements of Banasia.
The building itself was vaguely described in them, and the income from its rental was supposed to be underestimated.
“The estate of Marian Banasi and his wife may be worth between PLN 6 and 8 million.
In total, spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the town of Banasia itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office is currently auditing Marian Banasi’s financial statements for the years 2015–2019.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> announced that by the time it is completed, he will suspend his activities at NIK. “I will go to your marshal for free leave,” he assured.
The opposition is demanding an explanation.
“We do not hear the CBA expand its investigation or expedite the investigation of Marian Banasi’s financial statements.
Therefore, we are forced to extradite the state authorities and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...]", - said Mariusz Witczak, a member of PO-KO.
“If a normal Pole had so low a price for renting his property, he would already have 10 checks, a tax dominance and a criminal-tax procedure,” he added.
He fell high, he fell low
Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is the new President of the Supreme Audit Chamber.
He was appointed to this position on August 30, 2019, for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was declared by the Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party were accepted.
Previously, Bana<0xC5><0x9B> was associated with NIK in the years 1992-2005., he worked in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski.
During the first governments of PiS (2005-2008), Bana<0xC5><0x9B> held the position of President of the Customs Service and also undersecretary of state in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has again sat on the chair of the head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has been managing the National Treasury Administration.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> served for 3 months as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.
Cooler Master Launches Graphics Card Holder

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the policeman's order will be punished
According to the newspaper, negligence of a policeman’s order for certain behavior is to be a new type of offence, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.
The police unions want to make such a change.
The idea was sent to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million infringement cases are brought to the Polish courts,” we read.
"Rzeczpospolita" has determined that the petition, which the Independent Union of Policemen is writing to the deputies on the amendment of the code of offences has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It should read: “Whoever does not submit to the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the law, shall be subject to imprisonment, fine or restriction of liberty.”
“Paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of an identical punishment for those who, without carrying out orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of an official activity,” the newspaper reports.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in political demonstrations.
“In situations of libertarian demonstrations, it would be unfavorable and, instead of easing the situation, it would even be aggravated,” he added.
According to statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that each month the service takes 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
J<0xC3><0xA1>chym Topol's writing is in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important Czech playwrights of the post-war period, now listed in a row with V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel.
From the very beginning, therefore, there was a curse on J<0xC3><0xA1>chym for the talent he was trying to use.
After eight years, he returned with a "Sensitive Man."
The heroes are Buras and So<0xC5><0x88>a along with their two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They are travelling actors, they travel around Europe.
He’s a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she’s a one-eyed translator who doesn’t break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound, and for the second time stopped in the infancy.
But it's not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
They are all just a backdrop for observing a world in which there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It's a world of congested provinces, a society of old, suspicious people, and dissolute young people.
The "sensitive man" in places turns into an absurd theatrical.
The narrative mimics didascalia, and the conversations of the heroes create this world.
The scene is a Europe full of worries about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.
However, the company has problems.
Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All office trips that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Ghent also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.
As early as Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company is now “fully operational” despite a bankruptcy announcement by a British parent company that has caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then reassured that customers who bought trips in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – declared bankruptcy on Sunday night.
The direct cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse on Sunday of the last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors demanded that in addition to the <0xC2><0xA3>900 million rescue plan already agreed in August, the company earn an additional <0xC2><0xA3>200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies typically have lower turnovers.
However, the company’s problems have increased for several years, resulting in a debt of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.

“I don’t think Slovenia has played fantastically.
We played very poorly.
This tournament is not over for us yet,” said the captain of the Polish national team, Micha<0xC5><0x82> Kubiak, after the defeat of Slovenia 1:3 in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for a review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the German arrivals Görlitz.
The actions are intended to help combat the progressive decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
Görlitz is the most easterly city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
As the Guardian writes, however, the city is struggling with significant problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, resulting in a 25% decline in the city’s population.
In 2013, it numbered 54,000 people.
To combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted for the programme.
Two-thirds of them were made up by the inhabitants of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the program.
“When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project participants.
“Now we feel it doesn’t matter if we stay here in four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has 7,000 vacancies, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move on permanently, the main objective of the program is to obtain the opinions of the participants of the program.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what their motivation was,” said program manager Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first of these was Detroit, which introduced a payroll program for promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa in Oklahoma.
