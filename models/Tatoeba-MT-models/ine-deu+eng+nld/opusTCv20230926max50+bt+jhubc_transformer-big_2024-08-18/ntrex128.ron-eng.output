Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they might give the impression that they are "marionettes"
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed because they have been suggested to change their title, i.e. to be called MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly within the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party within the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he is "reeling with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A Welsh National Assembly Party member said that, overall, the group “is not delighted” and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said the group had an "open" attitude to the name change, but also noted that "MWP" resembles "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as is the letter "u" in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly's committee, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the "Parliament of Wales".
With regard to the membership of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred “Wales Members of Parliament” or “WMP”, but the “MWP” option received the most votes in the public consultation.
It appears that members of the Welsh National Assembly have suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could give head to Elin Jones, the chairman of the steering committee, who is expected to send the draft amendment bill in a matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will have the final say in their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion regarding the change of the name of their country to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organized to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, the neighboring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not consider this vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is just a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin’s Episcopal Church have ceased bells as a result of problems facing the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before, you found a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“There are no bars or churches anymore.”
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he said.
“Bars no longer have the role of living room for the entire neighborhood, where people usually gather.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than leaders expect and that, “sooner or later, the outcome will be the same.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who will not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “thus, this will speed up the closure of churches because it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist congregation, made up of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
An African-American congregation, which carried out its religious activities nearby, took over the building.
The church was taken over by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting African-Americans.
A fire that took place in 1939 greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in them.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to the church of St. Martin, called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who commissioned the carillon in July described it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical tool".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also said it was the world’s first carillon performed by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by the episcopal diocese.
Sacristy, the diocese's governing entity, consisting of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the sacristy, even if it was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained about the lack of transparency that the diocese has shown.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy trying to catch lobsters in California
According to authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming for about half an hour, along with his friends, on Saturday morning, when he heard a boy screaming for help and then moved along with a group that helped him get out.
Hammel said he initially thought the boy was thrilled to have caught a lobster, but then realized he was shouting “He bit me!
He bit me!"
The entire collarbone was torn, Hammel said, when he reached the boy.
“I called out to everyone in the water and told them to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a shark species that poses a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma in the upper part of the trunk.
Authorities have restricted access from Ponto beach from Casablad to Swami from Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons.
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s retailer plans to strengthen its position in the UK’s beauty and fashion products market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing neighborhoods with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn (<0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn) strengthening of the UK beauty products market, which continues to grow, although sales of household and fashion products are not on track, larger areas with beauty products will be tested in more than 11 stores in the country.
The investment in the beauty industry comes in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the space previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Representatives of retailer Sainsbury said the number of beauty products it offers will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas similar to those in Boots stores.
Also, the supermarket is relaunching its makeup range, Boutique, which means that most of the products are intended for vegan people, an increasingly common demand among young shoppers.
In addition, French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury’s chain for testing purposes, the first being the one opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second half of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of retailer Sainsbury’s, said outlets will increasingly look like universal stores as supermarket chains try to cope with the fight with the big discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has included both products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores, and Habitats, since it purchased both chains two years ago, meaning it has seen food sales rise as well as profit increases.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty products compartments has failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ended after a divergence over how to split the Boots store's revenues into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business, which included 281 stores, to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
This means Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s Retailer, said: “We’ve transformed the look of our districts with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to provide you with advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an extraordinary location to buy beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Is Angry After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Contract
Dragons’ Den TV star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle deal with his company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of “This Morning” announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby sparked the fury of Peter Jones, the protagonist of the show “Dragons’ Den”, retiring at the last minute from their business offering lifestyle services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was outraged when one of the most beloved people on television admitted on Tuesday, during a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, no longer allow her to dedicate her trademarks.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby’s fortune, with an estimated value of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would quit his contract for Truly, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to retire shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was a little bit before the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at the Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the presenter of the show “This Morning”, which is among the best-selling stars in the UK, could harm the company by millions, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible further delay of the launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as director in March.
The couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very hard, and then "we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and about the fact that he has such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
He said Trump was imitating a voice as a “news presenter.”
“I didn’t take a step back.”
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have ended.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not noticed a "appropriate response" from the United States on previous North Korean moves.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
“Everything is going well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were heading for a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He also said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: the cessation of missile tests, support for the release of the hostages and the return of the U.S. military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to behave like a president, but if I behaved like that, instead of the 10,000 people out there trying to get into this non-competing arena, there would be around 200 people,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia have devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, a necessary condition for triggering relief actions at the international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known if foreign staff are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to relief efforts.
Given the earthquakes sustained by Indonesia constantly, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be insufficiently prepared for the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not very often found on other coasts.
It appears that the lack of a warning siren in the case of the Palu tsunami, although a warning has been issued in this regard, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under the best of circumstances, travelling between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this even more.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the spot where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo has proposed improving Indonesia’s poor infrastructure to be the focal point of his election campaign and has generously allocated money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko’s administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from Indonesian sects as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the saving goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge football stadium.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 meters from the opponent's goal, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a shot in the direction of the goal.
The ball reached over the cart, heading towards the upper right corner of the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and fell into the goal.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as far ahead as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn’t think much about it, I just took the ball on.”
Chelsea led 1-0 to the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then turned in the middle of the field and ran to the half of the Liverpool team's field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who went into the cage.
Hazard overtook the defense and sent the ball into the net, managing to hit it with his left foot and pass Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will have a match against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami reached 832, according to the national disaster agency on Sunday morning.
More people have been trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and triggered waves of up to 6 meters, the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000 people, has been covered by debris caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murdering Woman
An investigation into the murder was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stabbing wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything related to this subject to come to the statement section.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to all the people who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful material with the help of the on-board camera to contact us if they have any information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a woman in Birkenhead and was found on a property.
This afternoon, several people came to the scene of the crime who think they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
The people living in the building were told it would take a few more hours for them to be allowed in.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered the scene of the crime.
On the spot, a woman in tears appeared.
He kept saying, “It’s so horrible!”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the perimeter and another was outside.
Several police officers were standing in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to the <0x40>MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention the September 30 case 247.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the latest memorial affected by altercations over "rewriting history"
Its removal would represent a poetic justification for the Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its fanatical Puritan descendants.
But the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "insanity" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of the statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure from outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas of the previous century.
Cromwell’s magnificent representation, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe deserve to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course, the monarchy.
Whether or not it is an exact representation, this is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
But surely the conflict of the mid-17th century led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure who represents part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
A pig killed a farmer in China.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by the family name "Yuan", was found dead after an artery was cut and covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui Square in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday edition of the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject swine vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He appeared to have come with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a neighboring cot was open.
He said that in the cot there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic doctors confirmed that a pig weighing about 300 kg caused the death of the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s feet were full of blood and nipples,” the cousin, whose family name is Wu, told the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the death of the man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police collected evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, cases of pigs that have attacked humans have also been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300-pound pig, a Welsh man was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and chase the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions.
“They are simply playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwestern United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa loses intensity as it moves toward colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday at 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depressive zone has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastwards to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push intense tropical humidity from the north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation of up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressive zone will generate abundant rain in the southwest in the following days.
Local rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation is expected between 5 and 10 cm in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to conditions of rapid deterioration due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rains could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into gusts and dust.
The approaching depressive zone will bring torrential rains to areas on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of almost 2 cm is possible, which could cause minor flows of residues and slippery roads.
These will be the first rains in the region in the wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of Sunday and the first part of Monday, before the rains spread further Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the so-called “four corners” on Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature changes in the U.S. as the Arctic region becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes, this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, there are dramatic temperature differences in the U.S. central area.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to face a warm start to October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees Celsius in extended areas, from the southern plains to certain portions of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high chances of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched the press release backed by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that is believed to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, with TV stations interrupting Friday’s normal program for a breaking news story: an agreement concluded between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an indictment investigation for a week.
Ford told the court that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was harassing her while he was intoxicated and that he tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said that it is 100% certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted the average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that of a playoff football game or Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was ahead of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daily audition.
ABC was in second place, with a viewership of 3.26 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was at the heart of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that it would vote in Kavanaugh’s favor, he was filmed on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him and he tried to climb into an elevator at a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stared down for a few minutes as people argued with him, and everything was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling us the truth?
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Television later broadcast the vote live in the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to review the charges against the nominee next week, as demanded by minority democracies.
Flake was largely convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators afterward.
Flake's election was an important one, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of 'political games' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview for the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside his front-page photo, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on its Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union collect their reciprocal tariffs was “rich.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Wayde Sims, the 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on charges of Grade 2 murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have posted footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say that he admitted that he shot Wayde deadly.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Bureau of Forensic Medicine released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the death was caused by a shot in the head through the neck.
The department pays tribute to the Louisiana police force, the state police's forensic laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for the assistance offered in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked police for “diligence and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98m tall attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This worries me all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano has thrown a column of ash over Mexico City.
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after activity in the crater triggered and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors several howls and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity of the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s secession vote, gathering thousands of opposing demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away from gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded with tourists.
The robbery intensified later, with police using their batons to control the situation.
For hours, pro-independence groups chanted “Don’t forget, don’t forgive,” while Unionist protesters shouted “Long live Spain!”
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent a year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose, in an overwhelming majority, to become independent, although participation in the vote was low, and those against the secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, with violent clashes taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday evening to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for independence from Catalonia.
“Last year I had some of the best moments of my life.
I watched my parents cry with joy that I could vote, but now we have nothing left to do,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital but close victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan pro-independent parties have tried to maintain the momentum this year, many of the most well-known leaders are either in their own exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in the organization.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison since late last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: More Men Arrested After Driving Into A House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly entered a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and even the building.
It seems that at one point a crossbow was used against the car.
Menga's shot helped Livingston win 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left Rangers without a match, with Steven Gerrard reaching his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team remains without a moving Premier League win this season and faces the Hearts leaders, being behind them with eight points next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the division for up to six games, with Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat as he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against cruel visitors
Holt's team should have advanced long before enrolling, and their orientation caused all sorts of trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and tried to kick into the gate space, then Alan Lithgow managed to kick wide after slipping in to intercept the ball sent with the head of Craig Halkett.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause visitors trouble at the free kicks.
And that was how the crucial gap came in.
The Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston managed an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to care for Menga, who shot and scored from the centre of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers dominated the possession, but faced the host's impenetrable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was no longer largely disturbed in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow took a big hit from another player on the Livingston team.
The diagonal passes continued to come in that of the Livingston team, but unsuccessfully, and the two penalty requests - after Halkett snatched Glenn Middleton and after a hurdle - were not accepted.
"Phenomenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and team haven't changed much since returning to the top, but the merits must be given to Holt for the way he's coached his team since taking over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the game.
But the Rangers were not very inspired.
Although they have had good performances since being driven by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The goal passes were unsuccessful, they only managed once to catch the goal of the opponents free, and this should be an alarm for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the leaderboard.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
It was all pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at redressing relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied with issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside Turkey.
Police invoked security reasons to prevent the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but gathered enough supporters nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, most of them Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him with open arms into the country.
The conflicting protests reflect the division over a visitor considered a hero by some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after collision with a car
A cyclist has died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes just months after another cyclist died in an accident on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the scene, which is about a mile from where the Saturday accident occurred.
Metropolitan police said the officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in the area, the bus route is diverted, and motorcyclists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six Officers Injured in Fight
Six officers from the prison were injured in a fight at a high-security men's prison, a prison official said.
On Sunday, a fight broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9:30, which was in progress.
Specialized officers were brought in to deal with the fighting, in which eight detainees are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “Specialised prison staff have been requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period behind bars."
In the HMP Long Lartin are more than 500 detainees, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a detainee.
And last year, in October, rioting officers were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, with staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are at risk of being flooded due to Hurricane Rosa (dry areas can enjoy benefits as a result)
A tropical depression rarely happens in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwestern desert, posing a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of Monday it will cause precipitation.
The Phoenix National Weather Service announced in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression at a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action at a distance of about 60 km from the border with Arizona.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation ranging from 5 to 10 cm, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including in the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities ranging from 3 to 5 cm will be recorded, with total quantities possible up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas, torrential rain will be beneficial, as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona faces at least severe drought, the second-largest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on Mexico’s Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power on Sunday morning, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 19 km per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, posing a high risk of flooding.
“We expect torrential rains ranging between 8 and 10 cm” from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can reach up to 25 cm,” according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona on Tuesday morning, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and arriving in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger people’s lives, and will bring waste streams into the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stabbing wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-olds were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The officers asked for the help of citizens who could have materials on their mobile phones, respectively, to present themselves to the police station.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Faced “Discontent and Anger” of Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh faced the Democratic Party's "discontent and anger" during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford’s claims that she sexually harassed her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her assertion.
The president said Saturday that “the American people saw on that day the genius, the quality and the courage” of Kavanaugh.
“A vote of confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation for one of the best minds in the legal field of this generation,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not running, but in a way, I’m running,” he said.
“For this reason, I am expressing my positive opinion about the candidates I consider to be extraordinary.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by late Friday, an assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds Killed by Indonesian Earthquake as Number Rises
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves hitting beaches when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in Palu town on Friday, when waves six meters high hit the beach at dusk, people being taken by the waters and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still seeing their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, thus becoming victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a press conference.
"The tsunami brought with it cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled offshore at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to climb trees to get rid of the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs published by the disaster agency show several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges toppled and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the replicas continued to shake the city on the coast.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy emitted by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb of World War II.
The geographical structure of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow gulf, probably intensified the magnitude of the tsunami, the representative added.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found caught under the wreckage of the collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 people injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely disrupted, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was harshly criticized for not informing that a tsunami would hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In posts on social media, one can hear a man on the upper floor of a building shouting frenzied warnings that the tsunami is approaching the people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by authorities.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still need food and other basics.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned a visit to the Palu evacuation centers for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff at Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in makeshift shelters in the office courtyard, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Even though relief groups have begun to initiate relief actions in the event of a disaster, some people have complained that foreign workers with extensive expertise have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, material delivery and personnel can only reach the site of a disaster if it is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s another disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
“After the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet.”
After the second night of the earthquake and tsunami Friday in Palu, the friends and families of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously rescued from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescue personnel released a woman who had been under the ruins for two days, with her mother’s body next to it.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, coached for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding drivers.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Given my experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to competitors in Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in the right of his messages appeared only a gray beak, and not two blue beaks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t sent,” he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “runned behind the employee Brink” and stole a bag of money to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses observed several suspects who fled from the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changed his stage name to "Ye".
He made the announcement on Twitter on Saturday: “the person officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled "for reasons of an emotional nature," the show's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West has previously stated that this word also has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m new, it’s about us.
It all started with "Kanye", which means the only one, and ended with "Ye", which is a reflection on our good, bad, unclear things and the whole.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are as individuals.”
He is one of several rappers who have chosen to change their stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
And a former West collaborator, Jay-Z, changed his name, sometimes with credentials, sometimes without, as well as in uppercase letters.
Mexico's president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military forces against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
The troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when student leftist movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying and by opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for AI
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lacks an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be at the forefront of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next AI discovery,” Lee said.
Doubling funds could double the chances of the next big AI achievement being made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the American player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later served as executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated previous technology competitions of U.S. governments, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, to help identify future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s putting sticks in the way of academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. step up its AI efforts.
“I think we should automatically offer visas to PhD students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to individuals in academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of an Artificial Intelligence Selection Commission.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called AI Next.
Also, at this time, NSF is investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, there have been no changes to U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday if they wanted the country's name changed to "Republic of North Macedonia," a change that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, claims the name of the neighboring country represents a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign has raised doubts about the voter turnout, and it is possible that the minimum 50% limit required to validate the referendum will not be reached.
The question on the ballot in the referendum will be: “Do you agree to join the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?”.
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to pay by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum in parliament is required.
The state electoral commission said that no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66% of people with voting rights voted.
“I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje, the country’s capital.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted for the referendum on changing the name of Macedonia, which will allow him to join NATO and join the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov has prepared a small-scale scene and pulled seats in front of the tents raised by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads up, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted in the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the majority will be in favour of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU,” Zaev said after voting.
He said a result in favor of changing the name would be “confirming our future.”
According to a poll published last month by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, below the required number of participants.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote for change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since the government took over in May last year.
Video: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero manages to pass the entire Brighton team's defense and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass the Brighton team's defense and won the Manchester City team's 2-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among three defensive players from Brighton, before reaching the free side of the field.
Then, Aguero woke up surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to pass a defender, and then overcame several adversarial players on the sidelines of the Brighton team.
After that, he took a pass to the left, the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English striker sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, managing to avoid Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right of the goal.
"Aguero is facing a few foot problems," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling is the one who got their initial lead for the Blues in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep pass on the territory of the Brighton team at that stage.
Then he gave a pass on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane dribbled the ball several times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it in the direction of the gate.
The Blues striker hit the ball into the net just before heading out of the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc in the game against the Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the playoffs, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win the game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still implications in the playoffs for the Rockies, who hold an advantage with a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least one unpredictable place, with a 5-2 win over the national team on Friday night, but are still trying to keep their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level at any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these circumstances?”
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but according to sources, it is inclined to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening shot of the game with the number 34, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has an 18-7 score and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 misses in 220 and 2/3 games this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding the Supreme Court’s decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“All of our efforts are at stake in November.
There are still five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big ones, I’m not running, but I’m actually running, so I’m trying my best to support the good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “See this horrible, radical group of democrats, see what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by using any necessary means, you can see their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that’s what they want, to have power and control, and we won’t give it away.”
He also said that the democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
"And you can see that in the last four days," he said, describing Democrats as "angry and evil, naughty and liars."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is part of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was heavily evaded by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you divulge the document?
Uh, please?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute -- that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people from a different point of view.
People who express their opinions are no longer tolerated.
I was not surprised at all that the Momentum activists in my local party supported the censorship motion for me.
After all, I am only one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, has been treated similarly because she has been vehemently anti-Semitic.
As far as I am concerned, the motion of censorship was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, about which neither Jeremy had common opinions with previous leaders.
The communiqué for Friday’s meeting in Nottingham East of the Labour Party mentioned that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For much of the eight-year term as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evening were thus.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a “better, gentler” political environment has long been forgotten, if ever respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things started to be like this when Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision on politics began to expect me to change my mindset and agree with some things I would not have agreed to before, including national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuses on the desocialization networks that demand my removal from the party, denouncing the center politics, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person who's facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censorship or change of selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible on this aspect.
Many people have advised me over the past two years to put my head down, not to be so vocal, and everything will be “okay” like this.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence of the Thatcher government led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those most in need, as a local councillor or minister.
I have never hid my political opinions, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and the issues with which I disagree with the current leadership are unclear.
To the people who supported Friday’s motion, I can only say that in the context of the country’s heading towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum Group in Nottingham, but for the citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of removal from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions that I consider your superior interest in.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the Ayr football team reaches the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late attempts somehow influenced the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today’s highly interactive match in Tennent’s Premiership.
He is now at the top of the rankings, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
In the end, it all boiled down to their better defense, as well as the fact that they took more of the chances, which helped the host team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
“We’ve been through several tests in our matches so far and we continue to be invincible, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “The merits are given to the Ayr team, they took advantage of the chances more than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, he played at the Warriors, allowed Melrose to try to change the score to a different one.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the match, managed to score, and then managed to transform an individual try, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was removed from the field with the bar, and since the resumption of the game, Ayr has unleashed through the tryout of player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr team captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the back-up player pay with an untransformed try of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a terrible pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for plating Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving him the edge of the Ayr team.
Climo transformed the tryout, as he did again close to the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe performed a "box kick" move and sent the extreme Gregor Henry into the depths for the host team's fifth tryout.
“Still Game” sitcom star looks set for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the sitcom Still Game, seems set to move into the hospitality industry after learning he has been named the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the beloved BBC show, writing its script and playing alongside his longtime partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, the number nine, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, though a source from the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “restaurants’ developing industry.”
'The sea is ours': Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific
The sailors patrol a crane-filled naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings bear the blue-coloured flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is ours by law.
We've got to get her back."
Along Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive – just like the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will give a ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is bound to negotiate a sovereign exit from the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial fight for next year’s re-election – also has much to gain from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that too little would change if it happened.
The Dutch UN body does not have the power to grant Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision comes just six months after the final pleas were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only did Bolivia not succeed in the cause, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric weakened any remaining Chilean benevolence, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end the 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most beloved presidents – was using the maritime issue as a political backing.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go beyond the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if the United States can’t be trusted
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour its promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic action on the nuclear threat more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "unreal dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration regarding the end of the Korean War would ever make northern territory cede.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the statement without the Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that Pyongyang has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris showcases the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for hats to expand your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you no longer need to look.
Fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at Paris Fashion Week by launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
Not-so-practical hats have conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion makers have sent creations that steal their eyes onto the podium.
The piece of strength of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant hat, beige, with a wide pin, like a feather, in which the ends of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with beads, a magician’s hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of Hannibal Lecter's chosen accessory, and not haute couture fashion.
One of the creations appeared to be a diving gear, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other appeared to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a clothing style, with oversized clothing items, you are in luck.
Stylists expect a return of huge hats in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats come back after the appearance of the “La Bomba” hat, the wide-brimmed straw hat, seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the not practical hat that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely straw bags for the beach, with a size as large as the model in the swimsuit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the sturdy piece of Jacquemus’s spring-summer 2019 “La Riviera” collection at Paris Fashion Week
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer because the fashion designer has had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Competencies, Essential for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record for academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a particular school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest rates of promotion within independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as subjects, are held in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for reasons employers gave for the struggle for vacancies, 17% were attributed to a language skills deficit.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%.
That’s why investing in foreign language learning is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing economies, children will have a greater chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be more languages of choice within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done (it has to be done).

LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is nearing the end for fans who want to see LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play at the opening of Sunday's preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play remains to be settled.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need preseason games to prepare,” he said.
Time of Trump’s election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops in places where voters favor him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his nominee for the vacancy at the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for future midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s election rally in West Virginia take place tonight and where can I follow him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. East Coast time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election rally in West Virginia online via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a hearing that has become tense due to allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate’s expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week for the FBI to investigate the charges.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who are facing tough elections in November, gain some ground.
Trump’s campaigners said the role of these five rallies next week is “energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very busy campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally this evening could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won the election by a more than 40 percent difference in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is being led in polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to push him into polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team demonstrates determination and continues to fight to maintain the chance for simple trials starting on Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it’s possible that Saturday afternoon’s foursome rehearsal was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever-oscillating pendulum of motivation is an invented concept for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So, where is their motivation now?
“They drove us with six points, now the difference is only four points, so we rely on this drop for a bit of motivation,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are still twelve points left in the game.
Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons to encourage, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won each three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green area with lethal precision, setting an example for his colleagues.
Those festive cheers became more and more noisy as the round progressed, especially when he scored a crucial point that brought the score back to par in the fourth game, after he and Thomas had been led by two points after the first two holes.
The shot that won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar shout, a shout that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth says.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe has won four out of four matches and it seems they can’t fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't need any additional shots on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, and even for the nine points on Friday morning.
This performance and the way in which their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the opinion that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would bring to a successful end a potential victory of the Europeans when the Nationals strike.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
Talks about the glory of Europeans remain premature, for the time being.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs rehearsal, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
An extra shot and two doubles at the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep they weren’t even close to getting out of it.
On Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The fourballs and foursome samples are fascinating and deserve to be closely followed due to the interactions between pairs, given and undated tips and how a strategy can be changed on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after finishing fourballs and foursomes Saturday with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the pair led the offensive with two victories against a hesitant Tiger Woods, raising their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, trying to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes in the morning fourballs test and won the series with a score of 3 to 1.
The U.S. faced a more serious resistance to the foursome, where it won two games, but was unable to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points out of 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly supported themselves to defeat the discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two Saturday games, had occasional glimpses of genius, but so far has lost 19 of the 29 fourball and foursome games, seven of which were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome rehearsal and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, 1st and 3rd in the world, 2-1.
Europe, however, did not have an unobstructed route on this pleasant and cool day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They were able to win a 2–1 match against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in the singles, although, because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being in second place for two days in a row, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is “no chance” of disarming unilaterally as long as there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extending sanctions would deepen distrust in the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the Global Council that "significant measures to prove their good faith" were implemented in North Korea last year, such as halting nuclear testing and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing site and the commitment to non-proliferation of weapons.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"If we can't trust the United States, we won't trust our national security capabilities, and under such circumstances, we can't unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri resumed familiar objections by North Korea to Washington’s counter-resistance to a “standardized” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject the unilateral past denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first-ever summit between a U.S. president and North Korea's leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," while Trump offered North Korea security assurances.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not heeded calls for a relaxation of the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The United States insists on the option of ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, and even objects to the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can kneel is an illusion that only people who don’t know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: "If the issue of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, this denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been successful."
Even under these conditions, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with missiles from North Korea was inevitable after "Mr. President Trump" called Kim a "missile-man" in his speech.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened North Korea with “total destruction” last year, praised Kim for the courage to begin the disarmament process, but said the work was just beginning and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned period for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have very good results.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but after only a few hours, North Korea denounced him as a "gangster threat."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch pad and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep longer, in an attempt to combat the growing “macho” culture that makes them submit to “all-night” high-caffeine-energetic learning sessions.
A scientist has discovered that often, students at the world’s most prestigious university do not even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to create the course after holding a lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on the ability to learn.
“In the end, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now, in the last year?’
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course may involve a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the image of a home room is presented, and students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
“We know we can’t immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud that they’ve learned all night long still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Adequate, good quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation makes the brain believe the body is hungry, making students feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before enrolling in this institution where the competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to schedule an alarm to know when it is time to go to bed, as well as for waking time, and to know what are the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when we wake up.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffer from another case of depression on the move because Dolly Menga's hit condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first away victory since their 4-1 win over St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach, putting the Rangers eight points behind the Hearts, the Labrokes Premiers.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and the uninspired Rangers players did not seem at any time able to equal.
The Rangers thus fell to sixth place in the standings, while Livingston climbed to third place, behind Hibernian, at a one-goal difference.
And the Rangers could face other problems as well, as cough referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the visitor team’s fans’ lawn.
Gerrard switched eight players from the lot that won slightly against Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained lot suffocated his opponents throughout the match.
Even though the Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first pass propelled Scott Pittman to the goal defended by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her by the bar.
The Rangers took control, but left the impression that they hoped more than trusted their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he clashed with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's demand.
The Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingstone’s 34th minute goal did not follow the game’s trend, no one can deny that it was worth it, even for the effort alone.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep centering of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga, who finished with a single shot.
Gerrard acted at the pause when he traded Ryan Kent for Coulibaly; this move almost immediately bore fruit when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly stepped out of the boot to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors in exactly the same type of match he preferred, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting centering after centering.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' shot, then Lithgow sent his header over the corner goal.
Glenn Middleton, a reserve at the Rangers, called for a penalty towards the end of the game, when he was hit by Jacobs but again, Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Almanac on Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the count CONTINUOUS...), is the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as happened in the film "The Bells of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the role of cowboys with unlikely inclinations toward science:
Man: “What’s that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “Yes, you can hear a lot of knocks!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.

As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can “detect” a protein common to many cancers and then are re-injected
A test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
Ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory in such a way that they can “detect” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “causes the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and “teach” them to target cancer cells, also worked to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a diatribe in support of Trump while wearing a Maga hat after appearing at the SNL.
It didn't work out too well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an outraged show in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he intends to run for office in the 2020 election.
After performing a third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist unleashed a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump?
Well, if I had been concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a scene featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's diatribe filming was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get over West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had backstage problems because of his hood.
“They tried to intimidate me behind the scenes.
They told me, “Don’t go out wearing this hat.”
I was assaulted!
They also told me that we have come very low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see how low I got?”, then said, “I’m going to grab Superman’s mantle, because that means you can’t tell me what to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments have attracted public outcry at least twice, and members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; one person from this team told the publication: "There was a complete silence in the studio."
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song I Love It dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits among us: THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE GLOBAL."
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply “himself and that’s great.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I think embraces and expresses an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that from now on he is "the being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in the footsteps of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Man charged with attempted murder for stabbing a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defence lawyer is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, star of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, The Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on screen makes the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she felt “something went wrong” and wondered how the issue of toxic masculinity could be handled in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-worker from the Thrones Puzzle, Rose Leslie, who is still 31, admitted that he is "very determined" to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m very determined to talk about it now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What have we taught men about how to be like adults, given the problem we are facing now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What do young boys learn from TV and on the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because it's clear that something bad has happened to the young people."
In the interview, he admitted that he will not play in any way the series based on the Urzel of Thrones after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying that "it's over with the battlefields and the horses."
In November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that has happened to him thanks to the series The Throne Jewel is that he met his wife, Rose.
“I knew my wife when I did this show, so it ensured my family’s future and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played Ygritte, the girlfriend of Jon Snow, the character Kit played in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to the next, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases come from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee disclosed the data of Republican senators, speaks of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the accusations were made by analysts and “extreme right” websites.
“Lies, lies and other miserable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The information disclosed included the personal addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court.
The leak came shortly after the three senators asked questions to Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and presented the information to a member of Waters' team, Hill reported.
“These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The team member, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie.”
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
He should not question the motive of the accuser.
It has to be calm and quiet.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters's reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticized by Democrats, who said he appeared a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in the mid-term elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
“It’s important, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted “the appropriate authorities and legal entities about these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be found out and that they will be held accountable to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any member of my team.”
Review Johnny English strikes again: spies film's flagless parody with Rowan Atkinson in lead role
It has become a tradition to look for meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the action film parody series that features Johnny English as the main character, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will this astonishing satire of how strange we are be able to become the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with his gaze and rubber face, was renewed for the second time his license to spoil everything. The name of the character means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the film audience in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the flamboyant secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of the kind that contributed a single note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious countryless man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind him.
This last adventure of JE also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the blades of the rotor hit his helmet lightly.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is rather weak and, oddly enough, superfluous, especially because “serious” movies, such as the 007 series or Mission Impossible, confidently offer comical moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to appeal more to children than to adults, and to me, Johnny English’s thrilling adventures aren’t as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson’s silent film gangs when playing the role of Bean.
As usual, the premise is always that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret web network of spies and revealed the identities of English undercover agents, to the dismay of the service agent, an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a pompous and under siege prime minister, who is already suffering a serious crisis due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can with her Theresa May-like character, but the script does not give him a chance to shine.
Her secret intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she must activate an agent in reserve.
This is the twelfth of Johnny English himself, now working as a teacher in a top-class school, which also gives lessons on how to be an undercover agent. Here are some nice guys, because English runs a school of spying in the style of the School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency session, then reunited with his then-partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a bit wasted.
So, these Batman and Robin of creating the entanglements in Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, confronting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls for a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of hilarious adventures: disguised as waiters, set fire to a fashionable French restaurant, create chaos as they sneak aboard Volta's luxury vessel, then English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual set of familiar spectacles for his spectacles.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colorful the film is, it looks like a television production for children.
A rather mediocre film.
As with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder: can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role to match his talent?
Labour denies plans for Britons to work four days a week but be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would have a radical plan that the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants company leaders to take advantage of the potential savings due to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees another day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have changed.
The sources say the idea would “match” the party’s economic program, which wants to tilt the balance in favor of workers.
The move to the four-day working week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “An announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a fitting aspiration in approaching the party’s rebalancing of the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the overall strategy of the party on industry.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party’s promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.”
The Lord Chancellor of the shadow cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “beneficiaries” from utility companies.
The plans of the Lord Chancellor of the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supply regions may not recover their shares in full, because the Labour government could receive “deductions” due to established crimes.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers to the company’s boards and create equity funds to cede 10% of the equity of private sector companies to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to about <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in 60 Minutes if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation would make him change his mind
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators could be persuaded not to back him because of the FBI’s findings.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I have said this since the beginning of the hearings; I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, “Are you guilty?”
The answer was decided, promptly, unequivocally."
Graham’s vote, however, seems to be dug into the stone.
“I’m determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so I would need some explosive accusations,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly rejects the allegations,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she named confirmed the story.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt it will change anything.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it succeeded in doing something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event attended by an impressive group of stars with an equally impressive mission: eliminating global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people to the Central Park meadow, not only to pursue artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to pay for a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help the global elimination of cones increase.
But what success did the Global Citizen Festival have when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism”, a concept that refers to people who feel they have accomplished something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011 there have been more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who have promoted different goals.
The organization says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, on which at least $10 billion has already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries who have pledged to “help children grow to their full potential,” which has pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 47 million tweets.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the history book,” Tracey April Ullman, The Power of Nutrition ambassador, told the crowd during a live concert.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it will fund The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road, sometimes we’ll fall and we’ll fail.
But like the great civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces for a "blockade" that would make Russia's energy exports more difficult, Interior Minister says
Washington can, “if necessary,” turn to naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argues that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason I’m in the Middle East is that I want to broker the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
“The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade so that energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, saying Russia “knows only one trick” because of the fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said the U.S. fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we look at things the same way: energy cannot be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Alexander Novak, Russia’s energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Secretary of Energy in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with a third country interfering in our energy issues,” Dieter Kempf, the president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is ‘seriously thinking’ of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday she needed to “seriously think” about running for president in the aftermath of the midterm elections.
During a meeting at Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that’s what a strong woman is needed for,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to run in the presidential election.”
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying that he “directed the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate he nominated for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “normally we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that even the majority of Warren’s voters don’t think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support his potential candidacy and 48% are against it.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said it would be officially decided by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder that Track Palin suffers from at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case.
“The things my own son is going through, what he went through after he came back... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” Trump said at a rally.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "are coming back a little different, tougher, they're coming back wondering if there's still respect for what they and their soldiers in the military and air force, as well as all the other members of the Army have done."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing reporting an act of domestic violence and holding a gun in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia contest new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims trying to escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District completed an amicus curiae request Friday in Washington to support a policy challenge on asylum seekers, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions trial that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a gang," abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-appointed lawyer who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced large numbers of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing a widespread problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision of the Council on Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“Federal law states that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle,” the petition reads.
In addition, lawyers argue in the petition that policies that deny entry to immigrants affect the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “supply the necessary workforce.”
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape gang abuse and violence.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership in a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the death toll has doubled, in a race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who relieves her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is not enough.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded possessions, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, were overtaken by the situation.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to his spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous responses.
He has tears in his eyes when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
US ambassador accuses China of 'abusing' 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda materials.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 congressional election, an accusation China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters it was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercials in which they promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war, which involves waves of tariff increases for imports.
Tariffs imposed by China in retaliation at the start of the trade war were created to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, experts from China and the United States said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
“When it spreads propaganda by publishing an ad in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of freedom of expression and a free press so cherished in America,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese citizens have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Communist Party.”
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China has refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans back and protect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from multiple sexual abuse allegations, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and most Republicans who have publicly discussed it intend to continue voting.
"Such reactions will not be forgotten," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group, said in a statement.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Come November!" as they demonstrated in the Senate halls when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very high,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
“People say they were already very old and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they do not approve of the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed allegations of sexual abuse brought to the nominee at the Supreme Court, analysts suggested he could follow a backlash if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
“This has turned into a mess for Republicans,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, it’s also about how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an electoral support group for Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents believe strongly or believe that Ford’s testimony is likely to be true, while 35% said they believe strongly or that Kavanaugh’s testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh abused her in a drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party while students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to establish a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee’s open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is “global domination.”
“Now we have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data archives” or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, schedules, calendars, music libraries, or other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this “personal data consolidation”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute with the appropriate resources, processes and skills, in a way that makes Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely taken over all at once.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergy who won the Victory Cross in the First World War is celebrated
The only cleric of the Anglican Church who won a Victoria Cross medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Rev. Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had been awarded Britain’s highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "wonderfully symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very high fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he hurried to get to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery", paved the way for the soldiers, then attacked an artillery nest alone and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to equal, but which makes me feel humiliated.”
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see the Bellator 206, but they got cartoons featuring Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching Bellator 206, a multi-star event, just so you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all, because they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to the children’s cartoon as “a kind of bad joke.”
“Government regulations say this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, they will schedule their events in such a way that they can also be watched by spectators in the UK.
“When I think about replays, I think we could probably solve it,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won’t be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started to receive a lot of text messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen again next time.
We’re going to go back to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We’ve tried to give fans more and we’ve exceeded the limit.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ to Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he only realized when he got to school that “not everyone is like me.”
Invited to Lauren Laverne’s first Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, he said he was talking about gay people’s rights to give others “hope.”
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the traditional show, will be missing a few months due to a disease.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "lower" than others because "it was socially unacceptable for me to like boys and girls as well."
He said: “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, it was the real things that gave me the strength and endurance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove he was “someone,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic gold medalist became a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and took advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk because he felt lucky to be able to live free, with no consequences, and because he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" by the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never an issue.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age,” he said at the first Olympics when he was just 14 and his father died of cancer after three years, he said, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who’s been through the same good and bad times.”
The two became parents in June to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, Daley says, changed his “whole perspective.”
“If I had been asked last year, I wouldn’t have been interested in anything other than winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if they had received tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t say to him, ‘You won’t be able to be first, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that I dreamed of a lifetime of jumping in front of my country's spectators at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired him in his chosen music, Heather Small's Proud, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excites him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was transferred to the reserve bank on Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in the forty-seventh game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to return to a good form so that this is not an unfortunate opportunity.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on to the reserve bank by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursome rehearsals.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States team, the five-time major tournament winner split his day between being a cheerleader for teammates and practicing his shots, hoping to straighten out what he did wrong.
The 48-year-old has never had the straightest drives, even at the best time of his career, so it’s not the best choice for the narrow ground at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish wrong shots.
And if the field isn’t a big enough challenge, in Sunday’s ninth game, Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points at the start of the 12 simple matches, which must start in force at this stage.
Furyk said he was confident in his player's ability, but could not have said anything else.
“He fully understood the role he played today, he hit me on the shoulder, he hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened, and that's how I thought we should go about it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has not risen to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s smart, he likes to joke with the players, he’s a great guy in the team’s locker room,” he said.
“I think the young players have fun joking with him, it was fun to see them do that during the week.
His role is more important, it’s not just about the game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the considerable advance could disappear soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but barely managed to beat them by a minimum difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remember that we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win,” said Bjorn (pictured) after watching how the 2018 team, who won 5-6 on both the National and the Golf.
“So history shows me and my team that it’s not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at full speed.
Let's get out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not finished until the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We’ve always said we have to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we also know what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Excited by the way his players handled difficult terrain, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow is a completely different situation.
Tomorrow, individual performances are important, and this is different.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when things go well, but when you’re on your own, then you’re tested to the fullest, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, that they have to be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play better in the simple test than they did with partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such a comeback on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing team when Europe succeeded in "the miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word," he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfield matches.
We created the right lot and ordered the players the way we wanted, you know, we're trying to create a little bit of magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers all the subjects," Bjorn said of the batch for the simple test.
Germany's new warship postponed again
Germany’s newest naval frigate should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War warships, but this will only happen next year, due to flawed systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to be introduced to the maritime forces in 2014, but problems that arose after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is assumed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles, as well as stealth technologies, which ensure a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to be able to depart for two-year missions without returning to their original port.
However, the ongoing delays mean that these state-of-the-art warships, which are said to boost Germany’s maritime strength, will already be obsolete before they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The F125 frigate was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available on the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that would have made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly significant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future equipment.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz vessel is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective mechanisms, the cost of the entire project, including that of training the crew, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance given the latest warnings that Germany’s maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee in the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy "began to run out of vessels that can be sent on missions."
The official said the problem has steadily increased over time as old vessels have been taken out of service without being replaced with new ones.
He lamented the fact that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class entered service within the Navy.
National Trust spying on the secret life of bats
New research that is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how bats use the environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behavior of these new flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will analyze common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as eared bats and water bats from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and what species emit certain sounds.
A habitat map and a report will also be produced to create a detailed, scaled-up picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas in the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of lawns, and what is the best way to maintain forest pastures for bats and other associated species.
Populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work that affects their nests, as well as habitat loss.
Both wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are fly traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, thinks very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who periodically conduct studies, control nests, and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization has created even the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of bat are found in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
“Here at Threave, the area is great for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are a lot of things we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply.”
It emphasizes the importance of looking for bats before carrying out maintenance work at properties, since the simple unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chicks, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations against him were "fake news" and that some people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and the Juventus team was accused of raping an American woman identified as Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to mention the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live for his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said it was "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said in front of the camera.
“They want to advertise in my name.
It's normal.
They want to become famous by using my name, but I'm used to it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine,” added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these charges, which they have called "an unacceptable report of suspicions about privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for “moral damages equivalent to an appropriate amount for the gravity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was “a good boy” in the proportion of “99 percent,” and that he was betrayed by that “one percent.”
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims she addressed the police and that the photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later accepted a deal outside the courtroom because she was "terrified by the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that "she would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to annul that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain ‘would regret forever’ loss of automakers
Britain “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leader in post-Brexit automotive production, Secretary of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they fear leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “fix on time” principle: for custom-made cars, parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which, according to industrial manufacturers, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more of the inventory for a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company says, so production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future EU relations is “precisely calibrated to avoid these delays at the border.”
“There has to be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told Today on BBC Radio 4.
“Evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue to use what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be halted, but warned that increased prices could reduce the factory’s long-term competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: “Experience has taught me that after I disappear, these jobs don’t come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors of Trump firing the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, have been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But he went to the White House last month, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which again postponed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There has not been a date set yet. It can be this week or it can be postponed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy towards TV reporters, who like to show up, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to show up."
He then suggested that there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president attends more Q&A sessions than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "We've analyzed the figures."
“There will be more briefings,” Sanders said, “but I think it’s much better for the press to have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, not to me.
We try to do this most of the time and you have noticed that we have done this many times in the last few weeks, and discussions with the President of the United States will replace press briefings when it is available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, with an improvised appearance, at odds, in front of the assembled reporters.
A Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health addresses, in a letter, EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on the fears related to Brexit
The secretary of state wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter as it was less than six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to bear the costs for applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, awaiting decision-making this fall.
But the UK government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union, but also outside, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head
Tennessee State Tigers backer Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head on Saturday in a game his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores, scoring 31-27, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State team head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
“He got to the cough line and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on the oxygen mask by physical trainers and medical staff on the cough line before placing it on a bar and transporting it off the ground for a thorough evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operation he was undergoing at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet about the type/extension of the injury” and that the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make a total of five plies before leaving the match, reaching a total of 18 plies throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher court fee on the purchase of a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay a higher court fee when buying a property in the UK, after which the extra money will be used to help homeless people, according to new Conservative Party plans.
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with voting rights
The court stamp fee will be applied to persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of court stamp duty when buying a property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa May is due to announce today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with voting rights, promising more affordable homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher court fee will be applied to individuals and legal entities that are not paying taxes and taxes in the UK, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government’s efforts to help homeless people.
The surcharge, which is added to the current court fee, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and the properties purchased for rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring an increase of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
About 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the court stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major construction firms of keeping property prices high as a result of the purchase of land without using it, and asked Theresa May to waive taxes on affordable homes in order to solve the "home problem" in the UK.
Corbyn has announced a number of proposals for attractive real estate reforms, including rent controls and the cessation of unmotivated evacuations.
It also wants to give councils greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my term as prime minister to fulfilling the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means tackling the existing problems in the real estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair for people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies with offices abroad, to be able to buy houses as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and living in unworthy conditions is far too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be the manager of Scotland's national team"
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said his "final goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of "reviving" the Northeastern club, which is currently ranked 3rd in the First League, with a three-point difference from the first.
He moved to the Light Stadium team this summer after last season's St. Mirren football team's return to the Scottish Premiership first division.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got to the national team B and that's it," Ross told Sportsound.
“But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland’s matches at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I succeed as manager of the club."
Ross' predecessors, as managers of Sunderland, included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he had no emotions to be the successor to such consecrated names at such an important club after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The only thing that worries me and that could affect my success is the question, ‘Can I help this team get back into the Premier League?’
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow him to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get her to get there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club's return to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years of management experience, after a time as assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months as a member of the Hearts training staff.
He then helped Alloa recover after relegating to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship title next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a decisive moment," he said of the club's takeover.
“I thought I was more suited to the role of manager than the role of player.
It may sound strange, because we had a good time, we won well and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel it’s the right role for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do that, I feel like it’s the thing that suits me best in my entire adult life.”
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30, between 12:00 and 13:00 on the broadcast Sportsound from Radio Scotland.
The ideal time to drink a pint of beer is Saturday, at 17:30, according to a survey
This summer’s heatwave has led to an increase in revenue from pubs in the UK, but puts more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the figures, pubs and bars recorded an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s representative providing business consulting services and who conducted the survey, said: “The constant heat and England’s participation in the World Cup for a longer period than expected contributed to a pattern in July, similar to that of the previous month.
The number of customers lower by 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June fell even more in July.
Pubs and bars that serve only drinks have made a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve food have suffered heat losses, but not as large as those in restaurants.
It seems that people went out into the city just to consume drinks.
Sales of beverages at all bars and pubs rose by 6.6% this month, and food fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s representative for the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large-scale sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to suffer losses, although the drop in sales by 4.8% year-on-year will add to the current cost pressures.
The long cannicular summer could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide if the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.”
The total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the reduced number of newly launched locations.
The company, which monitors sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret account on a social network that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children, some up to the age of 11, has a secret account on a social network that he hides from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta” accounts
The news has heightened fears about posts with sexual content
20% of students said they have a “main” account that they show to their parents
One in five children, some up to the age of 11, create an account on a social network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid rise in “fake Insta” accounts, citing Instagram’s photo-sharing platform.
The news has heightened fears about posts with sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main” and “clean” account that they show to their parents, but they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, noted the post of a teenager demanding to be “raped.”
According to research conducted by the UK’s Digital Awareness company and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admit to holding secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of the HMC Association, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don’t have access to.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘Voice of Athletes’ in Scottish Athletes’ Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletes Commission at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make sporting decisions to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys the respect of the entire community of athletes from Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with his inclusion in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle added: "I am delighted that I will be able to represent the athletes and I hope to have a real contribution and to be able to help with the way the sporting activities are carried out in Scotland."
The American athlete, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter sprints at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator at the BBC, and has been invalided after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She tweeted: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will decide if I will recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
A breast pump advertisement that compares women with cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A breast pump manufacturing company has caused the public to split in the online environment with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cow milking.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be “the world’s first silent and portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic ad, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom that the new pump offers to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay for cows on a song that includes lyrics such as, "Yes, I'm sluggish, but I don't have a tail" and "if you haven't noticed, these are not ugliness, but my breasts."
The chorus continues: “I pump, I pump, I pump, I suck babies, I pump, I pump, I extract milk from girls.”
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of them claiming to expose the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
“Like us, they have to stay pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen just a few days after birth.”

Another person commented: “It’s understandable how traumatic it is, both for the mother and the child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added, "An extremely inappropriate advertisement."
Other people defended the ad, one person saying it seemed like a “hilarious” ad.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping really made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad targeting mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the toilets) and who feel like ‘babies’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with discreet pumps inserted into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their children in their arms and even get out into the city while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and design developer at Mother commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what the use of a breast pump entails and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump has reached the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly transferred to a refugee camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of people crossing the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have caused the procedure of placing children at sponsorships to be difficult.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and fear that they will endanger their stay in the country if they request to take children.
The risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80% of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor family live illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of processing children in the system, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which children must appear in court one month after detention, and not 60 days as provided for by the previous standard, according to shelter employees.
Many will plead for the case through a video call, and not in person before an immigration judge, to seek legal residency status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to shelter employees and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are accentuated at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating that a child has problems are not noticed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends could cause them trauma, which many of them are already suffering.
Syria calls for U.S., French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the interim prime minister, said foreign military forces are illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "the situation will be properly managed".
“These must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
“Damascus will continue this sacred fight until we remove terrorist groups and the illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories,” he said.
There are about 2,000 U.S. military troops in Syria, who are particularly involved in training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
Also, in the war-torn country there are more than 1,000 French military troops.
With regard to the refugee issue, Moualem said there are favourable conditions for their return and accused “a few Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears”, which caused the refugees to keep their distance.
He added: “We have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return.”
“Political influences are brought into a problem that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to drive out the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russo-Turkish agreement helped avert a large-scale assault with the help of Syrian forces, backed by the Russians, on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, who have links to the Al-Qaeda network and will "be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy, hopes to meet soon in a first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the committee's activities should be limited to "revising articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning regarding interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Second Term
If we follow this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment procedure or scandals end his term as president earlier, which much of the liberal audience hopes to happen.
In this case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to a presidential term of all time!”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time audiences have doubled at CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the first-time, Fox News is watched by an average of 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was watched by 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people watching it prominently in the evenings in which it was aired.
"This is a topic that attracts the public because we can't understand it," Neal Baer, the producer of ABC's "Backup President" drama series, said of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and the author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can also be holistic about the state of the global economy.
Changing the position is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you’re not just an informed citizen when you get to the sixth hour of watching the “Washington” debate by a committee of experts on how Bob Woodward uses “deep background” (confidential) sources for his book, “Fear,” about the 5,000-year-old Paul’s ostrich leather jacket.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"A lot of what it does makes you feel like you're watching a reality show and it feeds you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "Axes of the Dealer," about the constantly changed distribution and the daily turmoil of football.
Don’t allow yourself to miss an episode, because you’ll feel like you’re left behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his home on the northern shore of Kauai Island, it was 27 degrees outside and there was sunshine, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording on CNN.
He couldn’t get out of the TV, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was to face the Senate’s legal committee and decide the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember doing some out-of-the-ordinary shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it looks like they were right.”

Overwhelming external financial resources for the closest midterm elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of the constituencies, which resulted in two mandate holders in an election race for the same office, it is not at all surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of the Pittsburg district brought Democratic Representative Conor Lamb to the race, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th electoral district, which significantly overlaps with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional, manipulating district boundaries in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th constituency sparked a competition in funding campaigns between major party funding bodies, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a high-profile special election in March for the state's 18th electoral district.
For more than a decade, the office was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district by a 20-point difference.
According to political commentators, democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing the state of El Salvador for its deal with China, but then resigned.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until partners evacuated the Trump Organization leadership team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to call U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were considered only against the state of El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included financial aid cuts and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and crime in it.
As internal meetings have made progress, officials in North and Central America have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the migration of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions on El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, wanting to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic deliberations only if they remain anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an outside analyst, who is a close associate of the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Study of History
The next thing that could happen is Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on President Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now solid evidence made public.
It also appears that Mueller is also targeting his investigation into the existence of a conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and Russia regarding the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face due accountability within the body, even as he prepares to appear before voters and possibly a jury made up of his peers.
There are many possible situations and I don’t want to suggest that a “fall” of Trump is inevitable, which is also true for his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will decide the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to give a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a few such critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this paper that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times' report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light sabbath candles on the table with swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Player Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match with the Austrians, after Spain’s impressive draw against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place it in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season until 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game with the thought that we would get a good result and we won a point.
Probably we could have scored in the end, but overall, I think the draw was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we were better in the second.
Thursday will once again be an important night for Europe.
With a little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last match played. However, having the support of the fans, we will certainly feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
"Last year was clearly a difficult one, given my injuries and the changes at the club, but the situation is better right now.
The team is fine and the guys really like to be here; the training also goes well.
Let’s hope that we will persevere, that we will leave behind what happened in the last season and that we will have good results.”
Women Have Insomnia Due to Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of them said they had talked to their children about this topic.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t initiate this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide you with the care you need if you don’t make your wishes known in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in setting costs.
Involve your financial adviser: and the financial adviser can be a real help in terms of paying these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care can include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses or you can insure your own well-being – as long as you have the money.
Set up your legal documents: come in to deal with issues of a legal nature.
Get an authority on medical decisions to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you can’t communicate them.
You should also consider exercising an authority on your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and who will make sure that your bills are paid, if you do not have the necessary capacity to do so.
Do not forget the small details: imagine that a parent of yours at an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not all about the financial side. Can you tell me who the doctors are who handle it?” asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of your dog?
Write a plan for all of these things.”
A man was shot several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed air gun as he was walking home after a night in the city.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2:30 a.m., as “random shooting.”
The victim was unable to see the attacker.
The injuries did not endanger his life, and the police called on witnesses to make statements.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, authorities dealing with disasters were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area in the northern city of Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow gulf on the west coast of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that stretches on a coast with an area of more than 300 km in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, an administrative region located at the bottom of a province, has a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming activities represent the central point of the province’s economy in the centre of Sulawesi Island, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining activities are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Donggala regency, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Circle of Fire, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra Island, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale hit the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra Island, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in Aceh’s Pidie Jaya Regency, causing damage and panic as people recalled the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami that claimed a large number of lives.
This time, a tsunami was not triggered, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapsed buildings.
2018: Several strong earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stuck under the wreckage.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska’s former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaskan state police.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance of him tried to call the police to claim the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in police custody at the Mat-Su unit, pending trial, and is being held on the basis of an unsecured bail of $500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "100% innocent" when he was asked to plead, according to the network.
Palin faces three class A criminal charges, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, which is punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with such a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, being involved in a complaint of a crime of domestic violence and possessing a gun while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend’s statement, he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress disorder he suffers from after being part of the Iraqi military.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred off the central province of Sulawesi, which lies in the northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social networks there are videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecutor wants the death penalty for the suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The federal prosecutor in New York wants capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, apparently used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on its trajectory in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and caused “intentionally” serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent on the death penalty request filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both indictments can receive a capital sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a top federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts that include eight counts of organized crime murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out the act as “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, sufferings and losses to the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuzcco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in New York's Southern District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he liked what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of the ISIS group on his phone, according to the claimant.
According to police, he also asked to carry the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the office defenders who represented Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty, instead of accepting a plea of guilt with life in prison, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team has previously asked the prosecutor’s office not to apply capital punishment.
A Member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party argues that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has vowed to “mobilize the civilian army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel pressure" from eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of parliament Theresa May who suggested that he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the UK “would have come out” by now if Farage was secretary during the Brexit campaign.
But May’s challenge to the highly divided camps has been accentuated by members of the Conservative Party who have joined another protest against the European Union’s exit from the city.
The prime minister is trying hard to ensure that his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, is carried out properly, facing attacks from those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to stay in it, as well as from the European Union.
The Allies stressed that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and “chaos.”
Bone said at the “Leave Means Leave” pro-Brexit movement event in Solihull that he wants “the Chequers plan to be abandoned.”
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If things were driven by him, we were no longer in the European Union,” he said.
The Conservative member of Parliament, the representative of the Wellingborough constituency, added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied suggestions of changing public opinion in the 2016 vote: “It is not at all true that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
“The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it, nor our activists who take to the streets and support us, first and foremost, in the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message to Theresa May, she added: “The prime ministers who retain their office are those who keep their promises.”
At the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to “feel the pressure” if they are about to renounce the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we’re not going to let them do that.”
In a message of enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the civilian army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that read “The Conservative Party is against Brexit” after the group launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party’s application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the digitization of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a farce.
“Brexit has no benefits,” he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future Saturday during a town hall meeting in the western state of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running to be re-elected in the November election against Geoff Diehl, a member of the House of Representatives from the Republican Party, who was co-chair of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could beat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with citizens with voting rights using the mayoral format since Trump took over as president.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come for “women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our severely affected government, and that includes a woman at the head of the government.”
Suspect arrested in case of death that caused the death of the Sims player from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the death that resulted in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene, that he was in possession of a gun, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 1.98m-tall junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the original lot last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will play a key role in the race.
Being in first place in the standings, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to stop at boxing and left Hamilton at the queue of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the pits a lap later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after several schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free, after making a double move to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the race in the rear row of the carousel and was in seventh place near the end of the first lap, right on the day he turned 21.
Then he was in the lead for much of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
Eventually, he stopped at boxing on the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the last eight rounds, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
“It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me go ahead.
And the team did an excellent job to get the victory over Ferrari and to achieve this double,” Hamilton said.
Terrible body language
President Donald Trump ironized Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday at a rally over her insistence that she had not facilitated the “leakage” of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter, which accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown people to be “bad, immoral, and liars.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and liars,” he said.
“When you see that they published and leaked information and then say that they didn’t.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember that?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the "leakage" of the document?
Do you remember her answer? He said, umm..poftim?
Aaa... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
“No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senators.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and was "leaked" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "leaked" occurred from her office.
"I have not concealed the accusations against Ford, and I am not the one who facilitated the leaking of her account," Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep my privacy and that’s exactly what I did.”
But her denial didn’t seem to have fallen well for the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the most horrible body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing the defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusations to achieve their own ends.
“They are determined to take power in every possible way.
Observe evil, immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee’s Stars team wins 5-3 against Belfast’s Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars paid for Friday's loss in the Elite League, winning against the Belfast Giants in Saturday's return game, with a 5-3 score in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead, with the strikes being run by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the score before Dwyer returned the Giants to the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard equalled the score for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat this season for Adam Keefe’s players, who had regained ground by defeating the Dundee team 2-1 on Friday evening.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening spectacle kicked off in the fourth minute and 3:35, respectively, from a pass by Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford moved decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a match that started so dynamically, Sullivan brought the host team back into play in the 13:10 minute, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie the opportunity to score for an equal score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first pause, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first half.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard again equalled an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later, in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus securing the team's climb to 5th place in the standings, in the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will be hosting Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller has died after insuring the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after insuring the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong aftershocks in the area and many people are trapped under the remains of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower in Palu, which shook strongly.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that it was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s air navigation service provider said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital from another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We are saddened by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency saying access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will increase because many of the victims are still under the ruins and we have not had access to many of them," the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said in a statement.
Waves as high as six meters have devastated the city of Palu, a joint funeral is scheduled to take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings victims.
It is almost impossible to find drinking water.
All mini-markets are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to provide help to the survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has now said one person is missing, having previously said all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger had been missing since Saturday afternoon.
She also said she was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional passenger details, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while it was trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane missed the runway and landed in a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has passed the end of the runway.
U.S. Nationality passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very short distance from the ground.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the waist, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the passengers were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to renovate a disembarkation craft jumped into relief, using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank 30 meters underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered in the PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office closed its plea in retrial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the recordings on his mobile phone to put Quinton Tellis, 29, and his 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting her previous claims, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
The moment the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called into the witness box and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis stated that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Recordings on mobile phones indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final pleading on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide at the end of the day.
The High Breed: What is Hip-Hop Consciousness?
A trio that plays hip-hop music wants to change the negative way this kind of music is seen, with the help of songs with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band The High Breed argues that hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social issues as it originally did.
They want to go back to their origins and make hip-hop popular again.
A recent revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common has been observed in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A New York babysitter sues a couple for firing her after she received a “racist” text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple for dismissal on discriminatory grounds after mistakenly receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denied that they were racist, claiming that she sued him for “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her dissatisfaction when she learned that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first showed up for work in 2016.
"NUUUUU! AGAIN A COLOUR PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the guffaw, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, did not perform her duties properly and that she had expected to receive a suitable babysitter to the Post.
Maurice was paid for the day’s work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple to be awarded compensation for dismissal and demands the amount of $350 per day for six months, the period during which she had to live with them and carry out her work, despite the fact that this was done without a contract concluded.
“I want to show them that such things are not being done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s about discrimination.”
The couple denies claims they are racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent him the wrong message.
He is not a racist person.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco, her husband, told the Post newspaper.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you were wrong about, even if by mistake?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Considering the trial an “extortion” action, Plasco said his wife would give birth in two months and that she was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person in such circumstances?
This is not the case,” added the banker.
While the process is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for the behavior and logic they have demonstrated.
The publishers of Paddington’s story have feared that readers will not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s very funny now, after seeing that Paddington had a huge success.”
She also said her father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was a "sweet year" after his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success he later enjoyed.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington the credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
On landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad often calls to tell me that he’s very serious and doesn’t think he’s going to survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, “Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications given by doctors to keep her heart pumping blood began to diminish and come out of her body.
It had died a short time ago and the organs were starting to stop working.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was happening.
I couldn’t scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the death of his daughter, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I kept my head down and my tears didn’t stop flowing.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized that she needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two grieving women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost their loved ones because they committed suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and include phone numbers that people can call for support.
Sharon Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was to be a promising chef with a dazzling smile.
“Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said that his smile changed your mood.”
However, he gave up work before he died, as he had arrived at a very unfortunate moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still thinking it's going to have a domino effect."
It created the messages “to convey to people that they can call someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Exteriorize yourself, you need to talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' longtime friend, lost Mark, her life partner, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or that he was depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he had changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children unpacked their gifts and didn’t even look them in the eye.”
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but she must overcome it: “It caused a huge pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is at stake as a result of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for – a limited, small-scale investigation – we could have little unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was about to “disintegrate” against the backdrop of a partisan blockade.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reticence is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks until the Nov. 6 election – if, as expected, Republicans have poor results, their attempts to place the one they want as the winner in the country’s highest court elections will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush continued to appeal to senators to persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make a difference in the case of equality and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has fallen under Kim's leadership.
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said about 1,127 people fled the country last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by those who illegally transport people across the border.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of refugees in the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily demilitarized protected zone (DMZ) between the two sides of Korea.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for several talks that were the subject of denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Singapore’s Kim Jong-un, when they agreed, in general terms, to work together for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. sanctions of causing a lack of progress since then.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security, and in such situations, we won’t be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and says he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court as "hysterical" and said his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if she was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and losing his voice due to emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him “a grotesque and coordinated character assassination” organized by the rabid liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony showed he can't serve in the Supreme Court because he showed he has a biased character against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I just want to say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it’s not appropriate, not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Wow, how wonderful!’” Pelosi said.
And women need to be able to handle it.
It is a justified diatribe, there are months and years of accumulated anger and cannot speak without bursting into tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, is it?”
She continued: "I received significant help from a woman in an executive position, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm three.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
It seemed like a brilliant thing.”
Tears are allowed for the exteriorization of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a men-dominated office, where I began to cry because of an inexpressible rage, is that I was grabbed by the neck of an older woman, a cold directional one that I always felt a little scared of, and took me to the house.
“They should never see you crying,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
I think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they caused you that feeling.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason not to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” she says, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was over, she was behind with the fundraiser and vowed not to enter the race unless she manages to raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000, they were only giving her $250.
“Do they think I’m getting discounts?” she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by emotions – as a result of the gratitude to the people who supported her, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters in place of delegates, but also the anger of the market caused by gender discrimination.
“You would have said I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the media’s reactions to her.
“You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex.”
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my gravestone.
“And crying?”
How can Beijing benefit from the trade war between the United States and China?
The owls that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China have been deafening, and while there seems to be a long way to go before it ends, disputes between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation occurred this week with new taxes, affecting products worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively levied on half of all Chinese goods arriving in the United States.
Beijing has each avenged itself, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10 percent on U.S. products worth $60 billion.
China has warned it will respond to every blow from the United States and is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly ceding to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. pressure on the trade war could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would, in fact, be more dangerous than has been expected so far,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the conditions on the ground are more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things return to normal.
Existing conditions allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011 when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded its sixth consecutive win in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe came back in first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts in much of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial shot into the water to hair 3 at hole 16, ceding the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all the innings, becoming one of the four players with a score of 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, since 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost in the 5th and 4th holes to the last-placed player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The first-placed player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost to England's Ian Poulter in the 2nd and 1st holes, probably his last Ryder Cup match.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with the most victories, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and that he believed in me.
I am very happy that I was able to win the cup again.
It’s teamwork and I’m glad I could be of help,” Garcia said, excited after the European victory.
He hands over the relay to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud that I beat Tiger Woods, and I used to watch his games when I was a kid,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team put in a real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great throughout the tournament.
The captain of the American team, Jim Furyk, said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of them, they really worked.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a heart-to-heart fight.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
We must give them due respect.
They played better than us.”
