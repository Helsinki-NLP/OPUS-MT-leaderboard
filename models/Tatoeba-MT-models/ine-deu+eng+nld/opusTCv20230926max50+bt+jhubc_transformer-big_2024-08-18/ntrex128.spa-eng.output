Members of the Assembly (AM) of Wales are concerned about "seeing like muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This confusion stems from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his group was concerned "that he would stay with Twp and Pwp".
For readers from outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A member of the Welsh Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "discontented" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that MWP's pronunciation leap to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the naming of the Members of the Assembly will be the matter of the Members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option garnered most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could head over to the Speaker of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say on the question of what they should be called when discussing legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighboring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price you have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the older people I’ve spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one thing nor the other."
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way,” he says.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that the neighbors go to regularly."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money raised from the sale of goods will not last as long as leaders expect and that “sooner or later, they will return to the starting point.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the type of people who will not help the shrines remaining in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and will therefore speed up the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will end up being members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshipping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took over St. Martin, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street merchants, a major shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while Father Johnson’s parishioners were making plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the lane.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called it "the campaigns of the poor".
In July, the expert who played the railing called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first railing in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left to play the largest Riverside Church railing, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish junta, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the junta, although it had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Who Snorkeled in Search of Lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the day the lobster season opened, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV channel that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help, so he approached with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited to have caught a lobster, but then realized that "he was screaming that he had been bitten by a lobster.
,
He had his collarbone shattered," Hammel observed when he reached the boy's side.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans boost UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the hallways of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2,800bn and with growth going up compared to falling sales in fashion and household goods, the largest beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if they overcome it successfully, the same will be done in more stores.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be testing its concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift to daily shopping for small amounts of food in local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s chief executive, has said stores will increasingly look like malls as the supermarket chain tries to combat discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points of sale in hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is believed to have boosted grocery sales and further profitable these acquisitions.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to split the revenues of pharmaceutical outlets in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of Sainsbury’s 281 pharmaceutical facilities to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, while an attractive environment and convenient location makes us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is 'angry' after Holly Willoughby breaks <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones went "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby broke an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion and accessories brand Truly.
This business had compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by leaving his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "angry" when the gold television girl admitted that her new deals, valued at up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, did not leave time to dedicate themselves to Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was profiled as a favorite to double Willoughby’s fortune of about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As a source said, “Truly was, by far, Holly’s top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her going for the next two decades.
Their decision to leave left all involved totally stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters, ready-to-sell products."
Experts believe the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that last night “we didn’t talk about business issues.”
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented with his mocking voice as a “news presenter.”
“I haven’t given up on anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in reuniting with him after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate response” from the US to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, help to free hostages and bring the remains of U.S. soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but so instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to the people standing right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population had to move, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not requesting international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” explains Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are still not sure whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not as many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami alert sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling from one island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has made upgrading Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure the central axis of his election campaign, and has earmarked a lot of money for roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko’s administration, which faces a re-election next year.
In addition, it must face pressure from Indonesia’s persistent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge equalises the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 meters from the Chelsea goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second stick.
The action sent him over the area and headed towards the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very well ahead, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think about it too much, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midfielder made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before spinning by making a regatta near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle of the field.
Afterwards, he made a nice pass to the space that led Hazard to the area.
Hazard placed in front of the defense and ended up throwing the ball into the second-post net with a left-footed kick that Liverpool's Alisson Becker could not stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The meeting will be held at the San Paolo Stadium, in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country’s emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of the buildings that collapsed during the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and sparked waves of up to six meters, the agency’s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man as murder suspect after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, which involved the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who had been near John Street, in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to catch something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman came to the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim's family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his apartment, but police tell him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed to re-enter in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the spot in tears.
I keep saying "it's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the lace and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon controlling the floor block.
Anyone who has information is asked to send an email to DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, registration 247 of September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue becomes the latest commemorative success for "rewriting history"
Their prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that taking Oliver Cromwell out of the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Cromwell may be sacrificed wrongly for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, an advocate of parliament under external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If this is an entirely accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Pig Killer Attacks Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a rancher at a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified solely by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered in blood near a stall at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as the South China Morning Post newspaper reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs from a piglet in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby shed was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-pound pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and shattered,” the cousin, who is referred to by his last name, “Wu,” told The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, it is not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 295-pound pig cornered a rancher on his tractor until his wife scared the animal.
After pigs ate an Oregon rancher in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What you have to do is to have the right respect for them," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy rains widespread in the southwestern U.S.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind gusts of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane from Sunday to five in the morning (Eastern Time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressures are beginning to build in the Pacific Ocean, shifting eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push intense tropical rains northward toward the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain collides with the low pressure approaching, there will be strong widespread rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and possible spills in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation of nearly 5 to 8 centimetres per hour in specific areas, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding may occur with rapidly aggravating conditions.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not at all recommended to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into swirling rivers and storms will cause bursting winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rains on specific parts of Southern California’s coast.
The torrential rains may leave up to nearly two centimeters of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slippery.
These would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains are widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes in the U.S. may be observed due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this involves drastic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. center on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and, Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and re-expand.
In much of central and eastern America, a warm start to October is expected, with widespread temperatures around 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures in New York could reach up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high odds of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the appearance of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed the heartbreaking testimonies that Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, gave on Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, politics remained at a standstill and the media interrupted their usual programming to rebroadcast Friday’s latest news: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a drunken state and that he tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people Nielsen commented on Friday have seen it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it’s a similar audience to an American football game in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose tertullians have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fuels the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters screaming at him as he tried to climb an elevator to attend an appearance before the Judiciary Commission.
While receiving these reprimands, broadcast live on CNN, he was shocked.
“Looking at my face,” one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
And he said, “You have power when there are many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, that it would tell more in his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and radio broadcasters broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judiciary Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Senate to vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate over the next week, which some Democrats had been asking for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was fundamental, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of ‘Doing Politics’ With Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "politicalizing" Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers' alleged Brexit plan, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to levy each other's tariffs was "totally absurd".
Wayde Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson’s DNA in them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A $350,000 bond has been set, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge District Court of Inquiry released a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a gunshot wound to the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police forensics lab, Southern University police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's sports director, thanked the local police forces for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“These are the things people always care about,” Wade said.
A volcano throws ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakings.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity on the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence demonstrators faced riots as thousands of people participated in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by rioters threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also clashes in later hours and police used clubs to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with messages such as "neither forgetting nor forgiveness", faced unionist protesters shouting "Viva Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid, but held by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although participation was low, as people opposed to the secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes occurred.
Pro-independence groups camped Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but she was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia to become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit narrow, victory in last December’s regional elections, pro-Catalan parties have struggled to retain momentum this year as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detained, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pretrial detention since late last year, announced that he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for ambushing a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a Londonderry home with a car.
The incident occurred around 7:30 p.m. on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the entrances and the building itself.
At some point, you may have shot the car with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by getting the second loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
The attack of Dolly Menga marked the difference. Gary Holt's team climbed a position, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, the Gerrards have yet to make any home wins and next Sunday they face the Hearts, who lead the table with eight points.
Earlier, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their winning streak in the division to six games. Holt, the starting coach, has not yet tasted the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a blunt visitor
Holt's team had to have gone one step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of trouble to the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson overtook the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the goal. Afterwards, Alan Lithgow got the diverted shot after internalizing to finish Craig Halkett's header center in front of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for visitors with the ball still.
This is how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston sought an entry, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers were dominating the possession, but could not pass the defense of the host and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
That game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Allan McGregor, goalkeeper of the Rangers rejected Scott Pittman's shot with a kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another play by Livingston.
Long passes entered the Livingston area constantly, but were always cleared; two penalty requests were rejected, one after Halkett's entry over substitute Glenn Middleton and the other for one hand.
Livingston's "Phenomenal" (analysis)
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have barely experienced changes since his rise, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good moments with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the moves, as they only managed to get into the opposing field once, which is a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers personified themselves in the immediate vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by paramedics, but died there.
The accident comes after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that ran away on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from the crash site on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured after riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation in a high-security men's prison, according to the prison's management.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Experts from an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight interns are involved and affecting a pavilion.
The officers were assisted by minor injuries to the face on the spot.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be placed in the hands of the police and could spend more time in jail.”
The Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, riot police were asked to go to prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It’s unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the last gatherings of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest of the desert, at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rains at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only “ten hurricanes had preserved their tropical storm or depression state within a radius of 321 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rain, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollon Scarp, Arizona.
They are likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, the rains of Rosa can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions that are currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s itinerary will batter Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum bursts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to recede in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout Monday afternoon.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
“We expect torrential rains of between 7 and 15 centimetres from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimetres,” according to weather.com.
Afterwards, Rosa will head north of Mexico like a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Later, she will travel through Arizona to southern Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is heavy torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden flooding and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested as suspects in a murder attempt after another 16-year-old boy was found with white gun wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
Agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened to the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the meekness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered the pettiness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this allegation.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s cunning, quality, and courage.”
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a lawyer with an admirable record at the service of the public,” he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy when speaking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
"Five weeks are left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t show up, but it’s a race,” he said.
"That's why I'm going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates."
Trump claimed the Democrats were embarking on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami, Number Rises
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves sweeping the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When a tsunami was warned yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), told a news conference.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything on land," Nugroho said. The tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s big earthquake was 200 times that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the 300km coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Donggala's communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information," Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received much criticism for not reporting that a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a video captured by a fan and shared on social media, one hears a man on the top floor of a building telling people that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, taking forward buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately validate the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but people evacuated still need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although Donggala’s World Vision staff have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under tarpaulins installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they’d seen a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as the aid groups put the disaster assistance gears into operation, some people complained that the movement to Palu of co-operators with extensive experience was not being allowed.
According to Indonesian law, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a Red Cross spokesman in Indonesia.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn’t happened yet.”
Falling the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of people who were still missing still had hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the devastating stories that write natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandon, an instructor for Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
“From my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the disclosure of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the festival held on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a check mark in gray, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during an ATM recharge in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed a Brink employee who was charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the leisure center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man “came running behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money destined for recharging.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the place, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will begin to call himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: “The person formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has long been dubbed Ye, a name he used as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
“I think it’s the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year as he talked about the album’s title with Big Boy radio station.
"I'm you, I'm us, it means us.
It went from being Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in uppercase or lowercase, with or without a script.
The Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against the civilian population, as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country approaches.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would “never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were consolidating throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He claimed that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding for I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and I.A. professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments are followed by I.A.-related announcements from various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the No. 1 innovation in IA by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I.A.’s research would be a good start, given that all other countries go far behind the U.S. We have a look at the next advance in the field of I.A.,” says Lee.
Double funding means twice as likely that the next big achievement in I.A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most important I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that beat Othello’s best American player. He was subsequently an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee gave recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the next one, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired university executives to work at I.A.
Lee commented that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its initiatives in I.A.
“I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically,” he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to attract industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a US$2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held on Sunday whether their name will change to "Republic of North Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidacy for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, a majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has called into question whether participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
On the ballot paper of the referendum was posed the following question: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, quite a few Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at one o'clock in the afternoon, no irregularities had been reported.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko filed their vote in the Macedonian referendum on a change of name of the country that would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs in front of the tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would bring the investment Macedonia so much needs, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters were going to participate in the referendum, which means a smaller turnout than required.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Manchester City's Sergio Agüero evades the entire Brighton defence to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling broke the defence of Brighton in the 2-0 win Manchester City won Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three defences of Brighton before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded a defender before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Agüero has some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League competition.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball well within the territory of Brighton.
He made a nice ball pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before directing Sterling towards the second stick.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net just before he crossed the line.
The City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to tread the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, who have triumphed against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League, still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard position thanks to a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still pursue their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, we can at least step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t you want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but they seem inclined to let Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his opening number 34, did a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed history is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump here and meeting in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when speaking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks are left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the most important. I don't introduce myself, but it's a race, so I'm going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates," he said.
“We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see the pettiness, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
“We’ve seen it these last four days,” he said, saying the Democrats “were furious, they were bad, they were horrible and they were fake.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Commission by naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received public accolades.
“Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I expect an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of opinions.
He is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, I was barely surprised.
After all, I am the last of a row of Labour Party Members of Parliament who are told they are not welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a treatment similar to being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible national security economic policy on Europe, and ironically, these were issues where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years in which I have been a Member of Parliament of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been like.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a “more kind and kind” policy is already more than forgotten, if it really applied at some point.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether or not party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to hope that he would radically change his mind and adopt positions he would never have agreed to, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my retirement, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every “censorship” motion or every change in selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice that advised me to keep my head down and not make myself heard so much and that it would be “okay.”
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a high school student, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that literally left the classroom of my integral school in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a government minister.
I have never concealed my political ideas, not even in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political stances or the areas in which I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my allegiance to the leader of the Labour Party when the country heads to a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the electorate, whether from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will stop me from acting as I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the game may have decided to some extent the final result, but Ayr certainly deserved the victory in this most entertaining game of the day of the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten that participate.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to better take advantage of the opportunities, that gave the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been tested in every game and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie commented, “The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute rehearsal, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, a Warriors loan for the game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this opponent's disadvantage and Jason Baggot got an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended the Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, just in half, he scored and turned a solo rehearsal, which left the score in 17-5 in favor of the Ayr in the break.
However, the Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
There was then a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, whom they had to pull out on a stretcher, and as the match resumed, the Ayr advanced with a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed the Melrose to retake that they had another man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine rehearsal, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for scoring Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made a rehearsal when he was in the back of the advancing maul.
Climo converted him, as he had been doing almost since the match resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong with a kick and sent Gregor Henry to the bottom to do the fifth rehearsal of the locals.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the restaurant sector
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems determined to move into the catering sector after it is revealed that he has been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the BBC's famous show, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though a Scottish Sun source said Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "blossoming restaurant market."
"The sea belongs to us": a Bolivia without a coastline hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings waving navy blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
“Recovering it is a duty.”
Across Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly recall the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the desire to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a resolution by the International Court of Justice for October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the International Court of Justice’s ruling on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is waging a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have numbed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would use the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never relinquish its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to bring nuclear disarmament to an end if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to deliver on promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume paralyzed nuclear diplomatic talks more than three months after this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to subdue the North is a "chimera."
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without Pyongyang first making any significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, widespread skepticism reigns over Pyongyang’s seriousness of renouncing an arsenal that the country probably considers to be the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the presidents.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a set of eccentric oversized hats for their 2019 spring-summer collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers enveloping the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories were jeweled watermelons, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation was reminiscent of a full dive team, including snorkeling and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big-sized fashion, you're in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could start to be seen on the streets of shops.
The big hats arrive stepping hard by hand from "The Bomb", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters worn by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this so impractical hat that flooded social networks presented another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag as big as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on the commercial streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: Language Competencies are Essential for the Citizens of the World
Scotland’s independent educational centres have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary exam results that is reinforced by individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is noted that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the centers.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, it reaches to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can observe that languages are at the top of the ranking tables, with the highest rates of approved in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centres that are part of the SCIS, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as a fundamental competence that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, as a subject, languages are considered to be at the same level as CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills revealed that, of the reasons given by employers for the difficulties they encountered in covering jobs, 17 % were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Potential job opportunities that require languages are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically get ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools you will always be able to choose between several languages taught by teaching staff specialized in this field.
Scotland’s independent educational centres dedicate all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At the moment, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages remain vitally important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered “competencies for international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career I don’t need preseason games to prepare,” he said.
Time of Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops at locations with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate’s confirmation vote to fill the pending Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s appearances this week that were strained over allegations of sexual misconduct and have left an early Senate confirmation vote on hold for at most a week as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections gain momentum.
President Trump’s campaign noted that the five rallies next week are intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena stadium, tonight’s rally could attract supporters of “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have media coverage in Pittsburgh,” as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"For Morrisey it's not a good sign that the president has to come to give him a push in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates that it dares to fight to keep hope alive in the face of Sunday’s individual matches.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pulse pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
“They took us six points and now they take us four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in favor and plenty of reasons to be excited, among other reasons for the pair of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
The gutural cries of celebration rose in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt given to them by the match on the 15th was met with a similar cry, from those who transmit that they believe the American team has not yet been left out.
"What needs to be done is to redouble efforts and focus on the game," Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple from Europe has four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way it flows its energy with the bustling public makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun goes down on Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Yet it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four balls, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not get out.
But on Sunday there will be no help getting out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see up close because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the tips they give and those they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big head start to the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe advances 10-6 on last day of Ryder Cup
Europe left with a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 result over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the competition with two wins over a Tiger Woods in trouble, leading by four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which finished 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to beat a discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a round 5-4.
Woods, who hadn't scored too much in both Saturday's games, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes matches, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to be Henrik Stenson's foursome partner, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and number three respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have it all on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as references to the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored an exciting 2-1 win against Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the initial two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovering from a four-point difference in individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs one draw to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their means.
North Korea says “there is no chance” of them disarming unilaterally first if they don’t have confidence
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened its mistrust in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had taken "important measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any similar response from the United States," he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances, there’s no chance that we will disarm unilaterally first.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as he did not without further ado reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose coercively, including by objecting to a declaration of war termination,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader announced at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, the leader of South Korea, over the past five months, and added: “If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stagnation.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles toward U.S. soil after “malign president” Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim “rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in advancing disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions needed to continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set deadline for this: “It may take two years, three years, or five months, no matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without default until we realize definitive and fully verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea denounced his "demands were those of a mobster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the U.S. enforces “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all college students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing sexist culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, is believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
Her motivation to start the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she just heard about this now, in her final year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basics about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression, and cancer.
Afterwards, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it’s not going to change the behavior of students right away.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He asserted that the culture of pride for “spending the night sailing” still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure that students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and a good quality sleep should be “the secret weapon” for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, which is why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
He expects the next step to be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's Goal Graves Gerrard's Men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression away from home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox wanted to get their first win away from home since the 4-1 February victory at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as coach, leaving his team eight points from the Hearts, mouthful leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack occurred minutes before halftime and the Rangers' uninspired lineup was not up to date at any time.
Now, the Rangers are down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers may find themselves in more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after someone allegedly threw an object from the visitor’s background.
Gerrard switched to eight of the starters who won the match against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 players from Livingston who scored a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his highly organized team drowned opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when he had it.
They should have scored within two minutes of the start, when Menga made a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs drew a deep foul for Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send her off the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored two goal shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely struggled to cope with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's boring pitch.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by Livingston came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with a deep Jacobs standoff.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact as the steering wheel was handed over to Morelos, but the stunning Kelly stepped off his line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the type of game he liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's could have taken more advantage more in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a header corner that didn't enter.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a bout with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger accountant
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTAINING... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger accountant, who has since been a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Crown Bells", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of jeans scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
By putting on your headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw how her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a diatribe in favor of Trump with a MAGA cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was stunned in the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to despotize against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to someone white and ask how I can like Trump if he’s racist.
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not rebroadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's bronca to social media.
It’s unclear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the release.
In addition, West told the audience that he had gone wrong behind the scenes for wearing that cap.
“They messed with me.
I was told not to go out with my cap on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how asleep I am?" and added that he was "going to put on his superman coat, because that meant that no one could tell him what he had to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments were received by the public on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: "The studio was totally silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West baffled many when he went out on stage to sing I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of conservative TPUSA group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING BEFORE DUMBER."
Karen Hunter, host of an interview program, tweeted that West was simply “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying their music or their clothes, or supporting their art) who I think is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology to my community.
He's free.
We too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now “the person formerly known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, not forgetting the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The D.A. will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the male hero stereotype, saying those screen roles often conveyed to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes “something has gone wrong” and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones casting partner, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels “quite important” to address this issue.
"Personally, I think it's pretty important right now, where have we been wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?”
Kit believes that television can have part of the responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its so masculine characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any Game of Thrones prequel or sequel when the series ends next summer, stating that he is "tired of battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard’s play that tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he has brought out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly throughout parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has decreased in almost its entirety, Chinese health authorities said at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT group suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from Republican Party senators and claims it was “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three U.S. senators from the Republican Party on Wikipedia pages about lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were driven by commentators and “extreme right” websites.
"Liars, lies and more vile lies," Waters said in a tweet.
Allegedly, the information published included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unidentified Capitol official posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel session regarding allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place sometime after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with Waters’ office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This groundless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Deny this information with anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests not the temperance needed to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t get angry.
He must not rebel.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
It must maintain calm and serenity.”
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters’ reaction with the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of appearing too angry during Thursday’s appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to bankrupt Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations.”
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they are held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Review: Rowan Atkinson's Spy's Parody Gets Short
Now it has become a tradition to look for nods to Brexit in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what it corresponds to to do with this new installment of the parody action and comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-satisfaction about how clearly crazy we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his high-pitched eyes and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to kick in for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematographic territories.
Of course, it’s the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions to shed glamor, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that kind that played a single note on the theme of Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, its origins were based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in the already forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last installment, there are one or two good times.
I loved watching Johnny English approach a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor as the propellers collided with the helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is striking, but the humor is rather short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that “serious” movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comical ingredients seamlessly.
The humor seems more aimed at children than adults, and to me, the absurd misfortunes of Johnny English are not as ingenious and successful as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated current argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all his active agents at the consternation of the in-service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and curly character who is watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character who is almost like Theresa May, but the script leaves little room for work.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to turn to someone who is retired.
That has to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a pissy school, although he gives unofficial lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a rock school-like espionage academy.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his long-suffering accomplice Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a sympathetic role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not taken advantage of enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house.
Definitely, they were used thoroughly in that last sequence, but, however funny and creepy it may be, the ensemble continues to convey a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but charges five per week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business owners to allocate savings made thanks to the AI revolution to workers, giving them an additional day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea "would fit" into the party's plans and economic agenda to tilt the country in favor of workers.
This change to a four-day week has received Congressional support as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: A revision of the directive is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day working week is definitely an issue that the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to back such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, for the time being, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and will not be discussed at this time.”
The shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference held last week to expose his idea of carrying out a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to regain powers of “anonymous directors” and “exploited” from companies that provide utilities.
The shadow minister’s plans also include the idea that current shareholders of water companies will not regain their full stake, since a Labour government could apply deductions that would correspond to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds in which 10% of private sector companies’ shares are allocated to employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice for at least a week and also raises the question of whether the outcome could influence any Republican senator who ultimately decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could bring out information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that the allegation came out, and I asked him, ‘Did you do it?’
He was firm, resolute, tacit.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immovable.
“I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the indictment,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett sharply denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she names have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival where an impressive star billboard gathers in favor of an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people travel to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved 12 years from reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of so-called “criminalism,” which is called the position we take when we think we’re doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have succeeded in having world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2,250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its shares, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", an association of UK-based investors and executives united with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential". To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 2,700 Citiz contributors.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice from malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition’s ambassador, told the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we believe can be done to address extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator said: “It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the movements for human rights and against apartheid have already achieved, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the performances we will have at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to carry out blockade on Russia's energy exports - Home
“If necessary,” Washington could turn to its navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the request of legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, just as they are with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe," he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
“The United States, with its navy, has the ability to ensure that shipping lanes remain open and, where appropriate, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up in the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people attending an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to tap into and replace fuels,” he warned, adding that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relieve the function of Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration members, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says will make Berlin hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has at all times insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which reaches a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project responds only to economic motives and is a further demonstration of unfair competition.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, last September in Moscow.
The American stance has, however, met with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The industry-leading organisation in Germany, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting recently held between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will look closely at the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally have women among the leaders,” he said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during an appearance in the City Hall and said he was "taking the country the wrong way."
“I’m really worried about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren stated that “it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote.”
On Thursday, a poll was published in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run for election in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
However, 32% of respondents did support his candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party discussed the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation that my son is going through, for everything that has happened since he came back, is very well known to the other families who suffer the effects of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers are returning with,” he told the audience who gathered at a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to the arrest as the big taboo no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all other members of the military, have given their country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 States, D.C. Support Challenge to Achieve New Asylum Policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district filed a "friendly" letter Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name has not been disclosed in the Grace v. Sessions case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner “and her children, who are members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision by the Board of Migrant Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum in the country.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
“According to federal law, all asylum applications must be unsuccessful on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” reads the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also indicated in the letter that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by stating that they often become entrepreneurs more often and “assume a necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“People who leave their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or threats on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion can apply for asylum,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to comfort her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Each minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search among the few drowned belongings they have left in an effort to recover what they can.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, also damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to continuous, also very strong, replicas.
She couldn’t help but cry when she told us about the violent earthquake she experienced while on the 5th floor of the hotel with her wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to be safe.
I was trapped in the wreckage of the collapsed wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
“I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
US Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Bullying’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily’s payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, something China denies.
The Trump-launched indictment of Beijing’s attempt to influence the US election marked what U.S. officials pointed to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign initiated by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish ads to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led them to raise tariff levels on imports by both sides.
China’s compensatory tariffs that were applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall on exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, which is one of the main exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, China is “further intensifying that pressure with announcements in our free press.”
“To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the precious American tradition of free speech and free press in an attempt to publish a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, only a few discrepant voices are seen and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that people in China may have about the troubling trajectory that their country’s economy is taking, as the media is controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant newspapers circumvented the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts say Republicans are moving away from women before mid-term vote with Kavanaugh’s debacle
As many well-known Republicans are closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there may be a setback, especially by women, in upcoming midterm votes.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have said they want to move forward with the vote.
“It’s not possible to turn back on these things,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s latest attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters displeased with the matter.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget it tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters gathering outside the Senate doors chanted "November is coming!" at the time the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Myc.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is out of the question,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among undecided women in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18-29, who don’t usually vote even if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts indicated that a setback could occur if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
"This matter has become a big mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's no longer just a matter of the committee vote or the final vote, not even if Kavanaugh is sitting on the bench; it's also about how the Republicans have handled all of this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA (a group that helps in the democrat election) told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they don’t know who they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, though there are a few more who side with the latter.
In a new YouGov poll, 41% of respondents say they believe Ford’s testimony definitively or likely, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh definitively or likely.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitively lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s statements, as well as at least those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Commission last week and said Kavanaugh raped her while drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the technology legend, a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world."
“It has to be now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique in the storage of personal online data is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills needed for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some of the developers included in the workforce who were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change is going to be introduced where all of their business models are completely modified overnight.
“We’re not going to ask for permission.”
In a post in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only cleric of the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received this award on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew he had been awarded the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, her two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was “of a special symbolism” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage", advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said the actions his grandfather carried out were "so great that I will never be able to reach his height, but they were very sobering."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, which featured the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evident when he is shown such a large amount of support."
MMA fans were awake all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so that in the end you won’t be allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose poster featured 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay awake until early in the morning just to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to cartoons as “a heavy joke.”
“There is a government regulation that regulates content that is broadcast from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to switch to child programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa la pordita, yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said he would modify the program to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
“When I think about the retransmission option, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn’t do it until Sunday at our own time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the schedule was changed, a lot of messages were received and not everyone was kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise you next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally did. We tried to offer more than usual so the fans were happy and we had a good time.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior for his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a winner.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn’t realize until he got to high school that “not everyone was like me.”
In Radio 4’s first Desert Island Discs show, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention when talking about gay rights was to convey “hope” to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him begin to underestimate the importance of winning the Olympics.
The regular host of this mythical show, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said, “To this day, that sense of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wasn’t disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to pass on that “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion said it was also a surprise to him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who has been around for 20 years, though she specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’ve lived so long since you were so young” (he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June who they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their “global perspective” had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all the answers would have been ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him I wasn’t going to be in the front row,” he said.
“I had his hand in my hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that precise moment that he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At that point I knew that was what I’d dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine at an Olympic Games, there was nothing better,” he said.
This was also what inspired him when choosing his first song, Proud of Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparatory phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to reverse his form if he wants to prevent it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years to set a record for the 12th time, was cleared by Captain Furyk for Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so many times done for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to settle for cheering in some moments and, in others, trying to perfect his game on the pitch and thus be able to rectify what ails him.
Never the most direct of the drivers, even at the highest point of his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best form for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough continually punishes with wrong blows.
And, if the field is no longer daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they’ve played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, kicked off in an impressive way, Mickelson’s game could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, nor could he say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role I had today, kicked me in the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record of most Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cups career that had never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
"I think the younger players have loved it as support, also this week; it was fun.
It’s a lot more than just a game.”
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that even if you enter with a substantial advantage in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an awkward tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish off the others by stepping on their heels by a minimum margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“Don’t stop remembering that we did a great tournament at Valderrama; we also did it at Brookline and we lost, we did it at Valderrama and we won, but for very little,” said Bjorn, portrayed, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead him with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
“History will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the dots are on the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that’s all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no more and no less, than the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players have done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I wouldn’t want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are the individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you’re there alone, you put all of your golfing ability to the test.
That’s the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it’s time to put your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as a couple, with the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends in the final days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team he won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe performed the "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
“We have 12 super-important matches tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and let them out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole tour," Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it won’t be done until at least next year due to faulty systems and progressive cost increases, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that heads the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, a military spokesman said.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery hampered the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and very low acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) to become obsolete when they start serving, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate took headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that left the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – half of the personnel on the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), rather than the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in light of the recent warnings about the reduction of Germany’s naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the navy is "running out of ships capable of deploying."
The officer said the problem has gotten worse over time, because the old ships were discharged, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spying on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been conducted in a state of the Scottish Highlands, attempts to discover how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
Everything that is found is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as Daubenton's shoreline bats and long-eared browns from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations on the property to track bat activities during the season.
The staff and NHS volunteers will also conduct mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to find out the frequency of calls from bats and what species do it.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticidal papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind,
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in the field, who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues.
The organisation has even inaugurated Scotland’s first and only bat reserve in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The property’s director, David Thompson, says it’s the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, as a breeding colony can be unintentionally destroyed and 400 females and offspring could be killed, which would mean annihilating an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo Denies Allegations of Rape While His Lawyers Are Chasing German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has categorized rape allegations as “fake news,” and says people “want to make themselves known” at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to denounce the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying him $375,000 to conceal the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already garnered 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, branded the report as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false,” says the five-time Ballon d’Or winner looking at the camera.
“They just want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as always.
They want to become famous by just mentioning me, but that's it, I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over allegations that appear in what they have called “an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will try to get compensation for "moral damage for an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents recorded at the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was at a "99 percent" a "good guy" and that he had disappointed him with that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consenting.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to come to an extrajudicial settlement because she had "terror to retaliation" and was concerned "to be humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman says she is trying to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the events.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has switched to Juve, an Italian football major for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: The UK would always regret losing automakers
The UK “would regret it all its life” if it lost its position as a world leader in auto manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK would tell the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production would be temporarily halted at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of delays on customs in the event of a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain breaks up with the EU at the end of March, there will be production shutdowns at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s general manager at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have shown their fears about leaving the EU without a deal, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns referred to by car manufacturers revolve around problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “just-in-time” production mode, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to make custom cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on 29 March, there could be a border disruption that, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to accommodate the amount of material equivalent to more than one day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in that case production would stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which establishes future relations with the EU, is “precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border crossings.”
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of step right now but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a tremendously successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would stop, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately cost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union manager at the plant, said its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover."
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and compelling plan that outlines our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “postpone another week” as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in Russian elections, links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation of whether or not Trump decides to fire the deputy attorney general and thus compromise Mueller’s independence has fueled Washington’s squabbles for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone he wore to try to relegate the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied that it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, among news reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was at the time at the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed another, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We’re going to decide on the march and I’m going to report to the press, as I usually do.”
Some journalists would refute that claim: Sanders has not held any press conferences at the White House since Sept. 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the motives were.
Sanders said the shortage of press wheels was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting grandiosely, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are blabbering."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
“The president conducts more question and answer sessions than any other president before him,” he said, quoting without evidence: “We’ve contrasted those numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking directly to the president of the United States, I think it's much better than doing them to me.
We tried to do it many times and you’ve seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why it was so, where he made an undisturbed and sometimes bizarre appearance before the journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of State for Health writes to NHS Scotland EU workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit have continued, in which the decisions expected this fall were chosen.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be very confusing for you.
And that is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to keep counting on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie was surgically intervened after suffering a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“He came to the band and he collapsed right there,” Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing him on a stretcher and leading him to have him examined in depth.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, sophomore redshirt, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 in the entire season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher property transfer tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher estate transfer tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised with this measure will be used to shelter the “homeless,” according to new plans from the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of the Corbyn offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in land transfer tax will be imposed on those people who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year for the homeless.
The additional money raised with the increase in the transfer tax from farms to foreign buyers of properties in the UK will go to aid for the "homeless," Theresa May announced today.
The move is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises of providing more affordable housing to attract younger and bullying voters to those with higher incomes.
The increase in land transfer tax will be levied on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to incentivize government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, could reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which causes higher prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the wealthiest areas of the country (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a transmission tax cut in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of maintaining very high prices on the properties by buying greedily unintentional land and urged Ms. May to eliminate the fees that apply to affordable housing to solve the "shameful housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive reforms for housing, including rental controls and an end to unreasonable evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more power to build new housing.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my role as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means resolving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become too hard for many people to achieve and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his “primary goal” is to become Scotland’s coach at some point.
The 42-year-old is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the Northeastern club, which currently holds the third place in League One (England’s third league division), three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking the St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B-hat," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it’s something that’s always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear when he switched to such established names in such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, success for me is measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can get the club back to where it should be."
Ross has only been coaching for three years, having been an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren move from being on the edge of the descent to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever before during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
“I always thought direction was the best thing I could do, much more than play.
It may sound weird, because it was good, I was able to make a good living with it and enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’ve managed to do it, it’s the time of my adult life where I’ve felt better, without a doubt.”

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwave has boosted profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but it has concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits fell by 4.8%, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s business consultancy, who collected the figures, commented: “The heat of these days and the fact that England remains at the World Cup have still kept the pattern in July from the previous month of June, in which pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, while restaurants have fallen even slightly more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant business in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered from the heat, though not as drastically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose up to 6.6% during the month, while meals fell 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM’s hospitality and leisure analysts, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since late April.
The timing and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the off-home activities market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year will be especially painful in view of the continued cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for gastronomic operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.

One in Five Kids Have Secret Social Media Accounts Behind Their Parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth in fake Instagram pages
News has heightened fears of sexual content being published
20% of students said they had a “main” account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced on fake Instagram accounts, a site of reference for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content will be published.
20% of students said they had a sanitized “main” account that they showed their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who happened to meet her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site saw a teenager encourage others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teens are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the directive of the athletics federation of Scotland
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track and field athlete and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim the sport benefits from its vast international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from having her on board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I like being the spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or to what extent I would.
It’s been exhausting, but I managed to fully recover, I had to learn to walk again and I’m currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The advertisement of the shoelaces where mothers are compared to cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A loafer company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what is in theory the "world's first silent milkshake", consumer technology company Elvie posted an advertisement inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music showing mothers telling them the freedom that the new milk extractor gives them.
Four royal women dance in a barn filled with hay like a dance floor, along with cows, with letters like, "Yes, I milk myself alone, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not ubres, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Order them, milk them, I'm feeding their babies, milking them, milking my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created a big controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all sorts of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before they give birth in order to produce milk, except that they are taken away from their babies days after they give birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor fits discreetly in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?”
Another comment was, "Wow, a more vague advertisement."
However, other people defended the announcement, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "stunning."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd probably have one.
By using the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but I don't give it any more twists.
It’s a product genius,” a woman told us.
Another person commented: "It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is totally silent, has no cables or tubes, and discreetly engages inside the breastfeeding bra, allowing its users to move around, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, comments: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has appeared in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded down the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of minor immigrants discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant minors has experienced a considerable increase, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has practically remained at the usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration government entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“About 80% of sponsors or their families are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
In their effort to prosecute minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum period of one month from the arrest, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to workers in the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by video conferencing, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who do not consider themselves fit for protection will be deported as soon as possible.
According to host workers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
According to the advocates, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where, due to its size, signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked.
In addition, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on “occupation forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country’s war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is practically over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would “continue to fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said they were given the right conditions for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for sowing "irrational fears" that made the refugees decide to stay out of the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone at Idlib’s last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the deal had “clear deadlines” and has expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters (linked to Al-Qaeda), who “will be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new government-opposition committee soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted "to review articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators are sure to expect, an impeachment or scandal prematurely end his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak audience hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed cable channel indices with 3.5 million viewers for major night news programs.
“It’s a strange attraction we haven’t yet been able to understand,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of Designated Survivor, an ABC drama about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride he made in Boston before the 2016 election?
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," was Scovell's reply.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families can get together, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information goes beyond limits when you realize that you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” the $15,000 ostrich leather hunter by Paul Manafort (“Washington’s over-the-top pride dress”).
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s in part what makes everything look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he talks to us about the alternating cast of Trump’s show and his daily twists on the plot (either getting into an NFL fight or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to be left behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was a refugee inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get off the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Commission and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
“I remember when in those days we were doing all those crazy programs and people were telling us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss tells me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows in the narrowest midterm elections of the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise the influx of money is reaching Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This Pittsburg residential district, whose structure has recently been redesigned, has Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a funding dispute for campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, although after it backed down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received around $140 million in aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that their intention was for the conference to continue, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence plans to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, to the diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to treat the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next planned step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstruction of Trump’s justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also investigating the possibility that the Trump campaign will work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to re-present himself to voters, and perhaps eventually to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionalities, and with that I do not suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the dispute.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler; all the West had to do was resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good mood since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will encounter a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I don’t think we will fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my house as ambassador.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles at the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the meeting against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“We managed to get a good point, because Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game believing we could get something and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, the tie was maybe a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out for everyone and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope that we can achieve all three points, but it will be a difficult match because they have already achieved a good result in the previous match, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now you notice a general atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team is doing well, the guys are enjoying a lot and we are having a good training.
I hope that we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.”
Fear of Retirement Savings Is Losing Some Women’s Sleep
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talk about this with their relatives.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about this issue.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you won’t be able to prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to get care, as those options can be a determining factor in the cost.
Incorporate your financial advisor into the conversion, as it can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Adhere to legal battles.
Make sure you get a health care power to appoint a trusted person to supervise your health care and make sure professionals fulfill their own wishes in case you can’t communicate.
You can also prepare a notarial power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always on track.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors do you have to deal with?” asks Martin.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned.”
Shot several times at a man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They shot a man several times with a rifle while he was walking home after going out at night.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. (British time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and the police have appealed to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said.
With communications blocked, aid officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically inferior administrative region to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Belt of Fire, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffers earthquakes.
Below we summarize some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coastline, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it recalls the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The quake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, a 29-year-old citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report released Saturday by Alaska state police.
According to the police report, when a friend of hers tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin has been issued a pretrial detention facility at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held with an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "definitely innocent" when asked for his statement, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A minor offenses, meaning he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of interfering in the denunciation of a crime of domestic violence and of possessing a weapon in a state of drunkenness, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed to have punched him in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental van to carry out last October an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, shooting down pedestrians and cyclists he found in his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and caused “intentionally” serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to apply for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges involve a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 counts that included eight counts of organized crime murder, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a New York federal case was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed his lack of remorse during the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be hoisted in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the indictment of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilt with a life sentence with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to “feel the heat” of eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should take over negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would "already have left" if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Prime Minister May faces to reconcile her divided ranks has been highlighted even more when a group of Tories in favor of permanence have joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep up with the compromise plan that was signed in Chequers amid the attacks of Brexit pros, their opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and "chaos."
Deputy Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a responsible position in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have already left,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I’m going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
In his declaration of opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the European Union is completely false.”
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the concentration, where she told reporters: "I'm just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like Chequers’ plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular among our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually take to the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers keep their office when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the concentrates that politicians would have to “feel the heat” if they were to be seen to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we’re not going to let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are going to mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, pro-stayers roamed the streets of Birmingham ahead of the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved banners of Tories Against Brexit after the group’s presentation this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party application during the opening of the conference.
“These are the same people who tell us they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Considers Opportunity to Run for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider every possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he intended to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.”
One arrested for the murder of the LSU Sims player with a firearm
Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, has been arrested last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde went to defend a friend and got shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, possessing a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a player originally from Baton Rouge who is 1.98 meters tall, played in 32 games last season, being the starter in 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter boxing and let Hamilton run in the group’s queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes forcefully left a lap later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton got ahead after an action with the wheels almost stuck that made the Ferrari driver have to leave the interior unwillingly free at the risk of resisting after a double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and placed seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race while clinging to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered boxing on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by reclaiming Raikkonen's fourth position.
It’s been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman by letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That's been a really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, disgusting and false.”
“The only thing that could happen and the good that’s happening these last days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and fake,” he said.
“When you read the posts and leaks, and then they say, ‘But if I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't filtered it," he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak coming from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t filter out her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.”
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented: “I’ll tell you one thing: that’s been a really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return game Saturday 5-3 at Dundee.
The Giants scored an initial two-goal lead thanks to attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie won the local tie before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assistance for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan put the local team back in eager play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to equalize the match in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first game.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the match with a knockout in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and secured victory with their team's fifth goal approaching the end.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so hundreds of people can escape on the plane from the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to batter the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport control tower in Palu, which was being hit by a strong sway.
He stood firm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand people.The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, since there were still many bodies under the ruins and it has not been possible to contact many people," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance with more bodies arrives every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible to the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini Now Says One Man Has Disappeared After Air Crash In A Lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has gone missing after it said the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that a male passenger could not be seen since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overtaken the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
“That’s an extremely good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water reaching their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors carrying out near dock improvement work also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Aviation safety network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended the presentation of its arguments on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury the way he used mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford took to the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been to the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford van that night, Sanford said he was "lieing, because my van was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they had only met a week earlier.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be in the hands of the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Performers like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York babysitter sues couple for firing after 'racist' text
A New York babysitter is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from the mother complaining she was “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to a case of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her dismay at discovering that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK PERSON," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her shyness, an “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice claiming that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and was expecting a Filipina instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for the one-day job and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving a compensation of $350 per day for the six-month internal work position for which he had been hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show you that things don’t get done that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they are racist by saying the termination of Maurice’s employment was the most reasonable, as they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife had sent him something I didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the lawsuit as an “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that she was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to go for someone like that?
That’s not that it’s a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors fear readers won’t identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It was hard to put yourself in the place of someone who read it for the first time before its publication.
It’s very nice to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before drawing inspiration from a toy bear to write the children's book, was confident that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was somewhat "bitter" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t like to brag,” he said.
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he was not expected to achieve it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got Nad’s call to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to maintain the pumping of her heart were slowly depleted and left her system.
She had died early and everything was turning off.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay strong.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, alien to the terrible experience that was going on.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I hung my head and tears fell on me all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up anywhere.”
However, he left the job before he died, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards “so people know there are people you can go to and talk to, even if he’s a friend.
Don’t feel silent, you have to talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been dating for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was feeling depressed or anything,” he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he didn’t even look at them.”
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: "Leave a void in the whole family.
He's left us shattered.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a time-limited, limited-range investigation), maybe we could bring some unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going to a standstill” amid a partisan paralysis.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
Its denial is entirely due to the chronology.
If, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to achieve the election of the man they want for the country's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defector numbers "fall" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and high tariffs charged by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on this.
The vast majority of deserters in the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and they are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who broadly agreed to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will by no means be the first to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "hysterical" and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said it was a hysterical one," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
At the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated defamations" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed his bias against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll just say one thing: if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won’t be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, you won’t even be in the court where you’re exercising now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible verdicts against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to feel that everything is fine," Pelosi said.
And women have to handle it.
It’s a justified diatribe, it’s months and years of rage overflowing, and she can’t let go of it without crying.
“We cried when we got angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's that weird, do I?"
She went on to say, “I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive at some company and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique that when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
No, I'm angry."
And then he went on with what he was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for rabies in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the cogote and dragged me to a staircase.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” he said.
“They have no idea you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they think they’ve cornered you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in her presidential career.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which he had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with no reason not to explore the idea of herself running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-intentioned decision,” he said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was already well advanced, it lagged behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not re-enter the race unless it raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, only gave her $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she gave her speech to announce that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (thank you for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on raising voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism), that she hugged herself.
"The logical thing would have been to think that he had had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said, recalling the reaction from the press.
“You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you gonna put on my gravestone?
“Crying?”

The first salvos from the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while there is still a long way to go before the battle ends, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in products, charging tax on half of products entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent retaliation, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on U.S. products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match U.S. attacks, and the world’s second-most powerful economy is unlikely to loosen anytime soon.
Achieving Washington to back down would mean yielding to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a slump in the economy in either country is actually far more dangerous than viewers have acknowledged so far,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on Asian issues for the Center for New American Security’s strategic cabinet.
Syria ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has already been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions were improving.
“The situation on the ground today is more stable and safe thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are already in place.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the North American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water in hole 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell 5 and 4 to the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world’s number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most tournament victories of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a very hard year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have been able to get the cup back.
It is an achievement of the whole team and I am very happy to have been able to help," said an excited Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a after the victory of the European team.
Now the torch goes to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 on Sunday in a singles game.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods as I grew up watching this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, leaving only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight throughout the weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance of his team: "I'm so proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we've lost him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have made a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it is up to us to bow our heads.
They've outdone us."
