Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about "making the figure of the clowns"
Some Members of the Assembly are appalled at the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal arose as a result of the programmes to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly throughout the political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party's Assembly said his party is concerned that "it can rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means asshole and pwp means crap.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed to be "open" to the name change, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the English pronunciation of the Yorkshire of the letter U.
The Assembly committee, which is currently in the process of drafting the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of how the members of the Assembly will be called will obviously be a topic of debate for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed broad support for the possibility of calling the Welsh Parliament Assembly.
As regards the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Member of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option received greater consent in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties of reaching consensus could prove to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for the referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for the name change, said he would not consider the result of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are ringing while the churches of Harlem are in trouble
“The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"There's no one here today."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people frequent on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the estates will not last as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who won’t help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he says, “and for that reason they will rush the moment when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that much of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by confraternities before Harlem became a black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against retailers on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners were planning its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been staged in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the church's lay leaders, others from the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese was "trying to pay the costs" on the parish assembly although the latter had not been involved in the assumption of archetypes.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old in California Lobster Diving
Official sources say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving in search of lobsters in California, during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream and swam up to him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to catching a lobster but then "he realized that the boy was screaming 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His entire collarbone was torn," he said of noticing Hammel once he reached the boy.
“I called out to everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Beach watchman Captain Larry Giles said in a news release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been declared not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans a push towards the beauty products sector in the UK
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with lanes dedicated to the department store's beauty products assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn push to the UK beauty products market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household goods sectors decline, the largest lanes dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and adopted in more stores next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are on the hunt for new ways to use the space on the shelves once dedicated to televisions, microwaves and homewares.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its beauty range to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most products are vegan - a quality increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will experiment with authorizations in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, and a second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift toward buying small amounts of food daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to engage more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain seeks to resist discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since it bought the two chains about two years ago, and such a strategy has given impetus to food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to restore enamel to its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenues from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury brands of skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve transformed the look of our beauty departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and convenient locations make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby parades from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her trending brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of housewives and accessories Truly.
The couple's business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, turned to Instagram to announce her resignation.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious after she retired from their lucrative last-minute trending branding business to focus on her new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was "angry" when the golden TV girl admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her trading empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - did not give her enough time to dedicate herself to their brand of houseware and accessories Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was calculated to double Willoughby’s assets, estimated at around <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his abandonment of Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his holiday residences.
A source said: “Truly was without a doubt Holly’s top priority.
It had to be her long-term future that would engage her for the next twenty years.
His decision to leave has left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe the abandonment of This Morning’s host, one of the UK’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions due to strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in launching the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby conceived Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couple spent the holidays together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a guest on ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" show.
A source close to Jones said last night that he "doesn't want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media to make a comment that some would consider "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the “newscaster.”
"I didn't give up anything."
He stressed that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward in North Korea’s denuclearization.
But negotiations for denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the UN General Assembly held on Saturday, that North Korea did not observe an "equivalent response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
“With North Korea, we are achieving excellent results,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last U.S. military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s simple to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded camp, we would have about 200 people right here in front of us,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastates island, killing hundreds
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations had been informed that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, an essential requirement to activate international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it’s not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common structure on other coasts.
The apparent lack of an alarm siren for the tsunami in Palu, although the alarm had been given, likely contributed to the loss of human lives.
Under the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading for Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of Indonesia’s infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds hit Joko’s administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko must also cope with pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes due to clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equalises against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a point in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 yards from Chelsea's door, with his team down 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second pole.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it turned to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga by bagging into the net.
"It was just trying to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I gave a touch and I didn't think about it too much and I pulled."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after the 25th minute goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The centre-back of the Blue crossed his heels to Mateo Kovacic before kicking off close to midfield and shooting in the midfield of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick pass to the midfield.
Then he performed a beautiful passage that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard overtook the defense and finished on the second pole with a left-handed goal over Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the agency in charge of disaster management said on Sunday morning.
Numerous people have been reported trapped in the rubble of the collapsed buildings following the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and generated waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been littered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning but I would like to appeal to anyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious and invites them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location of the find this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police said they are currently informing the victim's family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but has been told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would take hours before they were allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the delimited area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the delimited area checking the apartment building.
Anyone with information about this is welcome to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 with registration number 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "rewriting history"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick’s proposal a “crazy” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in light of the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
Iconoclastia during the English Civil Wars was not ordered or conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, an advocate of parliament from outside pressures, in his case of the monarchy of course.
Whether this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure who represents a part of such a fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pig at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby piglet was open.
He claimed that in the pig there was a big male pig with blood on his nose.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250-kg pig had crushed the farmer, according to statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and bruised," said the cousin identified with the surname "Wu", as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people, while police collect evidence on the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer's death.
Although they are rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst.”
“They just want to play.
They are playful, very curious .... they do not want to hurt.
Just show them the right amount of respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. coast in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5 ET on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a squall is forming over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, she will begin to push a strong tropical humidity northward, in the southwestern part of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during Monday’s day.
Thus, the tropical humidity in contact with the approaching sludge will create heavy and vast rainfall in the southwestern area in the coming days.
At the local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates to reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm of rain is expected in some areas of the southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions may occur due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rains could make the canyons of rivers full and the storms will bring wind to swells and lift dust.
The approaching landslide will cause heavy rains locally on part of the southern California coast.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the region’s first precipitation in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more widespread in late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will descend on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be strong temperature fluctuations on the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature variations over short distances.
An exceptional example of sensitive temperature differences in the central U.S. will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the residual heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm start to October is expected for much of the central and eastern U.S., with 26oC from the Southern Plains to the northeast.
In New York it will reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is a temperature of about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate strong odds of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks on Thursday the compelling deposition by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute turn on Friday: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was intoxicated and tried to undress her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposition, said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to the other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty counting the spectators who follow the programs in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, this is a similar audience to that for a football playoff game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS operators Friday morning as he was insulted by protesters as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He remained low-eyed for several minutes as he was reprimanded and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have power while many women are powerless.”
Flake stated that his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the commission hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh's appointment to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the charges against the candidate over the next week, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'doing politics' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of letting the European Union "make politics" with Britain's future and jeopardize the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside that with the prime minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Brexit deal, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU must collect their respective tariffs is “absolutely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest LSU Player Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges, Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson’s DNA on them, reports CBS-affiliated WAFB television station.
After interrogating Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
The East Baton Rouge Forensic Office issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task force for Louisiana State Police fugitives, the police science lab, Southern University police, and local citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the zone law enforcement for their commitment and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198-cm striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was “disturbed” and “under shock” by Wayde’s death.
“This is what you worry about at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano sprinkles with ash Mexico City
The ash coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity had increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring the various rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City’s Xochimilco neighborhood.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity near the volcano that is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police riot teams and thousands of people joined opposition demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists hampered by riot police targeted police officers with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
There were further clashes during the day with policemen who resorted to manganese to contain the fight.
For several hours, groups of independentists chanting “We won’t forget, we won’t forgive” clashed with unionist demonstrators shouting “Long live Spain.”
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive care for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
Tensions remain high in the independent region a year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although attendance had been low, and Catalans opposed to secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the referendum that was taking place at seats across the region with violent clashes.
The independent groups had camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia to become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite winning a key victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalan independent parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement’s best-known leaders finding themselves in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of indecision.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest with his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both factions.
“The situation is increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after hoarding a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly hit a Londonderry home in a car.
The accident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a crossbow at some point.
Menga's attack signifies Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston signed the win
The already promoted Livingston left the Rangers stunned by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference while Gary Holt's team moved to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team is therefore without a home away victory in the Premiership this season and will have to face the first in the Hearts standings next Sunday, from which they are separated by 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues his series of division wins remaining unbeaten for six games, with coach Holt still having to see a defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is wasting opportunity against low-incisive guests
Holt's team should have been ahead well before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after stepping in to meet Craig Halkett's headshot on the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could put visitors in trouble with kicks placed.
And this is how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a penalty kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, who could score from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This pattern was maintained during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston playing pattern.
The crosses succeeded in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two demands for rigour, after Halkett's confrontation with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for hand-fuck, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and collaborators have changed very little since their return to the top series, but we have to give a lot of credit to Holt for the way he has been able to spur the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a masterfully organized defense, while Menga challenged Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were little inspired.
Despite the excellent performance in some moments with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below those standards.
It missed the last pass - only once they managed to penetrate the opponent's area - and it can be considered an alarm bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan received with contrasting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies Saturday (September 29th) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at easing relations between NATO allies.
They clashed on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest group of the Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police have reasoned with security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have voiced their voices, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent provoked by a visitor considered a hero by some German Turks and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford street, in the southeastern area of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened months after another cyclist died, infested by a street pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said authorities were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Wounded During Disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a disorder at the maximum-security male prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at the men's maximum security prison in Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized agents "Tornado" have been employed to handle the riot, which involves eight inmates and which is confined to a wing of the prison.
The agents were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to contain an incident currently underway at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer prison term."
Long Lartin Prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment following the attack on a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-coup agents were called in to intervene in the prison to sedate a violent riot during which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa will cross the desert’s southwest, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be positive as the southwestern area is currently going through a period of drought.
“According to the Center for Drought Monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category.”
Initially, Hurricane Rosa's path will reach land through Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, who still maintained hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the coldest waters in the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected to arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening on Monday.
Precipitation in parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
“Precipitation is expected between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the northwestern area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm,” reported weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with tropical depression, then heading through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or her tows is intense rainfall in Baja California, in the northwestern area of Sonora and in the southwestern desert area of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Such rains are expected to generate sudden, potentially deadly flooding and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Authorities have appealed to anyone who may have picked up what happened with the phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered from the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered from the evil and anger” of the Democratic Party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, passionately and resolutely denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations of sexual violence against her decades ago, when she was still a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing defending himself from the charge.
The president said Saturday that "the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote to uphold Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to uphold one of the most experienced law minds of our time, a lawyer with an unparalleled record in public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment by talking about the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
“Five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m really going to do it,” he said.
"For this lot strenuously for exceptional candidates."
Trump said Democrats are committed to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first fundamental procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many swept away by giant waves that crashed onto beaches, when a large-scale earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when waves as high as 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach at dusk, sweeping away numerous people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their beach activities and did not run away immediately, thus turning into victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster control agency BNPB, told Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit anything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, contorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The landslide continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was perceived in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's strong earthquake was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have boosted the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living in the area," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the areas involved.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had struck Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time the alarm was sounded.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man on the top floor of a building shouting agitated way to alert people to the tsunami coming down the road.
A few minutes after a water wall collapsed on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami triggered a massive blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue interventions.
According to authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other essential goods.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for rescue and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's terrible.
Although Donggala’s World Vision staff managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where employees took refuge under tarpaulin shelters in the backyard of their office, they encountered scenes of devastation along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even as rescue teams began the difficult start-up operations of rescue gears, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign rescue workers with extensive knowledge have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
Indonesian legislation stipulates that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start arriving if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And this has not yet happened.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international assistance, but status has not yet been defined.”
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that relieve the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained for the Asian Games that concluded this month in Indonesia two of the missing paragliding drivers.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran in the paragliding industry, I’m carrying my emotional load,” he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single gray tick rather than two blue ticks.
“I think it means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM in the entertainment center and was preparing to hand over more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “came up behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag with the money destined for delivery.
Witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information regarding the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
In announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The person formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We've gone from Kanye, which means the one, to simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our badness, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are.”
It is just one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed the name with or without dashes and capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the military against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking hold throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in the artificial intelligence sector, the U.S. should double research funding in this field, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of several U.S. government groups regarding AI, although a formal AI strategy is generally lacking in the U.S.
Meanwhile, China presented its program last year: it aspires to be the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget in AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the US and we need a new revolution in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big success in the AI industry will be achieved in the US, Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the American Otello player with the highest score and subsequently served as executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be held, in order to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders, it’s multinationals,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired luminaires from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhD students in AI,” he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its program for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. order to create a National Commission for Security on Artificial Intelligence has not been active for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on the possible change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its membership requests to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims its neighbours' name constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about the possibility that the turnout will reach the minimum 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with NATO and EU membership and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to pay for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will respect the result of the vote to make it final.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in favour.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, attendance was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters had cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of the curtains mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get in high, not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia, indicated that 57% of respondents expected to go to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scores a goal avoiding the entire defence of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of the defence of Brighton during the 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it extremely easy to score his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the action.
He moved between three defenders of Brighton before catapulting to the open field.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated one defender before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
He then made a turn to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right shot in the net.
"Aguero is having problems with his foot," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at the time.”
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep on the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling towards the second pole.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net shortly before leaving the field.
The City will fight Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But the as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who maintain an advantage over a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least one rematch with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still hoping to get their title in the first division.
“Even if we play without a goal, at least we can be able to pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
“Why should I never want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a first pitcher for Sunday, but are said to be inclined to let Scherzer pitch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first pitcher for the 34th time, performed a pitching session on Thursday and would be the first pitcher on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings for this season.
Trump to meet in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the turnout of Republicans in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is put at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really doing my best for this, and I'm fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, “We see this horrible group of radical democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you can see the badness, the pettyness.
They don’t care who they can hit, who they have to overwhelm in order to regain power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control, and we won’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of “resisting and obstructing.”
“And it’s been possible to see it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, mean, mean and liars.”
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, sparking loud whistles among the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, um, no, look a--that was a bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Do not tolerate people who say what they think
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, it wasn’t a big surprise.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who have been told not to be welcome, and all because they said what they thought.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has been treated like this because he strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all topics similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the local Labour Party parliament, Friday evening meetings were just like that.
However, today this is not the tone of numerous meetings and the promise of a "kinder and more courteous" policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable to party leadership.
This all started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I would share a similar political vision began to expect a reversal of the trend on my part and that I would take positions that I would never accept, whether it was national security or the European single market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there are insults on social media calling for my withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policy and telling me that I shouldn’t be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues because comments to me tend to be political in nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalisation of insult levels.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of mistrust or modification of the selection rules, the party shrinks.
In the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would be fine".
But that’s not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thatcher government’s carelessness that had let my high school class literally fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as a local councilor or government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way disconcerted by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm households, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of what I believe to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeaten Ayr scale ranking
Two late attempts may have somehow outbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this exceptionally fun Tennent championship day game.
I'm now at the top of the table, the only team out of ten that's unbeaten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been put to the test in our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “We have to recognize Ayr’s merit, they have better taken advantage of our opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigor before, just in half time, to score and then convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 at the interval.
But the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson’s goal, converted from Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was stretched, and upon reboot, the Ayr jumped back into the lead thanks to a goal from Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's replacement captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose charged the man with an unconverted goal from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a contrast with Ballless Climate, with a touch of rigor, MacPherson scored a touch down behind the Ayr's advancing mix.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost since the restart, after Rowe had picked up the football from the David Armstrong area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to look for the fifth goal of the home team.
Still Game star looks for a new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran decided to move to the hotel industry after discovering he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays with longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth series will also be the show’s finale and it looks like Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to make statements, though a Scottish Sun source said Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous catering business."
''The sea is ours'': Bolivia with no outlet on the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters lined with sarcasm in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
“Recovering it is a duty.”
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coastline and now in Chile’s hands after a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive, as is the desire to once again traverse the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have perhaps reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude,” explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia's claim that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an outlet on the sea of competence.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year - has a lot to do with Monday's ruling.
“We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The U.N. body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final rulings indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morale’s belligerent rhetoric has thwarted any good intentions left of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions following what happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly speedy.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able to “enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile” and will have the opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as political excavation.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Judgement is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen without U.S. confidence
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never disarm from nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington first.
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be intent on restarting stalled diplomatic talks after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an “illusion” that the continuation of sanctions and US opposition to a declaration to end the Korean War could ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to issue the statement without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang intends to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows present the latest trend in huge headgear that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your collection of headgear or completely block the rays of the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a series of crazy oversized headwear on the catwalks for their 2019 spring-summer collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have raged on Instagram this summer and these stylists have sent their eye-catching creations onto the catwalk.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated hat of beige color decorated with a wide feather-like edge that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversize accessories included jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer’s hat, and even a pineapple – but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks feature sewn lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a diving kit with mask and eyeglasses, while the other looked like a loose ice cone.
And if you continue with the huge style statements, you are in luck.
The style observers predict that the huge caps could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
Outsize hats arrive in the wake of "The Bomb", the straw hat with a span of more than a meter that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that invaded social media sent another huge creation into the catwalk: a beach bag in straw almost as big as the model in costume who wears it.
The branded orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera Spring-Summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I anticipate these great hats and beach bags will arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the stylist has gotten such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this was continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aspire to prepare students for subsequent higher education, chosen careers, and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of developing and adopting a personalized curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and in demand subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach the heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build trusting relationships with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we can observe that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages got the highest marks.
The data, collected from the 74 member schools of the SCIS, showed that 72% of students got the highest rating with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish got the highest rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the curricula of independent institutes and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons employees indicated for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an actual advantage in the future with a lifelong proficiency like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK by looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, with the teaching staff specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever their future.
It cannot be denied right now, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-championship opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be determined for how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After training early in the week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game pre-season program.
“At this point in my career I don’t need friendly matches to prepare me,” he said.
The Time of Trump’s West Virginia Gathering, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a rally.
This is the first meeting of the five scheduled for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time will Trump’s commission be and how can you follow him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia online through the live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings this week, which have become tense due to allegations of sexual violence with an early Senate confirmation vote pending for a week as the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help Republicans facing the November elections gain some momentum.
So, President Trump’s campaign said that these five meetings over the next week are aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so crucial to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busiest season of the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled for Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally could draw back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh media coverage," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in the lead in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows courage to fight to keep hopes alive until Sunday singles
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum bike is a totally invented sports concept in which players believe firmly and never like in races like these.
Where would the bike be now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I'd say we're keeping a bit of a bike," Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, four points ahead with 12 more at stake.
Americans feel they have a bit of wind in their favor, as Spieth has said, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth has been ruthless from tee to green and is setting the example.
The guttural cries of celebration became stronger as the game went on, sinking a crucial putt to equalize the scores in game four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt that made them win the 15-hole game was greeted with a similar shout, which tells you that he believes the American team is not out of the race yet.
“You really have to worry about your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all any of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with the most Spieth and Thomas points in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable version of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but adorable couple is four out of four and can’t do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to shoot a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the noisy crowd, cements the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European glory speeches are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon made it to Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four-ball, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes drowned the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not even get far.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and don’t give, and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a major advantage in the final day but this foursome session has shown that the USA team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup after concluding Saturday’s fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score so far to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, in an attempt to keep the trophy lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning fourballs, winning 3-1.
The U.S. resisted the most in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to recover the draw.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a knocked out Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even cleaner 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself for two games on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned alongside partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – world number one and three.
Europe, however, did not achieve all the results it had hoped for on a pleasant and windy day south-west of Paris.
Three-time big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a grim 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team returned from a four-point gap to the individual, although as the owner, Furyk's team only needs a draw to defend the trophy.
After being second best for two days, however, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea absolutely refuses to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that maintaining sanctions was exacerbating the country’s mistrust in the United States, which in such circumstances would have absolutely refused to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Health Organization’s General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any consistent response from the US," he said.
“Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no security in our national security, and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm unilaterally first.”
Although Ri re-used the remarks about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization with which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual action, his statement was important because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as already done by Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first ever meeting between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on the need to “have denuclearization first” and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive way, and even opposes the “declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion of those who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our mistrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced to the UN earlier this week.
The minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the counterpart to this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be dead at this point.”
But even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year’s at the UN General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to target U.S. territory with North Korea’s missiles after “the president of evil” Trump called Kim a “missile man” engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking the path of disarmament, but said much still needs to be done and that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a deadline, stating that “whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "Compliance with Security Council sanctions must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and verifiable denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously backed sanctions control of North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea already three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of filing “gangster requests.”
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US took "compliant measures."
He said Kim had explained to him that the “compliant measures” he wanted were security guarantees Trump had pledged in Singapore and actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all of its students to sleep more in an attempt to counter the growing masculine culture of studying for whole nights powered by caffeine.
One university scholar has found that world’s number one university students often have no idea of the basic concepts of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He had the idea to start the course after a lecture he had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I being told this only now, when I’m in my last year?’
She said that no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me a lot," she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is the image of a dormitory room, where students can select cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to be able to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the “blank night to study” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to lack of sleep being a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue, anxiety, explained and should even serve to avoid getting fat since lack of sleep brings the brain into inedible mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the faculty of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar study program before enrolling at this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another out-of-home depression attack with Dolly Menga’s goal that relegated Steven Gerrard’s disjointed team to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking for the first out-of-home win since the February 4–1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 coaching games leaving his team eight points away from the Ladbrokes Premiership's running leaders, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired Rangers formation never seemed able to match.
While the Ranger now descends to sixth place, the Livingston rises to third, and only behind the Hibernian for goal difference.
And there could be further problems coming up for the Rangers after line-up Calum Spence was cured of a head injury due to an object apparently thrown from the outside.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly surpassed the Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual formation that tore a point at the Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated their opponents every lap.
The Rangers may have dominated for possession of the ball but Livingston took better advantage of the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's filter pass in the first half sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's door but the midfielder wasted the opportunity.
A deep penalty kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense comrade Alan Lithgow could only pull sideways on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their play in the area of rigor.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to see a rigor assigned to the 15th after a fight with Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the demands of the Colombian.
The Rangers managed to shoot only twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't let Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and a soft shot from Ovie Ejaria worry.
Although Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even just for his commitment.
Again, the Rangers failed to manage a football placed deep in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher leaked the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean finish.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the shift had an almost immediate impact as the wing pitched a ball to Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself off the door line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased detachment in the final stages, but McGregor opposed to stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton filed a final request for rigor after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the counting continues... the day the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those unreliable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say a little, it's just bursting right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many types of cancer and are then re-injected
An experimental trial of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and then those cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar procedure of extracting immune cells from patients to “teach” them how to hit cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself into a pro-Trump diatribe wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was whistled in the studio during a Saturday Night Live episode after an offbeat performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA cap, he began a fury against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so many times and they say, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist!'"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Commission against allegations of sexual violence brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of the Philippine West was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had a bad time in the backstage because of his headgear.
“I was bullied in the backstage.
I was told ‘don’t go out with that cap on.’
They bullied me!
And so they told me I’m an outcast,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said, "I would wear the Superman cloak because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to go on?
“Try the love.”
His comments spawned whistles at least twice from the public and SNL cast members seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with one person telling the magazine: "A deadly silence has fallen on the study."
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many with a performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR HEADING TO THE MASS."
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “what it is and this is just wonderful.”
“But I have chosen NOT to reward someone (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe is embracing a puzzling ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now “the person previously known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper's friend, Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion and of course the missing music legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Allegation of attempted murder for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast East on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is due to appear at the Presidium of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Office.
Sword Throne Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Sword Throne.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that such on-screen soils often make boys believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed “something went wrong” and reflected on how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-star of Swords Throne, 31, admitted to worrying a lot about this problem.
"Personally, I'm very concerned, very much at the time - what was our mistake with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we are observing now?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued, ‘What is born and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes boys think they have to be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time – how can we change things?
“Something has gone wrong for young people.”
During the interview he also admitted that he will not play any prequel or sequel to Sword's Throne once the series ends next summer, stating that he "has finished with battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s True West revival, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with Sword Throne.
“I met my wife during this series, so she gave me my future family, and my life from now on,” he explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow, the character of Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities sources.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported already in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, according to Chinese health authorities during a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country’s traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from GOP senators, and speaks of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
The U.S. MP on Saturday denounced charges against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Democratic MP from Los Angeles said the statements were spurred by opinionists and ultra-right-wing websites.
"Lies, lies and still disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published would include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online Thursday, released by an anonymous Capitol official during a hearing of a panel of experts on allegations of sexual violence against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released information relating to a Waters staff member.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were jeopardized as a result of these false and biased allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of that information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ claim quickly generated online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t get angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You don't have to question the accuser's reasons.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to oust Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Enormous if confirmed," he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters said its office had alerted "competent authorities and law enforcement of these tendentious claims.
“We will ensure that those responsible are exposed and that they are held accountable for all of their dangerous and harmful actions to all of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English strikes again - spy parody with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become customary to search for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems applicable to this revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 and came to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Renaissance.
The veiled self-irony on the subject of how ugly we do will be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and eyes out of orbit got his license to mess things up for the second time – and his name indicates more than anything that this is a comic creation developed for non-English-speaking moviegoers.
Of course he is the silly secret agent who despite his strange glamour claims has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind that contributed with a single note to the Glory moments theme of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is a character based initially on the traveler and mysterious international man who once played Atkinson in the now-forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, who left the chaos behind him.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers bolt briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems rather undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed to children rather than adults and to me the crazy misadventures of Johnny English are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson’s silent films when playing Mr. Bean.
The immutable current premise now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent in charge, a very small role unfortunately for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that fills the vase for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this similar-Teresa May character but there’s not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this means that the sinister Johnny English, who now works as a school manager in a chic facility, but who also gives informal lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some cute gags, when English offers a school-of-rock espionage course.
English is beaten back in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Then the Batman and Robin disasters for His Majesty's secret services are back in action, to meet the beautiful femme fatale of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously into the network of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by sneaking into Volta’s luxury yacht and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to get acquainted with Volta’s interior.
All of the scenes are certainly designed for the final sequence, but as handsome and exuberant as it is, there’s a lot of children’s TV in the whole story.
The whole thing is pretty modest.
And as happened with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: couldn’t the British film industry assign Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies it is drafting a plan for the British to work four days a week but be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, even though they are paid for five.
The party would like major companies to transfer the savings made by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Revolution to workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend while maintaining the same pay.
Some sources said the idea would be compatible with the party's economic program and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day day was endorsed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour party told The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, a revision of the policy line is expected to be announced."
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not part of the party’s political line and is not currently under discussion.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless leaders” and “speculators” in utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also imply that current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire shareholding package, since the Labour government could implement “deductions” based on behavior deemed illegal.
It also confirmed plans to include employees on corporate boards and create inclusive equity funds, so as to transfer 10 percent of the net worth of private sector businesses to employees, who end up pocketing annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises doubts as to whether or not the government agency’s findings could influence any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to bring out something that could induce them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said it while I was going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, that that accusation came out, I said, ‘Did you do it?’
It was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s vows, however, seem to be carved into the rock.
“I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could withstand a bomb-proof charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vigorously denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you named couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that sees the performance of a notable cast of stars and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
Arriving at the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pouring into the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real purpose of the event, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But exactly, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that there are 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way of persuading people to call for action, or is it just another example of so-called “clickivism” – people who really feel like making a difference simply by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “shares” of its supporters, working for a variety of purposes.
These actions have helped urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, designed to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their shares, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that so far hedge funds have had a direct impact on around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and executives committed to “helping children grow to the fullest of their potential,” with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Cizens Global.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the expansion of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, he asked, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and arduous journey – sometimes we fall and we will fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of those who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement "a blockade" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its own Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russian involvement in Syria – particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern heart of Europe,” he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the possibility, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not put on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the respondents at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
“The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage financially and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “little versatile,” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, which for European consumers is by far the cheapest option.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of Nord Stream 2, a “inappropriate” pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that Nord Stream 2, a $11 billion gas pipeline designed to double the capacity of the existing one to 110 billion cubic meters, is a project of a purely economic nature.
The Kremlin objects that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at a meeting in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Energy.
The US position has triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of the European Union’s energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see it as a big problem that a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take “serious consideration” of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take "serious consideration" of running for president following the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and set up our messy government, and that implies having a woman at the top,” he said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
During the town hall, Warren said her own on President Donald Trump, stating that she was “bringing this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, who he appointed to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “It’s natural that there is a need for an FBI investigation before the vote.”
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run in 2020.
58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
The poll found greater support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in support of a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of high-profile Democrats discussed about a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump's Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September
He was arrested and charged with a case of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after he’s back, I can put it in relation to other families experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, interfering with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of a gun under narcotics, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia Support the Challenge for New Asylum Policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday presented a memo amicus curiae in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged such a policy, as reported by NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and her violent gang members' children" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a vast number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals to file an asylum application for undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy “ignore decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of the circumstances and particular circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates that principle,” the memorandum states.
Prosecutors also objected to the policy banning immigrants from entering the U.S. economy, saying there was a clear likelihood that they would become entrepreneurs and “supply necessary labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is accessible to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fears due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or political opinion," Sessions said on June 11, as part of the political line's announcement.
Asylum has never been designed to alleviate every problem -- even every serious problem -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate recovery attempts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly desperate.
“There’s a lot of tension,” 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said as she comforted her feverish little boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"At every moment there is an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, roaming among their frail personal belongings, in an attempt to recover whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, a victim of a shoulder and back fracture, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continuous strong concussion shocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he recounted the sensation of the violent earthquake that shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
“There was no time to save us.
“I was crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Making Pretenders’ with ‘Advertising Propaganda’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper, advertising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to make propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the announcement paid for by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election remarked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase of an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war that has seen them adjust their tariffs to their respective imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war had been designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now increases those pretensions by publishing advertising on our free newspapers."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, in the newspaper on the road here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese population may have about China’s problematic economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most distinguished newspapers has evaded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not state which newspaper it was.
Republicans are alienating women’s electorate ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
With many top Republicans advocating Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court and his side facing various sexual harassment charges, analysts have signaled that there will be a negative reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
"You can't withdraw these things," said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation will be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it either tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan “November is Coming!” during their protest in the Senate Hall, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Commission chose to continue Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats are going to the stars," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they were already tall; it’s true.
But they could be taller, especially among undecided suburban electricians and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote despite not liking the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had speculated that a negative reaction could have occurred if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP it has become a confusing whole," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote for the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it’s also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
In any case, Americans seem to be somewhat divided between the person to believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a smaller percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals during a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that originates from Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will have access to and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or POD.
It can include contact lists, things to do, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online store of personal data is that it is completely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to bring the appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to bring their decentralized apps to life using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not tell Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely wiped out overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to procure commercial energy and an ecosystem that help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Commemorating the Ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Church of England cleric to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
The lieutenant colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, obtained recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren inaugurated a commemorative plaque.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “magnificently symbolic” that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandparents’ award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and war machines".
He then hurried to the line of fire and with the "largest gallantry" advanced the line before running with a single hand cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never be up to and something that makes me more humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he “felt really honored to play a role in the parade” and added that “the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by so many people.”
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to be denied the vision of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some remained grounded after staying awake until the early hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter, a fan described the move to the children’s cartoon as “a kind of bad-tasting joke.”
“The government’s regulation stipulates that at six in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to move on to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pep the pig," "yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker has said he will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution until Sunday in our time zone, Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed came a lot of messages and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We’ll limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally do – and we’ve tried to get so much for the fans, and we’ve just discussed it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ to Sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality – but this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he got to high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking in the first episode of Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she made her voice heard about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also stated that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the old-fashioned program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months off for illness.
Presenting himself as an outcast in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, were the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
She wanted to prove she was “something,” she said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they accidentally found out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at this year’s Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "taken me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When so many people were young,” he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The two became parents in June, to a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “whole perspective” has changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that ‘I had to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said her father had not accepted the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I still hadn’t realized it wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze medal.
"I just knew it was what I'd dreamed of my whole life - swimming in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which had a particular meaning to him in his preparation for the Olympics and still makes him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out-of-form Mickelson put on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to get back in shape to prevent him from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a twelfth time in record time, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what tormented him.
Having never been the strongest of the drivers even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the unconnected course regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the track itself wasn’t quite daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth match, is facing up to British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of their 12 individual matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson’s match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the shoulder, put an arm around me and said he’ll be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It’s a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably hadn’t imagined playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even remotely reflected the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought intangible assets to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, cunning, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a fantastic guy to have in the meeting room,” she explained.
"I also think the younger players had a lot of fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He did a lot more than play.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon vanish.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable chase.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama in which the team, led by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point detachment from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimal advantage, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I keep repeating to myself that we had a good lead at Valderrama, we had it at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but little,” Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
“So the story will prove to me and my team that it’s not over.
Tomorrow we have to make the most of it.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It's not over until the dots are marked on the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who is on the other side: the best golfers in the world.”
Happy with the way his team competed on that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have surpassed myself.
Tomorrow’s challenge is a different one.
Tomorrow is the turn of the individual performances, which is another thing.
It’s nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re just your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, you have to get the best out of yourself.
Then you forget about your partner because he has to go there and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek out his players for the best individual performance rather than team performance, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have scored three out of four points.
The same Furyk found himself on both sides in those big games of the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing to the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the final day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start right away with the right foot, like we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the game begins to take a certain turn, the pressure increases in intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way that seems appropriate to us, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said of his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new military ship has been postponed again
According to local media, the last frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old warships of the time of the Cold War, but there will be at least until next year due to faulty systems and a surge in costs.
The commission of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying issues following delivery tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continued delays mean that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will already become obsolete when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate frigate Type F-125 made news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media noted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless if used on a combat mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the oldest Bremen-class ships.
In addition, it turned out that the ship weighs significantly too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems involving the new frigates are becoming of particular importance in light of recent alarms about the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the Navy is in fact “lack of ships that can be deployed.”
The official said the issue has worsened considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research conducted on a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal how bats use sight to procure food.
It is hoped that the findings can shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland scientists’ study will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as brown ears and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special loggers will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of bat recalls and how each species behaves.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture on a scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Bats are at risk due to construction and development work that affects trespoles and ruins the habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as mossy paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Butterflies are not really blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect triplets and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first bat-only reserve at the Threave estate in the Dumfries and Galloway region, which hosts eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The owner of the estate, David Thompson, says that the property is the ideal territory.
“Here at Threave we have a vast area for bats,” he said.
“We have ancient buildings, many centuries-old trees and a good habitat.
But there’s a lot about bats that we don’t know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs.”
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before conducting maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single maternal trident could kill up to 400 females and small ones, perhaps sweeping away an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their trophies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations are going to get through it.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Allegations as Lawyers Sue German Weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to be advertised” by his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also announced on Friday the indictment of the payment of $375,000 to maintain silence on what happened.
In a video on Instagram directed at his 142 million followers, in the hours following the accusations, Ronaldo, 33, cracked the statements as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false,” says the five-time Golden Ball facing the camera.
“They want to advertise themselves through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” added the footballer with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which are described as “an unacceptable reporting of suspicions on the private sphere.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage to the extent corresponding to the seriousness of the privacy breach, considered probably one of the most serious personal rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would return to the player's room, where he subjected her to anal violence, according to statements filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo would have fallen on his knees after the incident, saying he was a "good guy" disappointed by "one percent" for the "99 percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sexual intercourse, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also said she went to the police and hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation agreement as she felt “terrorized by retaliation” and worried about the prospect of “being publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old is now trying to overturn the deal, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he will join Italian Juventus with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: The UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "could regret forever" the loss of its status as a world leader in car manufacturing following Brexit, Industry Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "concerned" about Toyota UK's statements to the BBC about the possible withdrawal of Britain from the EU without an agreement and the consequent temporary shutdown of production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” said Minister Clark.
The Japanese automaker argues that delays at the borders, in the case of a no-deal Brexit, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s general manager at Burnaston.
There is growing concern among other British automakers about leaving the EU without a deal on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of the “just in time” concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from British and European suppliers for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border unrest that would cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day of inventory value at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely thought out to avoid these inconveniences at the borders.”
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us to enjoy not only the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely have to be able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain.”
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production could stop but, in the long run, warns that additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the plant's union delegates, says that workers are deeply concerned: "In my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reinstated."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred for a week,” as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigating Russian election interference, the ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and any obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy justice minister, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bed bug to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House and was yelling that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Wednesday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of inquiry into the FBI’s questions against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate’s final vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, I guess it will be another week considering everything that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press.”
Some journalists may dispute this statement: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Conductor Chris Wallace asked the reason.
Sanders said the briefing shortage was not due to an aversion to TV journalists "showing themselves out", although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they show themselves out."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
“The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him,” he said, adding without citing the evidence: “We checked the figures.”
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We try to do that, as in recent weeks, and this will replace the press briefings and you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president has perhaps proved his point by giving a free-wheeling, and at the same time bizarre, speech in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the European workers of the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU staff working at Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman has sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the costs of applying for settled status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: “Throughout the summer there have been continuous negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British government has also prepared itself in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, giving benefits to patients and communities to whom we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly wish you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie has been operated on after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after reporting a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost by 31 to 27, as reported by Mike Organ of The Tennessee newspaper.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
“He approached the campground and passed out,” Reed said.
First-aid personnel and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on board the camp, before putting it on a barge and taking it away for further investigation.
A Tennessee state executive told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that “we still have no information on the type and extent of the damage” and that the Tennessee states are trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with the Tennessee States after moving from the Illinois.
He had made a total of five touchdowns before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 touchdowns.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Labour Party.
The maneuver will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional resources will be in support of the Government's initiative to combat the homelessness phenomenon.
The surcharge, which adds to the current stamp duty, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy to lets, could amount to more than 3%.
The Treasury expects the manoeuvre to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, making it difficult for buyers of a first home to enter the real estate market.
Many of the country’s wealthiest areas, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson had demanded a stamp tax cut to help younger people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high by grabbing land without using it, and encouraged Prime Minister May to renounce affordable housing quotas to settle Britain’s “real estate misfortune.”
MEP Corbyn has announced a glaring array of housing market reform proposals, including rent controls and the elimination of blameless evictions.
He also wants to give the council more powers on the construction of new properties.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year I said I would be committed to restoring the British dream, that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if buying a home was just as easy for people who do not reside in the UK and for foreign companies, as it is for resident British workers.
For many people the dream of owning a home has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland’s technical director, Jack Ross, says his “maximum aspiration” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old is drawn to the challenge of reviving the Northeastern team that currently sits in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He landed at the Stadium of Light this summer after driving St. Mirren during last season's Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I’ve been in Series B and that’s it,” Ross told the BBC’s Sportssound programme.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it’s something I’ll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager.”
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he feels no anxiety about following such important names in an equally important team, having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"Success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I think I will only succeed if I can get the team back on track.”
Ross's managerial career began three years ago, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a replacement coach for the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa save himself from relegation to the third level and led St. Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his footballing career at the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical teams.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
“I really thought the manager role was done for me, more than the player.
It seems strange because I worked well, I made a living and I had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with weekly.
I still deal with them in terms of work stress and pressure but the management looks good.
I’ve always wanted to direct and now I do, I feel much more confident than I’ve ever been in my life.”

According to a study, the right time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has brought more revenue to troubled British pubs and more concern to catering services.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s commercial consultancy, put the data together and commented: “England’s persistence in the sun and long stay at the World Cup led to July following a path similar to that of June, when pubs were above 2.8 percent, while restaurants were hit the hardest.
The 1.8 percent decline in catering in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which most people drink were the most solid, with a homogeneous increase higher than the decline in restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered from the heat, although not as excessively as the restaurateurs.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent in the month, while food consumption fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s Recreation and Hospitality Analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, though a 4.8 percent drop in annual sales will be particularly burdensome in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurateurs and only time can tell if the more moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce."
Global sales growth between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in brand roll-outs.
The sales monitoring company Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants puts together and analyzes performance data across 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry’s benchmark company.
One in Five Kids Own Secret Social Media Accounts That Hide Parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, own secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Instagram” pages
The news has reinforced the fear that content will be posted against a sexual background
20 percent of students said they had a “main” account to show to parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake Instagram” accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they manage a cleaned-up “main” account to show to parents, while keeping one private.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl who urged others to “rape me.”
The research, from the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of private schools, showed that 40 percent of boys between the ages of 11 and 18 own two profiles, and half of these admitted to holding private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'voice for athletes' on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected a non-executive member of the board of Scottish Athletics during the national general assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described the nomination as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a deep respect for the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that in Scotland athletics could take a huge advantage by bringing it to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as an athlete voice and I hope to be able to contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland."
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently an opinionist of the BBC, found herself unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
The advertising of a sucker puts together mothers and cows and divides the opinion online
A breastfeeding company has shared opinion online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers and cows being put up.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "world's first silent and wearable breastfeeding", consumer technology company Elvie has launched an advertisement in the form of a funny music video to show the freedom to express themselves as mothers given the new breastfeeding.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, "Yes, I'm milking but I don't have one thing" and "If I didn't notice, these aren't breasts but my boobs."
The chorus continues: "Take it out, take it out, feed it to the children, take it out, take it out, take the milk to my lords."
However, the advertisement, published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked different reactions among viewers, many of whom claimed it highlighted the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“It’s an unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them a few days after birth.”
Titjob Elvie wears discreetly under a bra for moms
Someone else commented: "Understandably traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breastfeeding for mothers who will continue to keep their babies?”
Someone else added, "It's really pointless advertising."
Others defended it and a woman even admitted to finding the song "fun".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have one.
When I used the pacifier, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irreverent, but it does not go very far from reality.
This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a fun advertisement dedicated to moms who use breastfeeding (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'cows'."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet blowjob inserted in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breastfeeding feel like cows.
The Elvie breastfeeding machine is however completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be put into a breastfeeding bra giving women the freedom to move, hold children in their arms and even go out while pulling milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who use breastfeeding to cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breastfeeding is able to ensure.”
This is not the first time Elvie has made news.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children showed up on the catwalk of the stylist Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Move Silently to a Tendopolis on Texas Borders
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policy line of the Trump administration have made it more difficult to entrust these children.
Most of those who took them into their care were usually illegal immigrants who now fear to jeopardize the possibility of staying in the country by offering to make such a gesture.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential trustees and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and that data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had offered to take care of children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Almost 80% of the people who offer to take care of children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people,” Albence said.
To try to prosecute children faster, officials have introduced new rules whereby some of them will have to appear in court within a month of the arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to those who work at the reception points.
Many will appear in video conferencing rather than in person, to file their legal status case with an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit to receive aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer children stay in foster care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or attempts to escape, according to those who work at the reception points and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position state that the probability of this occurring is even higher in a large structure like the one in Tornillo where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for children’s signs of discomfort to be ignored.
They add that moving children to the tents without giving them time to prepare emotionally or greeting friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria intimate to US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war has reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces illegally occupy Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately without setting any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where there have been more than 360,000 deaths since 2011 and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and support Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions are favorable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of instilling "unfounded fears" that push refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
“What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be provided in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists, including al-Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to convene a new committee of government and opposition members to lay out a draft constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the group's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators may hope, his presidency should not end prematurely because of an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential finale ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of spectators bending.
As of 2014, the first-evening percentages have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in the first night, up significantly from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” program surpassed the network’s percentages by reaching 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with the most important news.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s not something that can be explained,” says Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced brilliant comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that she would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington’s events can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite or not and the health status of the global economy.
Stop following the news, however, is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow for the sixth hour in a row a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s in-depth research for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment full of trachotance” by The Washington Post) and the implications of Trump’s misrepresentations.
I won’t be able to watch Super Mario without thinking about it.
“Part of why what it does looks like a reality show is that every night there’s news,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars,” about the actors’ turnaround and day-to-day developments in the plot of the Trump show (as opposed to N.F.L. praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, or you stay behind.
This week I went to see Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in the house watching MSNBC and in the meantime recording on CNN.
He failed to break away from TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we once did all those absurd programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Influx of external money in the race for tighter midterm elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district is experiencing an influx of money thanks to the realignment of a congressional district that has made two incumbent members now running for the same seat.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburgh brings in Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that in the old districts electoral colleges had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race to the 17th district sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a landmark victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political opinionists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought to penalize El Salvador because it supports China, then changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather cordial meeting took place between Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization leadership group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to bring back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement released earlier this month.
But the decision to impose sanctions was taken only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the Americans for drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on visas, would have been worrying for the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and homicides.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September senior management officials clarified that they intended to proceed with the conference, thus definitively waiving any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been appointed to chair the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any further messages of reproach or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously about internal decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who still wanted to remain anonymous.
Study the history
In the report, special counsel Robert Mueller may accuse Trump of obstructing justice, which seems to be enough evidence.
According to reports, Mueller’s investigation aims to shed light on Trump’s possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress passes on to the Democrats, Trump should respond to these accusations in front of voters and perhaps a jury of his peers just as he prepares for a new candidacy.
There are many unknowns and I do not intend to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as is that of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
On that occasion, we failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing different challenges at the moment.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s position has been complicated since this very newspaper reported that last year it secretly suggested that Trump be intercepted by questioning his ability to serve as president.
Rosenstein argues that the news in The Times is not true.
“How will we react if the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to answer for his actions?
If we do not overcome these trials, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think that we will do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such a legacy, I can only be optimistic about the future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them excellent opportunities to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Although due to a knee injury midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season just on the occasion of the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, he believes this result can allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," said the thirty-year-old player.
"We faced the game convinced we were doing well and we brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not be able to disappoint.
"Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and changes at the club level but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation proceeds well.
So we can forget the problems of last season and think about the future.”
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term care
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of care they would like to receive, few have addressed the topic in the family.
About half of respondents from Nationwide say they have talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide, “People want it to be a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t face this conversation.”
Here's where to start.
Talk about it with your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate in time what you want.
If you have a counselor, decide together with him and your family members where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determinants of costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he can advise you on how to pay the expenses you will face.
Choosing a financing for long-term care can include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy with redemption value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and make sure professionals fulfill your wishes in case you were unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a procurator for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your accounts are paid in case you were unable to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine your elderly parent being rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just a matter of finance, but who are the doctors?” asks Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be prepared for any eventuality.”
Man shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle while he was back on foot after spending the evening outside.
The victim, a 40-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in the chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "random action".
The victim did not see his attacker.
He is not in any danger of death and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people have died in the aftermath of a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Communications were disrupted and rescue officials were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential facts about Palu and Donggala in Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main livelihoods of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and above all of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit the western area of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone called the Pacific Belt of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that swept across the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
There were more than 1,100 victims.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there were no tsunamis but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she ripped off her hand phone.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his bail was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "definitely innocent".
Palin is at risk of being charged with three first-degree offenses, including detention for up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree crime punishable by one day of detention and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under consideration by the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing the prosecution of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a punch in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder following her time in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are not working, and the death toll is set to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck off Central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social media there are videos circulating that show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Extraordinary Capital Punishment for Suspects of Terrorist Attacks in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the perpetrator of the terrorist attack that killed eight people – a rare sentence that has never been committed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to ride a bike lane along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the conditions for the death penalty in the southern New York district, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and likewise “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury issued 22 charges against Saipov that included eight counts of murder with criminal association, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “real planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, insult and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York prosecuted the last case of capital punishment.
The man on trial, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and charged with passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police say he was proud of what he did in front of the investigators.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he decided to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
With regard to the 22 indictments, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilty and sentence to life without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s group of defenders had previously urged prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Must Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one member of Theresa May’s party parliament suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” of eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone told Birmingham that the UK “would already be out of Europe” if Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges May faces to try to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party have been underscored by the Tories in favor of staying in Europe who took part in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The prime minister is trying to implement the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing euroskeptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and “chaos.”
At the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to leave the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
“By this time we would be out of Europe,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I am for Brexit but we have to leave the Chequers Plan.”
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country.”
Bone rejected the view that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in Europe is completely false.”
Tory parliamentarian Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also attended the march and told reporters: "I'm just telling the Prime Minister to listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who go around the streets chasing votes to allow us to be elected.
Let go of the Chequers Plan and start listening.”
In an incisive message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises.”
At the meeting, Farage said politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they intend to betray the decision made with the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to allow them to.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to put pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the people’s army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists pushed the Tories against the Brexit flags after the group formed this weekend.
The Labour leader ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and for borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
It's a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a city assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that Trump could challenge in 2020 has been in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington to settle the government and this implies that a woman holds the highest office.”
Arrested for the murder of the LSU Sims player
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday, he released a video of the murder asking for help identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to the head that caused his death,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the crime scene with a gun and that he had hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and held in detention at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
A nearly two-metre junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, last season Sims played 32 games, 10 of them to hold, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of teammate Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately apparent that the orders of the Mercedes team would have heavily affected the race.
From the pole, Bottas starts well, leaving Hamilton to defend against Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stopped at the boxing first, leaving Hamilton in the group’s tail traffic, a move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes makes the next lap by returning to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton outperforms him after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tries to prevent the passage inside, risking to finish out after a double shift to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first lap he is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for most of the race without stopping at the tyre change boxes and tries to finish quickly to surpass Kimi Raikkonen by taking fourth place.
In the end, however, he has to make the pit stop at the 44th lap and in the remaining 8 laps he is not able to increase the pace and overcome Raikkonen, who comes fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri worked very well all weekend and it was really nice to pass me.
The team has done an outstanding job to take first and second place,” Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
At a rally held Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence on not revealing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “wicked, bad and lying.”
"What can happen and what is happening in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, bad and lying," he said.
“When there are obvious signs that the news is being disseminated and those responsible say, ‘Oh no, it wasn’t me.
I could never do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document? - "oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it...No, we didn’t,” she added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion was leaked from his office.
"I have not concealed the accusations of Professor Ford, but I have not revealed her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to reports from The Hill.
“He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did.”
But his denial is not credible to the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented: “I’m telling you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but this is the worst example of body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of attempted sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using these accusations for their own purposes.
“They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to pass over to regain power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have recovered from Friday's defeat in the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants by winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday at Dundee.
The Giants immediately went on to score two goals on shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the draw before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored the draw for the Dundees before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third loss of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who on Friday night in Belfast had rebounded and won the game with the Dundees 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 on Kendall McFaull's assist, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assist.
In what was a rather lively first time, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the draw assistant to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the advantage for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team rebounded and Bouchard regained the tie after a strategic maneuver in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that led Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and decreed his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after dying to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have been dispersed due to a very strong earthquake that on Friday hit the island of Sulawesi causing a tsunami.
Strong landslides continue to affect the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, which was swinging fearfully.
He wanted to make sure that the Batik Air 6321 flight, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then threw himself out of the control tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He later died at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“For us, this is really sad news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the national disaster countermeasures agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is set to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many more,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything possible to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
During the year, Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Micronesia air disaster: Air Niugini now says there is a missing after lagoon crash
The airline of the flight that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people aboard between passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a missing person.
According to Air Niugini news, updated to Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing on the call.
The airline confirmed it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were able to rescue the other passengers and crew after the crash occurred while the plane was trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
According to official sources, seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline says six passengers were admitted to hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane has arrived at a very low altitude.
"And it was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he was hit slightly in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, some sailors who were working nearby to fix a pier also provided relief using a canoe to transport people to the shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that over the past two decades 111 people have died in plane crashes of airlines registered with PNG but none of these involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the burned woman alive
On Saturday, the presentation of evidence of the indictment in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis accused and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have retrieved location data from several cellphones showing that, contrary to what she said, Tellis was with the Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by saying that night he was in Sanford’s truck, Sanford confirmed that he was “lieing because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone data indicates that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
“He erased her from her life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its concluding argument on Sunday.
The judge provides that the trial will be handed over to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting positive messages in their songs.
Bristol’s The High Breed group argues that hip-hop has moved away from its origins as it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to their origins and do a kind of conscious hip-hop again.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York aunt sues a couple for firing her with a "racist" text
In New York, an aunt sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text in which the mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple denies being racist by comparing the demand to a real “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that her new aunt, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman "shamed" fired Ms. Maurice saying she was not happy with their former aunt, an African-American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
He paid Ms. Maurice for the day's work and sent her home in a taxi.
Maurice has sued the couple and, for being fired, seeks compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want them to understand that they can’t behave like this,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by saying that Maurice’s dismissal was the only thing to do as they feared they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message saying something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“Would you trust your children to a person you were rude to, even if by mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said that his wife has been giving birth for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
“You can’t get along with a person like that.
It’s not very kind behavior,” the financial adviser added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion immediately denounced the spouses on social media, harshly criticizing them for their behavior and the logic followed.
A letter reveals that the Paddington publisher feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted, commenting on the letter: "It's not easy to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s funny now that we know Paddington’s great success.”
Claiming that his father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a toy bear, would not have reacted well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
Speaking about Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family", she adds that her father was modestly proud of his success.
“He was a fairly quiet man, not a presumptuous person,” she says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he acted like he had a son who's reaching a goal - you're proud of that, even if it's not your merit.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my daughter who was dying
On landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter would not make it,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then she called me to tell me that she would be dead in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medications that the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly fading.
She died a while ago and it was the end.
I had to sit back and wait knowing all this was happening.
I could not complain, cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold myself back.”
In the end Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
“Nobody knew,” he says.
“All this time I did nothing but cry with my head down.
It’s hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Tickets of two grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide are committed to preventing others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I feel every day,” she says.
Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that it illuminated every room he entered.”
But before he died, he left work because the depression had taken him “to a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there's a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can turn to to talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don’t have to isolate themselves, they have to talk.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother's death.
“You never said you felt down or depressed,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
Christmas day touched the bottom. When the children opened the gifts, he avoided looking them in the eyes. "
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to process: "He tore the family apart.
He tore us apart.
But we had to go ahead and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain: the FBI has begun investigations
"I think if we could proceed as he asked, that is, with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was "losing calm" over the blockade of hardline supporters.
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left in the midterm elections on November 6, and if the Republicans achieve a negative result as expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to get the man they have chosen to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators, urging them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes its report?
It will be voted in the Senate, which is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break through the delays and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of political refugees “decreases” with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge from South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, says that refugees were 1,127 last year versus 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are a tighter control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs demanded by those who illegally let these people out.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
The two countries have already met in Pyongyang this month to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are in a stalemate.
This comes after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to work together to liberate the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit for the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not "characteristically fit" to fill that role.
Pelosi expressed this opinion Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman had behaved in the same way, they would have called her hysterical," Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's statement Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Visibly emotionally, Kavanaugh denied the accusation of sexually molesting Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was so emotional that he almost screamed and his throat narrowed as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats who called the accusations against him an “absurd and coordinated defamation campaign” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves he can’t enter the Supreme Court because he’s proven to be wary of Democrats.
“I think he has self-excluded himself with his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh in charge if confirmed and if the Democrats were to reach a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I think if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only is it not suitable for the Supreme Court, but not for the court that presides now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh eluded questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said: “You can’t send a hysterical person to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be accepted in a positive way.”
And women have to use it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of angry attacks from which he can't get out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, and you?"
And he went on, "A woman who was a manager somewhere helped me a lot. She told me that she was crying when she got angry, but she had developed a technique so that when she got angry and started crying she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it continued.
I thought yours was a brilliant idea.”
Tears are tolerated as outbursts of anger in part because they are fundamentally not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a male-dominated office goes back to when I once started crying for an incursion of anger. A woman older than me, a glacial manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified, grabbed me by the cot and dragged me down the stairs.
“Don’t ever see me cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they’re holding you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential race.
In 1987, when Hart's extramarital relationship was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business that had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought that there was no reason why she should not try herself to run for president.
“It wasn’t really a well-thought-out decision,” he told me, laughing about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and there was definitely no need for another.
Someone called them "Whites and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with fundraising and vowed not to run unless she had raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause at the outset.
She found that some of the supporters who had given the male candidates $1,000 to her would give only $250.
"Do they think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment at the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger at the sexual discrimination she was a victim of) that she was moved.
“It looked like you were in the grip of a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled, thinking of the reaction from the press.
“Someone might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my gravestone.
Maybe "She cried a lot."
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Favor Beijing
The opening blows of the U.S.-China trade war have been tumultuous, and while the battle is far from over, experts say a confrontation between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump has already issued the first warning this year taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on items worth more than $200 billion (175 billion euros) worth. This means that taxes will be applied on half of the goods from China.
Beijing has reacted every time with measures of the same kind by recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. one-shot and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon step back.
For Washington to renounce, it would have to yield to its demands, but to publicly bow to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US can positively affect China in the long run by decreasing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create the initial conditions for an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what has been recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security in Asia.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In front of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in Syria are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any aid subject to conditions or by those countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europa team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water at the sixteenth hole of par 3 granting victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his rounds becoming one of four players ever to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was first played in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in the standings Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, gave up for 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup veteran, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia who played eight, became the European player who won the most in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I am very happy to have won the cup again.
It’s a win for the team and I’m happy to have made my contribution,” said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the witness to his compatriot John Ram who beat the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods with the score of 2&1 in the Sunday singles.
“If I think I grew up watching his meetings, I’m really proud to have beaten Tiger Woods,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now counts his Ryder Cup matches to 13 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think he is one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team has been looking all weekend to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance from his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europa team.
We missed this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players did very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've put it all together.
They played better than us.”
